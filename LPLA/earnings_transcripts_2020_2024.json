With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Carmel, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2020, our focus remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This is a credit to our employees who responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors. Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much-needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment.  As we enter the New Year, we remain focused on executing our strategy, while also evolving our long-term vision of how we deliver on our mission. We aspire to push past our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor-centered marketplace. Our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to use in constructing the perfect practice for themselves and their clients.  More specifically, this vision centers around making it easy for advisors to join our platform with no friction or complexity, and as simple as turning dials, they can determine the exact services they want to leverage, pick the business model that will work best for them, choose the technology and workflows that make them most efficient, and select the product mix that best meets the needs of their clients, all while leveraging expertise and solutions to enhance the performance of their businesses. Ultimately, that creates total empowerment for LPL advisors to thrive and that is the heart of our mission. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. With that context in mind, let\u2019s now turn to the fourth quarter and discuss our results and progress on our strategic plan. Let\u2019s start with our fourth quarter business results. Total assets reached a new high of over $900 billion, up 18% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets prior to acquisitions were a new high of $18 billion, which translated to an 8.8% annualized growth rate. For the full year, net new assets were $56 billion, which translates to a 7.4% annualized growth rate, up from 5.3% percent a year ago. This increase was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. In the fourth quarter, Recruited Assets remained solid at $10.8 billion, which brought our full-year total to $41 billion. This was up $6 billion from a year ago and by more than 50% over the past three years, primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and continued solid execution by our business development team. In the fourth quarter, we also continued to enhance the advisor experience, as we delivered solid service outcomes driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and technology and an enhanced service experience. As a result, retention remained approximately 98% for the year, up from 96.5% percent a year ago and Net Promoter Scores increased by over 15 points year-over-year and more than 60 points in three years. Our fourth quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes, with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, which brought our full-year total to $6.46.  Let\u2019s now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategic plan. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share. Now, in light of this we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us, not only to deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth but also to increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets while advisor movement remained at lower levels over the past year, we continued to drive solid recruiting results and gain market share. To share a little more color specifically on our third-party financial institutions channel, we continue to see good momentum in the core segment of this market, and at the same time, we remain encouraged by our opportunity with regional banks. The planning and preparation for our new relationships with BMO and M&T are going well and we are in ongoing strategic dialogues with other prospects. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we anticipate our new affiliation models will also contribute additional organic growth in 2021. Following five Strategic Wealth Services practices that onboarded last year, we have a solid pipeline with a number of commitments that will join in the first half of this year. In January, we also onboarded our first Independent employee model practice and we are seeing other prospects progress through the pipeline. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a strategic lever to complement organic growth. Earlier in Q4, we onboarded a combined $4 billion of assets from our acquisitions of Lucia and EK Riley, then in December, we signed an agreement to acquire Waddell & Reed\u2019s wealth management business, which has over 900 experienced and accomplished advisors, serving approximately $70 billion of client assets. Post the signing, our teams have collaborated well with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, which is contributing to solid progress on the transaction. Thus far in the process, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have already committed to join our platform following the close of the transaction. We will give you an update on the rest of the retention pipeline next quarter. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors, differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2021, we plan to continue our work from last year, with a focus on developing capabilities and solutions in two key areas. The first is to enrich the end client experience with expanded digital solutions, enhancements to our advisory platforms and a broader set of lending solutions. The second key area is using technology, including ClientWorks and ClientWorks Connected, to help advisors enhance the performance of their practices, operate more efficiently within their key workflows and expand scalability to serve more clients. We believe these evolving capabilities will contribute to an increase in advisor growth and retention rates. Let\u2019s next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients and that in turn helps drive advisor retention. One of the key parts of this strategic play is providing advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We are doing this by transforming our service model into a client care model. We are about halfway through the implementation of this model and at this point, it has made a solid contribution to our Net Promoter Scores. We see additional opportunity to drive these outcomes higher as we deliver the second half of this initiative. We also see evolving our custodial platform operations as an opportunity to further enhance service levels, platform scalability and efficiency. As part of this work, our areas of focus include automating routine work with robotics, removing paper forms and increasing eDelivery through digitization and process re-engineering to drive continuous improvement. We believe these initiatives combined with our transformation to a client care model position us to further strengthen the advisor experience and our platform as our business grows.  Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of Business Solutions. As a reminder, when we started Business Solutions over two years ago, we saw the opportunity to help advisors find better alternatives for some local services that cost in excess of $1 billion a year. Our hypothesis was that we could provide higher quality services at a lower cost and free up additional time, for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. In that spirit, we created our Business Solutions portfolio to solve for these discreet needs, with outsourced professional expertise. Since then, we have been able to expand and evolve the value proposition of the portfolio and scale our subscription base. As a result, we finished the fourth quarter with about 1,400 monthly subscriptions, which is more than double the level a year ago. At the same time, we have expanded the portfolio to include business optimizers and additional professional services. We are also innovating on how we package these solutions such that we can unlock additional value for advisors when using a combination of different offerings. As we look ahead, we see several pathways for continued growth including partnering with more of our LPL advisors, introducing new solutions, and experimenting with serving advisors outside of LPL. In Q1, we will launch the next innovation in our portfolio M&A Solutions, which will be our sixth offering. As context, this service grew out of CFO Solutions as we identified an opportunity to help advisors acquire other practices. That inspired us to develop M&A capabilities as a service for advisors. This M&A offering will provide a turnkey solution and dedicated support for advisors from deal sourcing all the way through transaction advice, capital funding and process execution. With this offering, advisors can now more easily use M&A as a repeatable and sustainable growth engine for their practices. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today\u2019s call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2020. Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. We entered 2020 with momentum, and continued to invest through a volatile environment to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisors to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisors, resulted in the highest quarterly and full year levels of organic net new assets in our history. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we built over the last several years, we enter 2021 in an even stronger position, as we work to onboard our two largest financial institutions, M&T and BMO, as well as Waddell & Reed. So as we look ahead, we are excited to continue growing our business and leveraging our increased scale and capacity to further invest in our platform, which positions us to drive additional growth and long-term shareholder value. Now let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $903 billion, up 11% percent from Q3, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $17.8 billion or an 8.8% annualized growth rate. Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth, we continued to produce strong results in the fourth quarter. Recruited assets were $10.8 billion in Q4, which was our third consecutive quarter above $10 billion and brought our twelve-month total to a new high of $40.9 billion. At the same time, full year retention was 97.7%, an improvement of over a percentage point from last year. Looking at our business mix we continued to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $15.9 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. Our full year total was $50 billion, up almost 50% from last year and more than doubled our total in 2018. Centrally managed platforms also continued to grow, as net new assets reached a new quarterly high of $2.5 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate. Now let\u2019s turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, up 6% sequentially. Looking at our topline growth, gross profit was $534 million, up $28 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components commission and advisory fees net of payout were $153 million, up $11 million from Q3, primarily driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $153 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially, as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $105 million, down $4 million from Q3, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $49 billion, up $2 billion sequentially.  As for client cash yields, our Q4 ICA yield was 108 basis points, down 10 basis points from Q3. The decrease was primarily driven by $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter and higher cash balances. Looking ahead to Q1, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contacts that matured in Q4, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q1. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q4, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to be around 100 basis points. Roughly half of the decline is driven by growth in balances, while the other half is driven by fixed rate contract maturities. Moving on to Q4 transaction and fee revenues, they were $130 million, up $10 million sequentially, driven by higher trading volume and fee revenue. Looking ahead to Q1, while we acknowledge the widely discussed increase in activity in the self-directed space, our trading levels have remained more stable and consistent with what we would expect to see in the advisor-led wealth management space. As a result, our trading activity through January is in line with Q4 levels. That said, I would note, there are three fewer trading days and seasonally lower fee revenue in Q1. So we expect these two items to reduce transaction and fee revenue by $5 million. Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,400 subscriptions at the end of Q4. This is up 200 from last quarter, and double our total from a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $17 million of annual recurring gross profit, up from $15 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $252 million in Q4, leading to full year Core G&A of $925 million, in the lower half of our original outlook range of $915 million to $940 million.  Turning to our outlook for 2021, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth, while delivering operating leverage in our core business. Looking back, over the last three years our Core G&A has grown in the mid single-digit range annually as we invested to drive growth. And over the same period, these investments have helped our organic growth more than double from 3% to 7%. Given the success we are seeing with these investments, we are planning the same level of Core G&A growth we planned last year, which was 5.5% to 8%. So for 2021, this translates to a range of $975 million to $1 billion. I would note, this includes costs to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed. Moving on to Q4 promotional expenses, they were $48 million, down $10 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses following our national sales conference in Q3. Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $10 million, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from recruiting, and BMO and M&T on-boarding expenses. Looking ahead, we anticipate BMO will join by the end of Q1 and M&T will join during the middle of this year. Now let\u2019s talk about Waddell & Reed. We are excited about the transaction and encouraged by the progress we are making with advisors. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have committed to join our platform, following the close of the transaction. This puts us above our 70% modeling assumption, thus far in the process. I would also note, Waddell & Reed Wealth Management assets at the end of Q4 were $70 billion, which is up $7 billion from Q3.  With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Waddell & Reed, we will have updated estimates as we move towards the close and onboarding dates, which we expect to be in the middle of this year. That said, today I would like to provide some color on the acquisition and integration costs, which we continue to estimate will be approximately $85 million. That said, to provide more transparency, we will add an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L beginning next quarter. We think reviewing our results prior to these acquisition costs will be helpful in understanding our financials. So starting in Q1, we will report our results as EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs. As we look ahead, our integration work is progressing well and we anticipate up to $10 million of acquisition costs in Q1. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $8 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. Looking ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock awards, so we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $29 million in Q4, up $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in technology and recently rolled out several improvements to our advisory platform and end client experience. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by $4 million sequentially.  Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with credit agreement net leverage at 2.16 times and cash available for corporate use of $280 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the near-term, we expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A, as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities. And if at that time we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A opportunities, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our opportunities look like at that time. In closing, we delivered another quarter and year of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, Dan. Hey, Matt. Good afternoon.\nDan Arnold: Hi.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start with a question on organic growth. As you noted, you are coming off a record year organic growth north of 7% 4Q was your strongest quarter and 9%. So momentum was clearly building nicely towards year end. I was hoping you could speak to what you are seeing in terms of the backlog across both the traditional market, as well as some of the newer camps and how that compares with the year ago levels. Is this what\u2019s informing your confidence around the sustainability of that 7% plus organic growth rate from here?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Steven, so let me let me take a stab at that, and please, if I don\u2019t get it all, you ask a follow on? So, look, the short answer is, as we said in the remarks, we think that pace around 7% is sustainable. And then we continue to challenge ourselves to expand on that growth rate. So let me give you a little color as to how we think about that. I think one quick way to orient yourself to it is, how do we get to where we are over the last call it three years and that\u2019s been driven by new store sales increasing by 50% over that period of time, which has come almost totally out of our traditional markets. Retention rates have improved from 96% to 98% over that period of time. So that\u2019s also a helpful contribution. And then same-store sales continue kind of a steady, durable, increase over that period of time. And so what you have done is you have gone over that period of time from roughly below 3% organic growth rate to 7%. Now, as we look ahead, relative to the opportunity to both sustain, but more importantly, grow that rate, we look to new store sales first, and see the new markets that we have entered, the strategic wealth services model, the independent employee model and the RA markets, and obviously, see a much bigger opportunity set with momentum building inside those three new offerings, which largely haven\u2019t contributed a whole lot to our growth up to this point. So that that\u2019s one opportunity. Certainly this emerging new bank opportunity with respect to larger banks exploring outsourcing is a second way to think about an opportunity going forward. And then we continue to improve our own efficacy of our business development team and its capabilities to grow and win at higher rates. That\u2019s a third one as we continue to innovate there. And then, finally, I think we continue to innovate around onboarding and the more seamless we can make that we believe creates two more movement in the marketplace in the future. So those are how we think about opportunities and new store sales. I think it would be, if you click over the same-store sales for a minute, we see the opportunity to continue to drive automation into the advisors key workflows that then they get the benefits of efficiency, freeing up time to reallocate to more valuable activities. We also see this technology creating more scalability in their practices. So they can obviously attracted support more clients. We continue to build out new solutions for their organic growth efforts. And finally, this new M&A Solutions becomes yet another way for them to create another lever to grow their practices. So across new store and same-store says you have got multiple oars in the water that we are working on, in order to drive that rate higher. If we are successful on executing on these, well, then you can see where the logic around the opportunity set grows and we deliver higher growth rates. I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: No. That\u2019s great, Dan, a very fulsome response. So thanks for all that color. And maybe just follow up for Matt, just on the ICA outlook. The lack of deposit appetite from third-party banks, it\u2019s something we have been hearing from you and also for many of your competitors. Typically, we don\u2019t see demand for cash increase until short rates start to rise. Clients are to engage in some form of cash sorting. And if we enter a prolonged period where short rates are at zero, but the yield curve steepens materially. How do you see demand from third-party banks evolving? Do you anticipate you are going to have opportunities to turn out the cash, take advantage of this deepening and if cash balance continue to build from here, should we assume that that\u2019s going to fall into the overflow bucket? Are there opportunities to maybe optimize the pricing there as well?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Steven, I think, you summarized the market well. I think right now there is so much liquidity in the market from lots of sources that you all know that there\u2019s just not a lot of demand for the banks on the sweet fund side. So I think you see that the balance is flowing into overflow contracts, a little over $2 billion this quarter. And I think in the near-term, that\u2019s likely where cash would go. But I think on your point and your scenario, as we move past, what I call, just kind of the technicals of the market right now. I think in an environment where near-term rates are low, but the curve starts to steepen. I think there\u2019s opportunities to move into fixing that environment, right? So, of course, it\u2019s always hard to predict. But I think this environment we are in right now is really just driven by that excess cash. Now, when you look at our financials, right, and we target and being in the 50% to 75% zone for fixed, and we are hovering in the kind of a third of the 35% zone, there\u2019s pretty meaningful upside when we are able to do that. So I think we are comfortable long-term that opportunity is there. But today that -- it\u2019s -- there\u2019s just not a lot of demand.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great, Matt. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nMatt Audette: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your question, please.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. Good evening, everybody. Appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe, Dan, start with you. So I am intrigued by your commentary about maybe taking Business Solutions on the road. I was just wondering if you could maybe flesh out how you sort of thinking about that beta test, what kind of milestones you might be looking for and then how do you think about the TAM associated with that?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. So, Bill, good question. I -- look, first of all, these Business Solutions are subscription based services, right? So that gives us flexibility as to how an advisor can plug in and leverage the LPL platform. So that\u2019s the premise where you have a bit more flexibility in this concept about being able to serve advisors outside of the LPL family, if you will. And today we are focused on continuing to innovate and deliver those services for LPL advisors. So that\u2019s where the majority of our allocation of investment goes across this strategic play. And that\u2019s allowing us to continue to learn and innovate on our offering. That said, our hypothesis is, these services could potentially be offered to all 300,000 financial advisors in the marketplace. If you think about that premise of, if I am operating my own business and I have local level services that are necessary to support the operation of that business. Well, then we believe we can step in and create higher quality solutions at a lower cost using automation and digital capabilities to create real interesting scalability. And you began to see where you could take for an example, take our M&A Solutions that we were just talking about and if we do that well for LPL advisors, then we could easily take that and point that to an advisor that doesn\u2019t necessarily sit on our platform today and help create growth opportunities associated with a practice by providing or plugging in to that type of solution. So that\u2019s the concept. Your right, call it, an experimental phase now. I think it\u2019s logical for us in our overall journey around this play to begin to experiment there and it\u2019s early days of that experiment. We will likely take one of these solutions and begin to explore how that might work and present itself outside of the of the LPL family of advisors. And that will allow us some learning that didn\u2019t apply and further innovate on how we might take this portfolio outside the LPL advisor base. I hope that helps.\nBill Katz: That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the incremental change there. Follow up question is for you, Dan or for Matt, two-part. So I apologize for sneaking that extra question in. But so on the 20% of the Waddell Financial advisor that haven\u2019t agreed to this point, I was wondering if you can provide some color on why not? And then could you just help me understand, I apologize if I show you know this, the interplay between the integration charges associated with Waddell and any flow through onto the Core G&A line? Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Thanks, Bill. I will take the first part of that and Matt, you take the second. How about that?\nMatt Audette: Pretty good.\nDan Arnold: So, Bill, as you recall, we announced the transaction in early December and at that point we began our retention efforts associated with the Waddell & Reed advisors. And so we have been at that largely six weeks. And so what you are seeing is that 80% retention rate has more to do with just the timing and where we are in the overall process than anything else. As Matt said, we expect to close and convert in the second quarter. So there\u2019s still time left to have that ongoing dialogue and make sure that all advisors can make an informed choice around where that best option is for them. So think about that just as more where we are in the timing process than anything else. Matt, do you want to take the second part of that?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Sure. Bill on the Waddell & Reed expenses, they are not included in Core G&A. So we are going to have a separate line item that includes the acquisition and integration expenses. So you can clearly see that and there weren\u2019t any in Q4.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you. I will follow up offline. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your question, please.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey. Good afternoon, Dan, Matt, and congrats on the record organic growth.\nDan Arnold: Hey. Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So I am just wanted to start with the Waddell & Reed transaction first. So its advisors hold a very high percentage of Waddell and IV product. How do you think about the trajectory for them to reinvest this product into other funds and could this have any economic impact on LPL or the commission rates and shelf fees roughly in line with the product on LPL platform?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Do you want me.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Take that Matt and then I will add color around that.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. It sounds good. So, Craig, I would just highlight the partnership with Macquarie that really that we worked with on this transaction together. So I think when we look on the other side of closing and integration, I think we see ourselves continuing to be that strong partner with Macquarie, meaning the IV Funds moving over to their platform. So I think that relationship and that synergy being able to continue the experience that what all advisors have with those funds today. On the other side of this transaction was a really, really important part of the, I think, what made this deal exciting for all three parties. So I just wanted to give you, just emphasize that from a strategic level and then Dan is anything you would add.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. More from an operational standpoint, we don\u2019t expect some big reallocation or shift in, how they are thinking about their portfolios or using what will then be Macquarie product on a go forward basis. So, I don\u2019t think you are going to see some big step function change in terms of the allocation of those assets. So I am not sure you see any then knock on effect from that, which is the second part of your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Helpful. And I had one question on the production retention, it\u2019s still at a really nice level, but we have watched it go down for three quarters now. Can you talk about any puts and takes or seasonality that could be acting -- that could be impacting 4Q or any other perspective on it would be helpful?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. I think you are talking about our overall retention inside LPL. And look, I think, this is mainly just, you have seen it increase throughout the year, which is largely a matter of timing related to the impact the pandemic had in the early part of the year. So where might have been more complex or tougher inside that four-month to five-month period of real uncertainty. I think you just see now some of that pulling through. As we think about it and look at it over the full year, you have got 98% retention, and as I shared last quarter, we think about a good sustainable range being somewhere around 2% to 3% of attrition or said differently 97% to 98% retention. So that\u2019s what we are trying to manage to and work to and we feel good about the client experience and the advisor experience we are providing. And that is the primary driver of that attrition rate or retention rate and so that\u2019s kind of how we are managing to it and thinking about it. I hope that helps.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, guys. Good evening. I wanted to ask you around TA packages that are out there in the marketplace right now. Obviously, Raymond James talked about seeing a little bit more pressure in that market, sounds like that\u2019s more in the employee channel, which is small for you guys for now, but curious if you seeing any meaningful change there? And maybe, Matt on -- Matt, the follow on is for you, I guess, with respect to promotional expense, to what extent that\u2019s putting some incremental pressure on promotional expense for you guys into \u201821?\nDan Arnold: I will take the first half of that and then Matt, I will turn it over to you. So, look, the short answer is, we are not seeing a lot of change in transition assistance rates this time. And you said it as a core principle for us, we determined transition assistance on a return basis approach and our TA rates have been stable over the last few quarters and as we enter this New Year, we don\u2019t see that changing. And when we look ahead, we think about TA and how it\u2019s currently positioned or transition assistance, along with the rest of our value proposition from capabilities, technology and service and believe that that\u2019s an overall really solid competitive offering and believe, as we go forward, that it will be a source of us continuing to gain market share. Do you want to talk about promotional expense?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I think I was just building what Dan said, I think, with the rates being stable, I think promo and the transition assistance amortization. If that\u2019s going up in a meaningful way, it\u2019s simply because recruiting and therefore organic growth has gone up. So I think it will move along with our recruiting success and the rates themselves really have been quite stable.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Perfect. And then just a follow up on Waddell & Reed, I know you guys give a little bit of color on the kind of the composition of the assets, et cetera, at the time that the deal was announced. But on the 80% that you already sort of retained, an you give us an update on sort of what\u2019s the gross profit ROAs on that base and the mix of assets kind of equity fixed income? Thanks.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Not yet. I think it\u2019s a little bit early. I think as we move towards close and onboard and we will start to get more updates on overall economics. I think, today we wanted to really highlight the early success on the retention front. So we will give you more on that at a future date.\nAlex Blostein: All right. We will stay tune. Thanks.\nMatt Audette: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nChris Harris: Yeah. Thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit about your risk management controls and what you are doing to keep risk reasonably well controlled with all the growth that you guys are seeing across the platform?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Let me take that one and then, certainly, you can add anything to that. Look, it\u2019s a core component and value proposition of what we offer, both from a protection of -- to the firm, to the advisors, to the clients. But it\u2019s also a really important value proposition for us of taking complexity out of this business and simplifying it to enable the advisors to operate their businesses successfully. So it\u2019s a place that we have constantly have to innovate on regardless of our growth rates, but in a world where you are growing that just creates more opportunity to allocate resources to think about how you improve the efficacy and the efficiency of compliance and our overall risk management programs. And though we are not perfect and though we will try to play into that, I think, look, there\u2019s key components of our overall risk profile that we look at. There\u2019s some 16 different risk components that we actively monitor and review how we are doing in, in those areas. So think about that is managing your day-to-day risk or your operational risk. And then as a complement to that, there\u2019s that strategic opportunity that says, hey, how do we take and use robotics and artificial intelligence and automation of which to enrich the efficacy of our supervision, of our oversight? How do we imagine new ways of which to use technology to drive efficiency into what we do, which simply just then creates much more scalability to support that growth. And so we look at it through an operational lens and track that on a monthly basis and hold ourselves accountable to constantly iterating and learning and applying what we are doing well and or not to improve it and then we allocate resources to drive innovation to do it better. And look, our goal is to take risk management and turn it into an asset. If we continue to invest in it and we can do it better and cheaper than anyone else, it becomes a differentiator. And so that\u2019s how we think about our risk management programs and that\u2019s sort of what is our Northstar [ph], if you will, with respect to risk management.\nChris Harris: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your question, please.\nJeremy Campbell: Hey. Thanks. Looks like a really nice December drove the big robust with acceleration and M&A growth, but also it\u2019s like your recruited assets was pretty stable with prior couple of quarters. So just wondering if you could unpack some of the key drivers behind the December pickup?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. It\u2019s Matt. I think when you look at the interest and dividends component of that and as to your observation that happens typically in the third month of each quarter. And then in the third month of Q4, at year end in December, you have got a lot of funds that will distribute things annually. So that was a driver of it. But even if he had kind of pulled that uptick out, when you look at our growth rate in Q4 at 8.8%, that was about a 0.5 percentage point, so still above an 8% organic growth rate. So really, really strong quarter in our view, but that interest dynamic that happens at the end of the year was the thing that bias December up over that.\nDan Arnold: And if I added anything to that, I think, if click down on that, this is where you see that durable, but steady trend upward in same-store sales, where you are seeing advisors doing a really great job of serving and supporting their existing clients. So they are actually capturing assets from those existing clients at a higher rate than historically and certainly pre-pandemic. At the same time, we have seen them now return to capturing or acquiring new clients at the rates, they were pre-pandemic and so some of that dynamic underneath fourth quarter is certainly supportive of increasing growth rates both across the quarter, I am sorry, across the whole quarter and ramping up within the quarter.\nJeremy Campbell: Got it. Great. And then, Dan, you gave some really nice high level color around with the growth trajectory going forward to an earlier question, but I don\u2019t know whether this is for you or for Matt, but can you just give us a quick update around how January activity is shaping up so far or will shape up?\nDan Arnold: Matt, do you want to take that.\nMatt Audette: Yeah.\nDan Arnold: Yeah.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I will take that one, Jeremy. Since we are sitting here in February, we certainly have some thoughts on January. So, overall, it pretty well. I mean, we are still finalizing the results. But I would describe it as growth consistent with what we saw in 2020, right. So nice organic growth. There are a couple of things to highlight though for January by its nature, kind of the building on how are we just talking about December, by its nature, that drives NNA a little bit lower for that month. The first one is December recruiting. I think you know this well, but FINRA shuts down for the last week or two of the year. So you just don\u2019t have new advisors coming onto the platform. So it naturally slows NNA down in the beginning -- the early parts of January each year. And then just building on what we are talking about December, while month three is the highest kind of interest and fees driven NNA of the month, month one is the lowest, right, because you have the advisor fees coming out primarily in the first month of the quarter. So those two things together kind of put a naturally have you -- have a decline in January, when I put all that together, I think, we would expect January to be in the 4% to 5% growth -- organic growth. But again, we will finalize those results and release them in a couple weeks.\nJeremy Campbell: Perfect. Thanks a lot.\nMatt Audette: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your question, please.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good evening. Just a couple of follow ups on promotional expenses. I am wondering if you have any update on how much TA you are contemplating for the Waddell deal, whether TA rates associated with those Waddell assets you are expecting to onboard? And then separately, how should we think about the return of some higher non-TA related promotional expenses in a post pandemic world? Maybe frame how much expense benefit you realize there in 2020 due to lower conference spend or something else?\nMatt Audette: Okay. Okay. I guess. Yeah. So, Kyle, I will start there. I think on the Waddell side, I think, we and Dan talked about our approach and thoughts on TA a little bit earlier. And I\u2019d say, we have the same approach with Waddell. So there\u2019s really no different approach. They are making sure that we put those advisors in a position to successfully transition onto our platform. That\u2019s what transition assistance is for. And we will underwrite it in the same way. I think on the conference side of things and I will get a little color here, and Dan, if you want to jump in. But I think as we evolve over time, I think, like most folks we see on the other side of the pandemic doing a mix of continued virtual and digital things, but also, people value getting together in person. I think, especially in the independent advisory space, folks value getting together. So I likely see us having a mix of what we had pre-pandemic, but it\u2019s a little bit early to kind of call where and how those numbers start to change. So we will keep you updated a quarter ahead of time kind of how we gave -- how we did here today on promotional for next quarter. That\u2019s on a cost side. I don\u2019t know Dan if there is anything you want to add.\nDan Arnold: No. well said.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. All right. We are all good there, Kyle.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Your question, please.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks and good evening, folks. Matt, perhaps, you could give a little bit more detail just around the Waddell timeline as it relates now to the close advisor onboarding and synergy runway. I know you had a nice graphic in the presentation last quarter and I may have missed it this time around, but if you could help us just kind of walk through that a little bit, that would be appreciated?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Sure. Gerry, we didn\u2019t update it, but it\u2019s unchanged. So I think when we think about the next key dates, which are closing into the subsequent asset transfer. Our estimate for that is the middle of this year and then the integration, the on-boarding process, et cetera occurs after that and I think that will lead to an EBITDA benefit ramp of about 12 months after closing. So if you think we are closing and onboarding in the middle of this year, that will have us reach that run rate EBITDA estimate by the middle of next year or the middle of 2022. Yeah, so that\u2019s what was in that presentation and those estimates are the same today.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, I think in the prepared remarks, Dan, you mentioned kind of the evolving opportunity around the custodial platform. Is there any potential kind of color you could add or context as to what that opportunity might be sizing or just, I guess, clients advisors anything you might be able to add would be helpful?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Hi. I will just give you a higher level macro overview at this point. I think we can give you more color as we move forward. But with respect to our RA offering, we currently provide this solution to a number of advisors. That said, we are investing in our capabilities and resources that we believe match that growing opportunity set. As we do expect over the next few years more advisor movement or churn across that space. And so we believe we can put together an interesting differentiated solution that will contribute to our ongoing organic growth and be a nice contribution to increasing that organic growth rate. So that\u2019s how we see that and where we are is continuing to make sure we have got that differentiated solution and that we have got the resources in place to take that to the market. So more color on that as we go forward throughout the year, but hopefully that gives you a sort of our jumping off-point.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions this evening.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your question, please.\nChris Shutler: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. On the $10 million expected increase in promotional expense quarter-over-quarter, how much of that is BMO and M&T, and how much is something else? I am guessing marketing and conference expense are reasonably stable sequentially, so I am just trying to figure out if that Q1 level is kind of a new jumping off point or how to think about anything that might be that\u2019s more seasonal or one-time?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Chris, M&T and BMO are about half of that. There are large financial institutions where there is a bit more technology, a bit more on-boarding support, so that\u2019s why you see that increase. And well, I wouldn\u2019t call that one-time. I call it connected to on-boarding a large financial institution. So anytime we have those coming, you will see a little bit of a pickup in promotional for that, but it is, to your point, it\u2019s not recurring, it\u2019s just associated with those firms. And the rest of it\u2019s really -- there is a handful of things in there, but it\u2019s primarily tied to transition assistance amortization as we continue to recruit.\nChris Shutler: Okay. So the half associated with the two big banks is not amortization of transition assistance, it\u2019s other stuff?\nMatt Audette: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\nChris Shutler: Okay.\nMatt Audette: They haven\u2019t joined yet. So that wouldn\u2019t have begun.\nChris Shutler: Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. And then the other one was just on the new M&A offering, maybe just give us a sense of how you plan to price that offering. I am guessing the workload there could vary a decent bit depending on the advisory firm that you are working with or the complexity of the target. So help us think through how to sort of think about that?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Let me give you a little color on that, and again, I think, there is more to play out here as we go forward. So I can -- if I can answer anything -- everything today, I think, we can give you that color over the next couple of months. And so with respect to our M&A solutions, again what we are trying to solve for is actually helping advisors acquire other practices to integrate into their businesses, right? So that\u2019s the context, and quite frankly, we realized and recognized and working with our advisors, that many of them saw this as an opportunity, but saw the complexity associated with M&A really hard and it kept them out of exploring those opportunities. So our concept was, could we go create or build a solution that makes it much easier and simpler for them to go from point A to Z in that M&A process and thus in building a platform that helps them do that. If they do it once, then we are going to increase the odds, that they can do it again and again, you sort of create this repeatable, sustainable growth lever for them and a bit of a flywheel, if you think about it across a larger number of advisors. So that\u2019s the concept. And so what we have done over the last year is build that end-to-end platform for ourselves. So we will deliver that with LPL resources. So we have got a technology platform we have built that will host that and drive that and digitize that and make that easier. We obviously have access to the marketplace and will help facilitate that marketplace of buyers and sellers. We can give good transaction advice around that. We know this well and we know the models well. So we can provide advisor and we are positioned to do that and we can also provide the capital funding or an option to the advisor for their capital funding. So it\u2019s really delivered by us. We are not working with other advisory firms. And again, us doing it as a service, our opportunity is to certainly charge for the value that we are providing associated with managing through that process. But the real win for us is at the end of it is helping these advisors capture assets and grow on the platform. And so that\u2019s how we think about that. That\u2019s how you would see us pricing it associated with the more discounted fees for the value that we provide in the M&A process knowing that we can both help retain and grow organic assets on our platform. So I hope that helps you get the principles in the macro way we are thinking about it, more to come when we roll it out on pricing and things of that nature and that will happen in this quarter.\nChris Shutler: All right. Thank you, Matt and Dan.\nDan Arnold: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good evening and thanks for squeezing me in here. I just want to come back to the client cash levels, looks like the allocations there came in a bit 5.4%, client cash allocations. I guess how do you see that evolving from here? Where do you see that leveling out say a year or two from now? And what environment, would you say that it would be higher or lower and has there anything changed structurally that could result in a different cash allocation than what we have seen historically on your platform?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. I mean, I think, it\u2019s -- I mean when you -- maybe the book in to look at, right? If you look at the periods that we have got in our key metrics supplement, right? We -- you kind of bottomed out in the low 4% range and think of that as probably the max deployed in the market that we have seen and then the other extreme is, when you go back years and years ago when you have seen the max pullback is in the 9% to 10%. So it kind of feels like where we are right now at least with recent history, balances are a little bit high. I don\u2019t think it would surprise us if you get on the other side of a pandemic with vaccines out and whatever environment you would describe as the new normal. It wouldn\u2019t surprise us if that -- if you saw that 5.4% start to go back down as you see money go into the market. But I\u2019d emphasize of course that\u2019s a really hard one to predict. But I think if -- when we look at the history that we have, that\u2019s probably what we would expect to see.\nMichael Cyprys: Got it. And just a quick follow-up on the money fund and DCA yields there, they continue to come in the fourth quarter. Just curious, any color you could share on the drivers there and what would need to happen to see further compression or -- and what scenario, could it even go negative or how do you think about any sort of floor on that and thoughts into \u201821?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Remember DCA was a little bit challenging, because it\u2019s a fee-per-account, not a rate. So balances moving around can just change that reported rate, because it\u2019s a fee-per-account type fee. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that -- the move into that much. On the money market side, I think, you are just seeing the dynamic of interest rates being near zero and those products where the product manufacturers can waive fees that puts a little bit of pressure on the yields. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that you unexpected in an environment where Fed funds is in the 7, 8, 9 zone. I think that\u2019s what you expect to see on money funds. And of course emphasize, when you look at the balances, those are -- of our nearly $50 billion in client cash balances those are pretty small piece of the overall pie.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Dan Arnold for his final remarks.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Thank you, Carmel. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s program and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2020. Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. We entered 2020 with momentum, and continued to invest through a volatile environment to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisors to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisors, resulted in the highest quarterly and full year levels of organic net new assets in our history. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we built over the last several years, we enter 2021 in an even stronger position, as we work to onboard our two largest financial institutions, M&T and BMO, as well as Waddell & Reed. So as we look ahead, we are excited to continue growing our business and leveraging our increased scale and capacity to further invest in our platform, which positions us to drive additional growth and long-term shareholder value. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $903 billion, up 11% percent from Q3, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $17.8 billion or an 8.8% annualized growth rate. Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth, we continued to produce strong results in the fourth quarter. Recruited assets were $10.8 billion in Q4, which was our third consecutive quarter above $10 billion and brought our twelve-month total to a new high of $40.9 billion. At the same time, full year retention was 97.7%, an improvement of over a percentage point from last year. Looking at our business mix we continued to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $15.9 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. Our full year total was $50 billion, up almost 50% from last year and more than doubled our total in 2018. Centrally managed platforms also continued to grow, as net new assets reached a new quarterly high of $2.5 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate. Now let's turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, up 6% sequentially. Looking at our topline growth, gross profit was $534 million, up $28 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components commission and advisory fees net of payout were $153 million, up $11 million from Q3, primarily driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $153 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially, as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $105 million, down $4 million from Q3, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $49 billion, up $2 billion sequentially.  As for client cash yields, our Q4 ICA yield was 108 basis points, down 10 basis points from Q3. The decrease was primarily driven by $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter and higher cash balances. Looking ahead to Q1, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contacts that matured in Q4, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q1. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q4, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to be around 100 basis points. Roughly half of the decline is driven by growth in balances, while the other half is driven by fixed rate contract maturities. Moving on to Q4 transaction and fee revenues, they were $130 million, up $10 million sequentially, driven by higher trading volume and fee revenue. Looking ahead to Q1, while we acknowledge the widely discussed increase in activity in the self-directed space, our trading levels have remained more stable and consistent with what we would expect to see in the advisor-led wealth management space. As a result, our trading activity through January is in line with Q4 levels. That said, I would note, there are three fewer trading days and seasonally lower fee revenue in Q1. So we expect these two items to reduce transaction and fee revenue by $5 million. Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,400 subscriptions at the end of Q4. This is up 200 from last quarter, and double our total from a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $17 million of annual recurring gross profit, up from $15 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $252 million in Q4, leading to full year Core G&A of $925 million, in the lower half of our original outlook range of $915 million to $940 million.  Turning to our outlook for 2021, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth, while delivering operating leverage in our core business. Looking back, over the last three years our Core G&A has grown in the mid single-digit range annually as we invested to drive growth. And over the same period, these investments have helped our organic growth more than double from 3% to 7%. Given the success we are seeing with these investments, we are planning the same level of Core G&A growth we planned last year, which was 5.5% to 8%. So for 2021, this translates to a range of $975 million to $1 billion. I would note, this includes costs to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed. Moving on to Q4 promotional expenses, they were $48 million, down $10 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses following our national sales conference in Q3. Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $10 million, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from recruiting, and BMO and M&T on-boarding expenses. Looking ahead, we anticipate BMO will join by the end of Q1 and M&T will join during the middle of this year. Now let's talk about Waddell & Reed. We are excited about the transaction and encouraged by the progress we are making with advisors. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have committed to join our platform, following the close of the transaction. This puts us above our 70% modeling assumption, thus far in the process. I would also note, Waddell & Reed Wealth Management assets at the end of Q4 were $70 billion, which is up $7 billion from Q3.  With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Waddell & Reed, we will have updated estimates as we move towards the close and onboarding dates, which we expect to be in the middle of this year. That said, today I would like to provide some color on the acquisition and integration costs, which we continue to estimate will be approximately $85 million. That said, to provide more transparency, we will add an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L beginning next quarter. We think reviewing our results prior to these acquisition costs will be helpful in understanding our financials. So starting in Q1, we will report our results as EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs. As we look ahead, our integration work is progressing well and we anticipate up to $10 million of acquisition costs in Q1. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $8 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. Looking ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock awards, so we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $29 million in Q4, up $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in technology and recently rolled out several improvements to our advisory platform and end client experience. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by $4 million sequentially.  Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with credit agreement net leverage at 2.16 times and cash available for corporate use of $280 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the near-term, we expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A, as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities. And if at that time we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A opportunities, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our opportunities look like at that time. In closing, we delivered another quarter and year of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, Operator, please open the call for questions. Yeah. Steven, I think, you summarized the market well. I think right now there is so much liquidity in the market from lots of sources that you all know that there's just not a lot of demand for the banks on the sweet fund side. So I think you see that the balance is flowing into overflow contracts, a little over $2 billion this quarter. And I think in the near-term, that's likely where cash would go. But I think on your point and your scenario, as we move past, what I call, just kind of the technicals of the market right now. I think in an environment where near-term rates are low, but the curve starts to steepen. I think there's opportunities to move into fixing that environment, right? So, of course, it's always hard to predict. But I think this environment we are in right now is really just driven by that excess cash. Now, when you look at our financials, right, and we target and being in the 50% to 75% zone for fixed, and we are hovering in the kind of a third of the 35% zone, there's pretty meaningful upside when we are able to do that. So I think we are comfortable long-term that opportunity is there. But today that -- it's -- there's just not a lot of demand. You bet. Pretty good. Yeah. Sure. Bill on the Waddell & Reed expenses, they are not included in Core G&A. So we are going to have a separate line item that includes the acquisition and integration expenses. So you can clearly see that and there weren't any in Q4. Yeah. Do you want me. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. It sounds good. So, Craig, I would just highlight the partnership with Macquarie that really that we worked with on this transaction together. So I think when we look on the other side of closing and integration, I think we see ourselves continuing to be that strong partner with Macquarie, meaning the IV Funds moving over to their platform. So I think that relationship and that synergy being able to continue the experience that what all advisors have with those funds today. On the other side of this transaction was a really, really important part of the, I think, what made this deal exciting for all three parties. So I just wanted to give you, just emphasize that from a strategic level and then Dan is anything you would add. Yeah. I think I was just building what Dan said, I think, with the rates being stable, I think promo and the transition assistance amortization. If that's going up in a meaningful way, it's simply because recruiting and therefore organic growth has gone up. So I think it will move along with our recruiting success and the rates themselves really have been quite stable. Yeah. Not yet. I think it's a little bit early. I think as we move towards close and onboard and we will start to get more updates on overall economics. I think, today we wanted to really highlight the early success on the retention front. So we will give you more on that at a future date. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. It's Matt. I think when you look at the interest and dividends component of that and as to your observation that happens typically in the third month of each quarter. And then in the third month of Q4, at year end in December, you have got a lot of funds that will distribute things annually. So that was a driver of it. But even if he had kind of pulled that uptick out, when you look at our growth rate in Q4 at 8.8%, that was about a 0.5 percentage point, so still above an 8% organic growth rate. So really, really strong quarter in our view, but that interest dynamic that happens at the end of the year was the thing that bias December up over that. Yeah. Yeah. I will take that one, Jeremy. Since we are sitting here in February, we certainly have some thoughts on January. So, overall, it pretty well. I mean, we are still finalizing the results. But I would describe it as growth consistent with what we saw in 2020, right. So nice organic growth. There are a couple of things to highlight though for January by its nature, kind of the building on how are we just talking about December, by its nature, that drives NNA a little bit lower for that month. The first one is December recruiting. I think you know this well, but FINRA shuts down for the last week or two of the year. So you just don't have new advisors coming onto the platform. So it naturally slows NNA down in the beginning -- the early parts of January each year. And then just building on what we are talking about December, while month three is the highest kind of interest and fees driven NNA of the month, month one is the lowest, right, because you have the advisor fees coming out primarily in the first month of the quarter. So those two things together kind of put a naturally have you -- have a decline in January, when I put all that together, I think, we would expect January to be in the 4% to 5% growth -- organic growth. But again, we will finalize those results and release them in a couple weeks. You bet. Okay. Okay. I guess. Yeah. So, Kyle, I will start there. I think on the Waddell side, I think, we and Dan talked about our approach and thoughts on TA a little bit earlier. And I'd say, we have the same approach with Waddell. So there's really no different approach. They are making sure that we put those advisors in a position to successfully transition onto our platform. That's what transition assistance is for. And we will underwrite it in the same way. I think on the conference side of things and I will get a little color here, and Dan, if you want to jump in. But I think as we evolve over time, I think, like most folks we see on the other side of the pandemic doing a mix of continued virtual and digital things, but also, people value getting together in person. I think, especially in the independent advisory space, folks value getting together. So I likely see us having a mix of what we had pre-pandemic, but it's a little bit early to kind of call where and how those numbers start to change. So we will keep you updated a quarter ahead of time kind of how we gave -- how we did here today on promotional for next quarter. That's on a cost side. I don't know Dan if there is anything you want to add. Yeah. All right. We are all good there, Kyle. Yeah. Sure. Gerry, we didn't update it, but it's unchanged. So I think when we think about the next key dates, which are closing into the subsequent asset transfer. Our estimate for that is the middle of this year and then the integration, the on-boarding process, et cetera occurs after that and I think that will lead to an EBITDA benefit ramp of about 12 months after closing. So if you think we are closing and onboarding in the middle of this year, that will have us reach that run rate EBITDA estimate by the middle of next year or the middle of 2022. Yeah, so that's what was in that presentation and those estimates are the same today. Yeah. Chris, M&T and BMO are about half of that. There are large financial institutions where there is a bit more technology, a bit more on-boarding support, so that's why you see that increase. And well, I wouldn't call that one-time. I call it connected to on-boarding a large financial institution. So anytime we have those coming, you will see a little bit of a pickup in promotional for that, but it is, to your point, it's not recurring, it's just associated with those firms. And the rest of it's really -- there is a handful of things in there, but it's primarily tied to transition assistance amortization as we continue to recruit. That's right. That's right. They haven't joined yet. So that wouldn't have begun."

            "content": "Thank you, Carmel, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2020, our focus remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This is a credit to our employees who responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors. Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much-needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment.  As we enter the New Year, we remain focused on executing our strategy, while also evolving our long-term vision of how we deliver on our mission. We aspire to push past our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor-centered marketplace. Our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to use in constructing the perfect practice for themselves and their clients.  More specifically, this vision centers around making it easy for advisors to join our platform with no friction or complexity, and as simple as turning dials, they can determine the exact services they want to leverage, pick the business model that will work best for them, choose the technology and workflows that make them most efficient, and select the product mix that best meets the needs of their clients, all while leveraging expertise and solutions to enhance the performance of their businesses. Ultimately, that creates total empowerment for LPL advisors to thrive and that is the heart of our mission. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. With that context in mind, let's now turn to the fourth quarter and discuss our results and progress on our strategic plan. Let's start with our fourth quarter business results. Total assets reached a new high of over $900 billion, up 18% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets prior to acquisitions were a new high of $18 billion, which translated to an 8.8% annualized growth rate. For the full year, net new assets were $56 billion, which translates to a 7.4% annualized growth rate, up from 5.3% percent a year ago. This increase was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. In the fourth quarter, Recruited Assets remained solid at $10.8 billion, which brought our full-year total to $41 billion. This was up $6 billion from a year ago and by more than 50% over the past three years, primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and continued solid execution by our business development team. In the fourth quarter, we also continued to enhance the advisor experience, as we delivered solid service outcomes driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and technology and an enhanced service experience. As a result, retention remained approximately 98% for the year, up from 96.5% percent a year ago and Net Promoter Scores increased by over 15 points year-over-year and more than 60 points in three years. Our fourth quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes, with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, which brought our full-year total to $6.46.  Let's now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategic plan. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share. Now, in light of this we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us, not only to deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth but also to increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets while advisor movement remained at lower levels over the past year, we continued to drive solid recruiting results and gain market share. To share a little more color specifically on our third-party financial institutions channel, we continue to see good momentum in the core segment of this market, and at the same time, we remain encouraged by our opportunity with regional banks. The planning and preparation for our new relationships with BMO and M&T are going well and we are in ongoing strategic dialogues with other prospects. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we anticipate our new affiliation models will also contribute additional organic growth in 2021. Following five Strategic Wealth Services practices that onboarded last year, we have a solid pipeline with a number of commitments that will join in the first half of this year. In January, we also onboarded our first Independent employee model practice and we are seeing other prospects progress through the pipeline. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a strategic lever to complement organic growth. Earlier in Q4, we onboarded a combined $4 billion of assets from our acquisitions of Lucia and EK Riley, then in December, we signed an agreement to acquire Waddell & Reed's wealth management business, which has over 900 experienced and accomplished advisors, serving approximately $70 billion of client assets. Post the signing, our teams have collaborated well with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, which is contributing to solid progress on the transaction. Thus far in the process, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have already committed to join our platform following the close of the transaction. We will give you an update on the rest of the retention pipeline next quarter. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors, differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2021, we plan to continue our work from last year, with a focus on developing capabilities and solutions in two key areas. The first is to enrich the end client experience with expanded digital solutions, enhancements to our advisory platforms and a broader set of lending solutions. The second key area is using technology, including ClientWorks and ClientWorks Connected, to help advisors enhance the performance of their practices, operate more efficiently within their key workflows and expand scalability to serve more clients. We believe these evolving capabilities will contribute to an increase in advisor growth and retention rates. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients and that in turn helps drive advisor retention. One of the key parts of this strategic play is providing advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We are doing this by transforming our service model into a client care model. We are about halfway through the implementation of this model and at this point, it has made a solid contribution to our Net Promoter Scores. We see additional opportunity to drive these outcomes higher as we deliver the second half of this initiative. We also see evolving our custodial platform operations as an opportunity to further enhance service levels, platform scalability and efficiency. As part of this work, our areas of focus include automating routine work with robotics, removing paper forms and increasing eDelivery through digitization and process re-engineering to drive continuous improvement. We believe these initiatives combined with our transformation to a client care model position us to further strengthen the advisor experience and our platform as our business grows.  Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of Business Solutions. As a reminder, when we started Business Solutions over two years ago, we saw the opportunity to help advisors find better alternatives for some local services that cost in excess of $1 billion a year. Our hypothesis was that we could provide higher quality services at a lower cost and free up additional time, for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. In that spirit, we created our Business Solutions portfolio to solve for these discreet needs, with outsourced professional expertise. Since then, we have been able to expand and evolve the value proposition of the portfolio and scale our subscription base. As a result, we finished the fourth quarter with about 1,400 monthly subscriptions, which is more than double the level a year ago. At the same time, we have expanded the portfolio to include business optimizers and additional professional services. We are also innovating on how we package these solutions such that we can unlock additional value for advisors when using a combination of different offerings. As we look ahead, we see several pathways for continued growth including partnering with more of our LPL advisors, introducing new solutions, and experimenting with serving advisors outside of LPL. In Q1, we will launch the next innovation in our portfolio M&A Solutions, which will be our sixth offering. As context, this service grew out of CFO Solutions as we identified an opportunity to help advisors acquire other practices. That inspired us to develop M&A capabilities as a service for advisors. This M&A offering will provide a turnkey solution and dedicated support for advisors from deal sourcing all the way through transaction advice, capital funding and process execution. With this offering, advisors can now more easily use M&A as a repeatable and sustainable growth engine for their practices. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. Hi. Yes. Steven, so let me let me take a stab at that, and please, if I don't get it all, you ask a follow on? So, look, the short answer is, as we said in the remarks, we think that pace around 7% is sustainable. And then we continue to challenge ourselves to expand on that growth rate. So let me give you a little color as to how we think about that. I think one quick way to orient yourself to it is, how do we get to where we are over the last call it three years and that's been driven by new store sales increasing by 50% over that period of time, which has come almost totally out of our traditional markets. Retention rates have improved from 96% to 98% over that period of time. So that's also a helpful contribution. And then same-store sales continue kind of a steady, durable, increase over that period of time. And so what you have done is you have gone over that period of time from roughly below 3% organic growth rate to 7%. Now, as we look ahead, relative to the opportunity to both sustain, but more importantly, grow that rate, we look to new store sales first, and see the new markets that we have entered, the strategic wealth services model, the independent employee model and the RA markets, and obviously, see a much bigger opportunity set with momentum building inside those three new offerings, which largely haven't contributed a whole lot to our growth up to this point. So that that's one opportunity. Certainly this emerging new bank opportunity with respect to larger banks exploring outsourcing is a second way to think about an opportunity going forward. And then we continue to improve our own efficacy of our business development team and its capabilities to grow and win at higher rates. That's a third one as we continue to innovate there. And then, finally, I think we continue to innovate around onboarding and the more seamless we can make that we believe creates two more movement in the marketplace in the future. So those are how we think about opportunities and new store sales. I think it would be, if you click over the same-store sales for a minute, we see the opportunity to continue to drive automation into the advisors key workflows that then they get the benefits of efficiency, freeing up time to reallocate to more valuable activities. We also see this technology creating more scalability in their practices. So they can obviously attracted support more clients. We continue to build out new solutions for their organic growth efforts. And finally, this new M&A Solutions becomes yet another way for them to create another lever to grow their practices. So across new store and same-store says you have got multiple oars in the water that we are working on, in order to drive that rate higher. If we are successful on executing on these, well, then you can see where the logic around the opportunity set grows and we deliver higher growth rates. I hope that helps. Yeah. So, Bill, good question. I -- look, first of all, these Business Solutions are subscription based services, right? So that gives us flexibility as to how an advisor can plug in and leverage the LPL platform. So that's the premise where you have a bit more flexibility in this concept about being able to serve advisors outside of the LPL family, if you will. And today we are focused on continuing to innovate and deliver those services for LPL advisors. So that's where the majority of our allocation of investment goes across this strategic play. And that's allowing us to continue to learn and innovate on our offering. That said, our hypothesis is, these services could potentially be offered to all 300,000 financial advisors in the marketplace. If you think about that premise of, if I am operating my own business and I have local level services that are necessary to support the operation of that business. Well, then we believe we can step in and create higher quality solutions at a lower cost using automation and digital capabilities to create real interesting scalability. And you began to see where you could take for an example, take our M&A Solutions that we were just talking about and if we do that well for LPL advisors, then we could easily take that and point that to an advisor that doesn't necessarily sit on our platform today and help create growth opportunities associated with a practice by providing or plugging in to that type of solution. So that's the concept. Your right, call it, an experimental phase now. I think it's logical for us in our overall journey around this play to begin to experiment there and it's early days of that experiment. We will likely take one of these solutions and begin to explore how that might work and present itself outside of the of the LPL family of advisors. And that will allow us some learning that didn't apply and further innovate on how we might take this portfolio outside the LPL advisor base. I hope that helps. Yeah. Thanks, Bill. I will take the first part of that and Matt, you take the second. How about that? So, Bill, as you recall, we announced the transaction in early December and at that point we began our retention efforts associated with the Waddell & Reed advisors. And so we have been at that largely six weeks. And so what you are seeing is that 80% retention rate has more to do with just the timing and where we are in the overall process than anything else. As Matt said, we expect to close and convert in the second quarter. So there's still time left to have that ongoing dialogue and make sure that all advisors can make an informed choice around where that best option is for them. So think about that just as more where we are in the timing process than anything else. Matt, do you want to take the second part of that? Hey. Thank you. Yeah. Take that Matt and then I will add color around that. Yeah. More from an operational standpoint, we don't expect some big reallocation or shift in, how they are thinking about their portfolios or using what will then be Macquarie product on a go forward basis. So, I don't think you are going to see some big step function change in terms of the allocation of those assets. So I am not sure you see any then knock on effect from that, which is the second part of your question. Yeah. I think you are talking about our overall retention inside LPL. And look, I think, this is mainly just, you have seen it increase throughout the year, which is largely a matter of timing related to the impact the pandemic had in the early part of the year. So where might have been more complex or tougher inside that four-month to five-month period of real uncertainty. I think you just see now some of that pulling through. As we think about it and look at it over the full year, you have got 98% retention, and as I shared last quarter, we think about a good sustainable range being somewhere around 2% to 3% of attrition or said differently 97% to 98% retention. So that's what we are trying to manage to and work to and we feel good about the client experience and the advisor experience we are providing. And that is the primary driver of that attrition rate or retention rate and so that's kind of how we are managing to it and thinking about it. I hope that helps. I will take the first half of that and then Matt, I will turn it over to you. So, look, the short answer is, we are not seeing a lot of change in transition assistance rates this time. And you said it as a core principle for us, we determined transition assistance on a return basis approach and our TA rates have been stable over the last few quarters and as we enter this New Year, we don't see that changing. And when we look ahead, we think about TA and how it's currently positioned or transition assistance, along with the rest of our value proposition from capabilities, technology and service and believe that that's an overall really solid competitive offering and believe, as we go forward, that it will be a source of us continuing to gain market share. Do you want to talk about promotional expense? Yeah. Let me take that one and then, certainly, you can add anything to that. Look, it's a core component and value proposition of what we offer, both from a protection of -- to the firm, to the advisors, to the clients. But it's also a really important value proposition for us of taking complexity out of this business and simplifying it to enable the advisors to operate their businesses successfully. So it's a place that we have constantly have to innovate on regardless of our growth rates, but in a world where you are growing that just creates more opportunity to allocate resources to think about how you improve the efficacy and the efficiency of compliance and our overall risk management programs. And though we are not perfect and though we will try to play into that, I think, look, there's key components of our overall risk profile that we look at. There's some 16 different risk components that we actively monitor and review how we are doing in, in those areas. So think about that is managing your day-to-day risk or your operational risk. And then as a complement to that, there's that strategic opportunity that says, hey, how do we take and use robotics and artificial intelligence and automation of which to enrich the efficacy of our supervision, of our oversight? How do we imagine new ways of which to use technology to drive efficiency into what we do, which simply just then creates much more scalability to support that growth. And so we look at it through an operational lens and track that on a monthly basis and hold ourselves accountable to constantly iterating and learning and applying what we are doing well and or not to improve it and then we allocate resources to drive innovation to do it better. And look, our goal is to take risk management and turn it into an asset. If we continue to invest in it and we can do it better and cheaper than anyone else, it becomes a differentiator. And so that's how we think about our risk management programs and that's sort of what is our Northstar [ph], if you will, with respect to risk management. And if I added anything to that, I think, if click down on that, this is where you see that durable, but steady trend upward in same-store sales, where you are seeing advisors doing a really great job of serving and supporting their existing clients. So they are actually capturing assets from those existing clients at a higher rate than historically and certainly pre-pandemic. At the same time, we have seen them now return to capturing or acquiring new clients at the rates, they were pre-pandemic and so some of that dynamic underneath fourth quarter is certainly supportive of increasing growth rates both across the quarter, I am sorry, across the whole quarter and ramping up within the quarter. Matt, do you want to take that. Yeah. No. well said. Yeah. Hi. I will just give you a higher level macro overview at this point. I think we can give you more color as we move forward. But with respect to our RA offering, we currently provide this solution to a number of advisors. That said, we are investing in our capabilities and resources that we believe match that growing opportunity set. As we do expect over the next few years more advisor movement or churn across that space. And so we believe we can put together an interesting differentiated solution that will contribute to our ongoing organic growth and be a nice contribution to increasing that organic growth rate. So that's how we see that and where we are is continuing to make sure we have got that differentiated solution and that we have got the resources in place to take that to the market. So more color on that as we go forward throughout the year, but hopefully that gives you a sort of our jumping off-point. Yeah. Let me give you a little color on that, and again, I think, there is more to play out here as we go forward. So I can -- if I can answer anything -- everything today, I think, we can give you that color over the next couple of months. And so with respect to our M&A solutions, again what we are trying to solve for is actually helping advisors acquire other practices to integrate into their businesses, right? So that's the context, and quite frankly, we realized and recognized and working with our advisors, that many of them saw this as an opportunity, but saw the complexity associated with M&A really hard and it kept them out of exploring those opportunities. So our concept was, could we go create or build a solution that makes it much easier and simpler for them to go from point A to Z in that M&A process and thus in building a platform that helps them do that. If they do it once, then we are going to increase the odds, that they can do it again and again, you sort of create this repeatable, sustainable growth lever for them and a bit of a flywheel, if you think about it across a larger number of advisors. So that's the concept. And so what we have done over the last year is build that end-to-end platform for ourselves. So we will deliver that with LPL resources. So we have got a technology platform we have built that will host that and drive that and digitize that and make that easier. We obviously have access to the marketplace and will help facilitate that marketplace of buyers and sellers. We can give good transaction advice around that. We know this well and we know the models well. So we can provide advisor and we are positioned to do that and we can also provide the capital funding or an option to the advisor for their capital funding. So it's really delivered by us. We are not working with other advisory firms. And again, us doing it as a service, our opportunity is to certainly charge for the value that we are providing associated with managing through that process. But the real win for us is at the end of it is helping these advisors capture assets and grow on the platform. And so that's how we think about that. That's how you would see us pricing it associated with the more discounted fees for the value that we provide in the M&A process knowing that we can both help retain and grow organic assets on our platform. So I hope that helps you get the principles in the macro way we are thinking about it, more to come when we roll it out on pricing and things of that nature and that will happen in this quarter. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think, it's -- I mean when you -- maybe the book in to look at, right? If you look at the periods that we have got in our key metrics supplement, right? We -- you kind of bottomed out in the low 4% range and think of that as probably the max deployed in the market that we have seen and then the other extreme is, when you go back years and years ago when you have seen the max pullback is in the 9% to 10%. So it kind of feels like where we are right now at least with recent history, balances are a little bit high. I don't think it would surprise us if you get on the other side of a pandemic with vaccines out and whatever environment you would describe as the new normal. It wouldn't surprise us if that -- if you saw that 5.4% start to go back down as you see money go into the market. But I'd emphasize of course that's a really hard one to predict. But I think if -- when we look at the history that we have, that's probably what we would expect to see. Yeah. Remember DCA was a little bit challenging, because it's a fee-per-account, not a rate. So balances moving around can just change that reported rate, because it's a fee-per-account type fee. So I wouldn't read into that -- the move into that much. On the money market side, I think, you are just seeing the dynamic of interest rates being near zero and those products where the product manufacturers can waive fees that puts a little bit of pressure on the yields. But I don't think it's anything that you unexpected in an environment where Fed funds is in the 7, 8, 9 zone. I think that's what you expect to see on money funds. And of course emphasize, when you look at the balances, those are -- of our nearly $50 billion in client cash balances those are pretty small piece of the overall pie. Yeah. Thank you, Carmel. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great rest of your day."

Over the past quarter, our focus has remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This is a credit to our employees who have responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors. Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment. We believe this environment is driving several year\u2019s worth of change in just a matter of months. This pace of change is creating many new constraints and challenges to solve for throughout the industry. We see this change as an opportunity to create additional long-term value by enhancing how we serve our advisors, how our advisors take care of their clients and how we engage with and attract the best employee talent. We entered this year with momentum and the work we have done to operate in this changed environment puts us in an even stronger position to serve our advisors and grow our business going forward. Now looking ahead, we will continue to focus on investing in our platform, which helps our advisors win in the marketplace, attracts new advisors, and in turn, increases our scale and capacity to invest. This will help us deliver a market-leading platform that is the easiest place for the advisors to construct the perfect practice and run a thriving business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. With that context in mind, let\u2019s now turn to the third quarter and discuss how we are executing the key components of our business priorities while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Now let\u2019s start with how we are executing on our priorities is translating to business results. In the third quarter, our assets reached a new high of over $800 billion, driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. After consistently investing to deliver a leading advisory platform, our advisory assets continue to grow up 20% from a year ago and now are over 50% of our total assets. Moving to organic growth, net new assets remained solid at $11 billion, which translated to nearly a 6% annualized growth rate. This brought net new assets to a new high of $51 billion over the last 12 months, which translates to a 7% annualized growth rate and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. Organic growth increased throughout the quarter as expected. After the impact of client tax payments and summer seasonality in July and August, respectively, organic growth was over 7% in September, consistent with our growth rates in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, recruited assets were $10.7 billion and contributed to a new high of $41 billion over the past 12 months. These results were primarily driven by the appeal of our model and continued solid execution by our business development team. With respect to our advisor experience in the third quarter, we continued to develop solid service outcomes, driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities in technology and enhanced service experience. As a result, retention remained over 98% through the first three quarters of the year, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year ago. One of the traditional contributors to our advisor experience is our annual national conference. Now as we shared last quarter rather than cancel the event due to the environment, we pivoted our approach and in August delivered a digital experience. By moving the conference online, we enabled twice the number of people to participate this year, advisors found the content engaging and informative and appreciated the savings of both time and expense from not having to travel. That said, we continue to believe in the importance of in-person interaction as a personal connection is at the center of our industry. Given these learnings, we have the opportunity to structurally evolve how we deliver our conferences and leverage a mix of in-person and digital formats going forward. Our third quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44. Let\u2019s now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share. Now in light of this, we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. Our first strategic play, as a reminder, involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but also to increase our growth rate over time. With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to drive solid recruiting results, which include achieving higher win rates and attracting larger practices. This dynamic is also benefiting our pipeline, which expanded to new highs throughout the quarter. At the same time, we continue to increase our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. As a reminder, in July, we signed an agreement with M&T Bank to move its retail brokerage and advisory business to our platform. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with another leading institution, BMO Harris Bank. Their retail brokerage and advisory business, BMO Harris Financial Advisors plans to transition approximately $14 billion in assets and 115 financial advisors onto our platform in the first half of next year. We look forward to helping them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and grow their business. Together, these two leading banks are representative of the work we are doing to serve more large institutions. And with respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, our new affiliation models continue to gain traction. After launching our independent employee model this summer, we are seeing solid interest from prospective advisors and our pipeline is growing. We also added two more Strategic Wealth Services practices in the third quarter, which bring recruited assets on this model to approximately $1 billion. We are encouraged to see our new affiliation models building momentum and believe that they can help increase our organic growth rate over time. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate the marketplace and attract new advisors to our platform. Within this strategic play, we are focused on internally developing new capabilities, as well as opportunistically using M&A to accelerate the delivery of certain solutions. In that spirit, earlier this week, we acquired Blaze Portfolio, an advisory trading platform based in Chicago. As context, trading is a foundational piece of the advisor workflow and increasing its strategic value especially as more advisors shift to models-based practices. With the capabilities from Blaze, we will provide a more flexible and dynamic trading and rebalancing solution that enables advisors to deliver more personalized and engaging experience to their clients. Let\u2019s move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients. One of the key parts of this strategic play is transforming our service model into a client care model. As a reminder, this model is designed to provide advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them by bringing together an omnichannel platform, complex case management and self-help capabilities. After we rolled out our omnichannel and case management solutions across our service organization, they delivered a solid contribution to our advisor experience and NPS scores. We are now using speech analytics to monitor and learn from each service call to fine-tune our model and continue to increase performance and value over time. The next big category of work is self-help capabilities within client works, which will provide online, relevant and easy to navigate content that solves an advisor\u2019s needs without ever having to make a call. Our goal is to make self-help one of the easiest channels for advisors to access and navigate LPL, helping drive convenience and efficiency for their practices, while contributing to the ongoing enhancement of our advisor experience and NPS scores. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is Business Solutions. As we move through the changing environment this year, we have seen expanded utility of our original admin, marketing and CFO Solutions, as advisors leverage these offerings in different ways to solve for new challenges. The COVID-related climate also proved to be a catalyst for innovation and developing new services, like our Assurance Plan and Remote Office Solution. By continuing to learn and adapt to our advisors\u2019 changing needs, we now have a stronger and broader portfolio of solutions that are delivering more value, are applicable to more advisors and are proven across a challenging environment. As a result, our Business Solutions subscriptions have doubled over the past year to 1,200 at the end of the third quarter. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and to drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today\u2019s call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. We continue to drive strong organic growth, recently signed another large bank and closed on three acquisitions and we did all of these while remaining disciplined on expenses. As we look ahead, we are excited about our increasing opportunities to drive organic growth and long-term shareholder value. Now let\u2019s turn to our third quarter results, total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $810 million, up 6% from Q2, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $11.1 billion or a 5.8% annualized growth rate. Our results increased throughout the quarter with September organic growth at 7.4%, which was up from July and August as those two months included the impact from client tax payments and summer seasonality. Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth. We continued to produce strong results in the third quarter. Recruited assets were $10.7 billion in Q3, which brought our 12-month total to $40.8 billion. At the same time, retention remained over 98% year-to-date. Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $10.4 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate, which brought advisory assets to over 50% of our total. Centrally Managed platforms also continued to grow as net new assets were $1.9 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate. Now let\u2019s turn to our Q3 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $142 million, up $11 million from Q2, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and commissions. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $145 million in Q3, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased, driven by higher equity markets and organic growth. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $109 million, down $8 million from Q2, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $47 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. As for client cash yields, our Q3 ICA yield was 118 basis points, down 9 basis points from Q2. The decrease was primarily driven by lower LIBOR rates, as well as $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q4, we will have the full quarter impact of the decline in LIBOR that occurred in Q3, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q3, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decrease by about 10 basis points sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues, they were $120 million flat sequentially, driven by higher fee revenue and lower trade. While July and August trading returned to more normalized levels, volumes increased in September along with market volatility. Looking ahead to Q4, I would highlight that our October volumes have returned to more normalized levels. Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,200 subscriptions at the end of Q3. This is up 250 from last quarter and double our total from a year ago. These offerings generate roughly $15 million of annual recurring gross profit, and more importantly, they help advisors free up additional time to serve their clients and grow their business. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses starting with Core G&A. It was $227 million in Q3, up $5 million sequentially, as we continue to invest to drive organic growth across our new affiliation models, technology and service. Looking ahead to Q4, we remain on track to be in the lower half of our 2020 Core G&A outlook range of $915 million to $940 million. Moving on to promotional expenses, they were $58 million in Q3, up $13 million sequentially, primarily driven by our national advisor conference. Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate lower conference expense, partially offset by seasonal marketing and continued growth in recruiting transition assistance. As a result, we expect Q4 promotional expense to decrease by about $5 million from Q3. Turning to our tax rate, it was 23% in Q3. This is below our expected range of 27% to 29%, as we benefited from a positive decision on a prior expense that was considered non-deductible. Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q3, with credit agreement net leverage at 2.15 times and cash available for corporate use of $252 million. The strength of our balance sheet remains a key enabler of organic growth and positions us to deploy capital when opportunities arise. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. As we look forward, we see increasing opportunities to allocate capital to organic growth and M&A, including transition assistance for M&T and BMO next year. Given these opportunities, we are currently prioritizing capital deployment to organic growth and M&A. That said, we will stay flexible and we will adjust our plans as the opportunity set evolves, including allocating capital to share repurchases. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q3, and as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Good evening, everybody. So, Dan, maybe I want start with your big picture, obviously, you detailed three or four things that are really resonating in the marketplace. Could you unpack maybe the organic growth that you are seeing, maybe take it down a little bit to the different channels between sort of the traditional channels versus new one and so maybe speak to what\u2019s particularly resonating in the marketplace that\u2019s driving the very strong both net new assets, as well as the recruited assets?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Let me take a stab at that and I will try to give you a little color and then if you have got a follow-on, please fire away. So look, I think, if you think about our growth. We, first and foremost look across all of the different models or parts of the market that we serve and look at how we are doing from new store sales, same-store sales and retention, right? And if you match that to the investments that we make strategically in our model, they are meant to serve or support any parts of that growth formula. So we obviously see record high results in the new store sales, which is referenced in the trailing 12-month recruiting that we have done, where we have brought in over $40 billion in assets, which was a record high for us, so that would reinforce that oar in the water is making good progress. I will come back to that. I think same-store sales has been durable and kind of sustained itself in a similar place over the last couple of years. This year, more of that opportunity is coming from advisors broadening their value to existing clients and ultimately getting rewarded for that value by gathering more assets with those existing clients, which is a bit of a different shift from prior years where they may get a higher mix of that growth from new clients that they attract. And then on the retention front, clearly, that\u2019s us investing in our model, improving and enhancing the service experience, the technology capabilities, our ability to serve and support and evolve the model going forward and sort of play out into the future where our advisor\u2019s needs are. And I think that is best reflected in the retention rate, which is up 200 basis points over the last couple of years. So I think that gives you a feel, if you will, around the different horse that we have in the water and the contribution they are making to that. So I think we are getting a good contribution across the Board with the most significant coming in the growing of the -- of new store sales or recruiting. And if I click down on the markets based on your question, most of that recruiting results over the last 12 months has come from our traditional markets, so think about our traditional independent and the institutions marketplace. We have got the three new models or markets that we are ramping in, SWS is the first one that you are beginning to see some contribution now come from that and the pipeline there is sound. More importantly, we are moving people through that pipeline and I think you will begin to see a bigger contribution of that in 2021 from the SWS model, our Strategic Wealth Services model. Then you also have our employee-based model or Linsco model, as we have branded it and that is just new to the marketplace. It\u2019s getting a really positive reception. I think for some of the differentiated capabilities, we are building that pipeline. We think that solution is appealing to an interesting segment of the marketplace, and so, again, I think, we are quite bullish on the contribution that can come from that in the future and none of the growth has come from that model up to this point. And then finally, the RIA only, we are an RIA custodian or we support some RIAs. We are going in and investing in that model and evolving it, such that we think it\u2019s going to create a really interesting, compelling solution that\u2019s differentiated in the marketplace at a time where we expect to see some churn pick up in that part of the marketplace. So that\u2019s a little bit of how we think about the contribution up to this point with those models, but then how you might think about them differently as we go forward. I hope that helps.\nBill Katz: That\u2019s helpful. It is. Thank you. Maybe one for Matt. Just sort of thinking about your commentary where you ended in terms of capital priorities. Just stepping back as you think about core expense growth as you look out to next year? How much of an opportunity has that been down the underlying expense growth just given everything that\u2019s been going on with COVID and work-from-home and remote office backdrop versus maybe not letting that bend down and reinvesting back in business to further turbo charge organic growth?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Hey, Bill. So I think as we think about expenses next year, we will share our plans on the next quarter\u2019s call. But I think from a principal standpoint, I think you hit on it in your question. When I think about Core G&A and spending, it\u2019s really back to the capital allocation priorities. I think we see the highest and best use of capital to invest and drive organic growth. I think that will be the principle that we bring to that and that will be the principle we will bring to laying on our Core G&A plans for next year.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting off with a strategic question for Dan. Some of the acquisitions, including AdvisoryWorld and more recently Blaze, there are products or services which are being marketed to advisors outside of the LPL channel. And as your strategy evolves and you continue to build out just some of the more proprietary Business Solutions, especially given some of the strong demand for those services you have seen from your own advisors. How are you thinking about the opportunity to maybe white-label and market some of those solutions outside of your current advisor network, especially given some of the wealth competitors within that solution space trade at much higher valuation multiples?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Steven, it\u2019s Dan. Hey. Good question. Look, with respect to Blaze and AdvisoryWorld, those are both part of our strategy where we use M&A, in some cases to help accelerate the development of our capabilities and then fully integrating those capabilities into our overall ecosystem or workflows for our advisors. And in this case, that\u2019s very much what we are doing here is capitalizing on a really good solution in property out in the marketplace and bringing it into improve and enhance the overall workflow associated with portfolio construction and development, right, and trading is a big component of that. That said, the second opportunity associated with this acquisition is certainly to continue to support the market share that they have outside of the LPL platform and that is our intent to do that here. It\u2019s to continue to serve and support it, continue to invest and innovate in the capability and tool and certainly evolve that offering to those clients. I think by doing that, it gives us the chance to continue to learn and understand how to serve a marketplace outside of the LPL platform, which then strategically positions us and reserves the right to if we ever want to shift or pivot and begin to serve that third-party marketplace in a more significant way. I think it gives us the foundation to work from and do that well. So though not the priority right now, it certainly is a strategic element of value here that gives us the chance to learn and allows us to be positioned to do that.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for those remarks, Dan. And maybe just a clarifying question, a follow-up to Bill\u2019s earlier one on organic growth and investment. Matt, I know your investments in recent quarters have been largely focused on driving organic growth, we saw strong momentum in September. I was hoping you can just give us some more color on whether that organic growth momentum has continued into October? And what that can mean for just Core G&A expense in Q4 as we contemplate some of those additional investments?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Sure, Steven. We look at what we have seen so far in October, right, being here pretty much at the end of the month. That momentum has continued. So I\u2019d describe it as consistent with September. I would keep in mind the majority of advisory fees are charged and paid in the first month of the quarter. So when you look at the trends from September to October, that\u2019s going to have a natural bias down just from the change in the amount of fees. Putting that aside, October M&A is really trending at a similar level to September, so we have seen that return to organic growth continue. And then on the cash balance side or the cash sweep side, we have continued to see cash build in October at a modest pace. I think we are seeing some good results there. On the Core G&A side to your point, we remain on track for that lower half of our outlook range. So that lower half being, call it, $915 million to around $927 million. I think to the point of your question, where we would land in that range especially with three quarters being completed and just one left. I think the main variable is the variable expense associated with organic growth and how we finish the year. So given the first three quarters, as well as what we have seen so far in October, I\u2019d say, we are probably going to be towards the upper end of that range, meaning the $915 million to $927 million range. But we do have two more months to go, so we will have to see how it plays out, but that would be the perspective where we are today. \nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great, Matt. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Hi, everybody. So I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the banking channel. You guys announced two sizable deals in the last couple of months. So maybe talk a little bit about what\u2019s changed in that channel that makes you guys more of an attractive place for some of these advisors to join? And then from a financial perspective, maybe you could just kind of walk us through sort of a framework around gross profit ROA and EBITDA ROA for those type of transactions, including amortization of transition assistance that, Matt, I think, you alluded to that in your earlier comments that that\u2019s probably going to pick up next year, some of those FAs on Board?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So, Alex, it\u2019s Dan. Let me take the first half of that and then I will let Matt finish up with sort of part B of that. So, look, with respect to the general financial institutions marketplace. We have seen some good solid momentum over the last couple of years, and as you all know, it\u2019s roughly a $1 trillion asset marketplace, and roughly a third of that business is outsourced today. So last year, we recruited $5 billion, which mainly would have been share that\u2019s coming from what was already outsourced. This year we are on track to double those results, and again, it\u2019s mainly where there are participants that are already outsourcing that solution or service. I think strategically, we challenged ourselves around this concept of can we add value to a part of the marketplace that traditionally hasn\u2019t outsourced, and if so, how might you do that, in this case, it\u2019s these larger financial institutions. And so I think what we have done is try to go in and innovate or ensure that we could deliver for them a differentiated client experience, which we know is important in their overall offering out in the marketplace and how they position themselves and if we can complement that and extend that overall value proposition in a differentiated way, that\u2019s interesting. If we can find ways of which to optimize the financial contribution of this type of business line within the financial institutions would be a second place that we focused on. And finally, ultimately, shifting the risk profile for them, I think, is typically an appealing characteristic of the model. And so those are the areas that we focused on to try to come up with innovative ways of which to shift that, evolve that, such that this market that had never been outsourced became an opportunity and that\u2019s where we focused. And try to show up with a differentiated solution and have had the opportunity to have that dialogue with some of these financial institutions. We think it\u2019s pretty appealing. It\u2019s a pretty unique model and I think we have got a couple of wins and we are out there actively sharing that concept in that model. Though not for everyone, we think it\u2019s pretty appealing, so that\u2019s the concept we have used to try to extend the market, if you will, in this channel. I hope that answers your question.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. And, Alex, on the financial side. When you look at the traditional bank channel, usually the majority of the assets at those institutions are on the brokerage side. So you kind of start and look at our gross profit ROA and those assets are in the 15-basis-point to 20-basis-point range and then for the larger banks, given their size, the returns are usually at the lower end of that range. So that\u2019s the way to think about gross profit. On the cost side, I think one of the primary benefits of the transaction is we can really bring our scale to serve them in an efficient way. So there\u2019s really a lower cost to serve. And then on the transition assistance side, we always underwrite to returns, so given those dynamics that the TA rates are typically lower for those banks -- for those larger banks. So when you put all that together, the economics are accretive on the EBITDA margin for us, and then, I think on these two specific ones, as we get closer in future quarters, we will give you a little bit of color on to the extent on how their onboarding and things will impact the financials in those periods.\nAlex Blostein: Awesome. Thanks. And my follow-up, I guess it qualifies as a follow-up, is around M&A broadly. I am just curious to get your thoughts that in case we do have a change in tax law and there\u2019s a change in capital gain taxes. To what extent do you think that could be a driver in increased consolidation in the industry with you as an acquirer potentially or some of your financial advisors acquiring other practices with kind of financial backing of LPL, because I know, obviously, that\u2019s an interesting element to the story that you guys bring to the financial advisor, just kind of allowing them to use your sort of balance sheet for acquisitions?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. I think the fundamental point, Alex, which is a good one that you are making is, where there\u2019s change, there\u2019s usually a broad set of different questions or new needs that come up or people contemplate new scenarios that they may not have faced before. And we do think the environment, as we look out for any number of reasons, including potential tax law changes, certainly drives more consolidation and activity on the M&A front and whether that be at the advisor level, which is a logical place to ask that question or more at the corporate level. I think we see that landscape being -- and the trajectory of the activity, they are trending up on both fronts. And obviously, as we have said, from a strategic standpoint, we would typically be a participant on both of those levels as we have in the past couple of years and we would take our disciplined approach where we make sure that these acquisitions make sense from a strategic standpoint, a financial one and operationally. But I think we are aligned in the premise of your question that you are going to see more activity.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good evening, everyone, and hope you are all doing well. I wanted to follow-up on NNAs. So 3Q was impacted by taxes and seasonality, and then next year you have two NNA accretive transactions closing. So can you comment on your ability to accelerate off this 6% level into 2021?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for the question. And let me take a first run at that and you fill in anything, Matt, that you think would be helpful. So I think if you look at Q3 as a jumping off point where you had roughly a 6% annualized growth rate. That was driven by, certainly, July as you say, with the tax payment trends and that will pop up next year in April rather than in July, let\u2019s hope. But I think you will certainly see that headwind in that particular month that the tax payments occurs and then there\u2019s always a little seasonality in the summer. But let\u2019s just say that 6% to 7% is the right more blended jumping off rate. I think as we look out and push ourselves or challenge ourselves to drive that number forward or higher outside of the $34 billion that comes from the two large financial institutions that we referred to. I think we see us continuing to invest in our model that makes it more appealing, improve the effectiveness of our own sales activities and business development activities. Our traditional markets continue to contribute to that -- to a higher growth rate in terms of new recruiting. I think our new markets, as you supplement them then. They begin to contribute because, as I said up to this point, we have had very little contribution from them. So we see that as an opportunity as they ramp in more robustly next year. So those are both places where we would challenge ourselves to continue to extend the growth rate especially as the new store sales. We continue to invest in the model from a service experience standpoint and we have got retention levels at the 98% level now. We think that\u2019s a pretty sound and solid outcome. So I think as we go forward and continue to invest in that service experience, that\u2019s probably a good way to think about retention. And then I think same-store sales is a place that we continue to believe there\u2019s more opportunity there and we continue to innovate, especially inside Business Solutions with a new offering called Growth Solutions that is in the experimental phase right now, where we are being more explicit and coming up with new ways of which to help advisors grow their existing businesses and so though I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a short run opportunity, we do see that as a long-term opportunity to tease out more contribution in same-store sales. So I hope that helps you as we think about at least going into next year, where that ramp would come is probably new store sales and longer term you probably get it from new store and same-store.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Dan. Very comprehensive. I have one follow-up P&L question probably for, Matt, but I just wanted your perspective on the 25% increase year-over-year in transition assistance versus, I think, it was a 4% increase in net new advisors?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Sure, Craig. I mean I think that the approach on TA is really the same, right? It\u2019s underwritten to returns and those returns based on the assets that come over and I think what you are starting to see not just this year, but over the past several years us starting to recruit larger and larger advisors, and the return hurdles haven\u2019t changed. So I think any dynamic you are seeing there is just related to us being able to bring on more advisors from more assets.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on the Centrally Managed assets and platform there. It looks like that\u2019s stabilized here at around 14.5% of client assets. So I just hope you could talk a little bit more about some of the initiatives that you are putting in place when thinking about to further accelerate the penetration. How is the product set evolving and if you could also touch upon maybe and describe the profile of the type of advisors that are participating on the Centrally Managed platform?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. So let me take some of those and get, if I miss one or two of the different sub-questions in there, please just redirect me. But -- and so look, we believe that this models based approach or models management based approach that\u2019s emerging inside advisor\u2019s practices is a significant and sustainable trend. It\u2019s a really good way for them to optimize portfolio construction in a really efficient way and construction/management. And it applies both as rep as PM all the way over to your Centrally Managed platforms. And so we see the opportunity to make investments in this models based approach being relevant across that entire advisory platform. That said, if you go move over to the Centrally Managed concepts, I think, where we are trying to make investments and where we actually believe we can continue to drive growth and participation on those platforms, continuing to add, what I might call, variations to them. So you heard us talk a lot about rep sleeve, which is an ability to use Centrally Managed platform and just outsource less than the turnkey option or alternative and that extends the applicability now of that model to more advisors as an example. We continue to make other investments in that platform and pull in other underlying securities. So you pull in individual equities, you pull in SMAs and now you are beginning to enrich that overall Centrally Managed platform and you are going to have a lot more advisors utilize it for a variety of different reasons for their clients. So think about variations to the Centrally Managed solution and also think about extending the overlying strategies that you can apply to it and the different securities that you could use within it. So there\u2019s lots of ripe opportunity there to continue to invest in our platform to extend its applicability to a lot more advisors and help us drive more assets there or contribute more assets. I think, also, as you know, we make investments from a pricing standpoint typically each year. And we have tended to focus on advisory and we will continue to do that as we move forward, our advisory platforms and this would be an area where, again, you lower minimums, you simplify pricing, you lower pricing on your Centrally Managed platforms, you are going to draw more utilization of them there too. So that\u2019s sort of the spectrum of how we think about the opportunity to enrich its appeal to the advisors and ultimately how they use it to serve their clients.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Maybe just the last part of that question just around the profile of advisors that are more likely to participate or that are participating today, just any color there that you can share?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. I think a couple of thoughts there. It\u2019s actually a broad appeal across the Board. So there\u2019s not one segment that we built it for. It\u2019s meant to have broad application across the platform. I think as more advisors are using more advisory solutions in their overall mix, that just overarching demand will tease out the opportunity for more to test, experiment and use it. We see them using it across a client size now. That typically ranges somewhere from $100,000 to $0.25 million in assets and that\u2019s not to say it was built that way, but that tends to today fill a sweet spot in perhaps how it\u2019s used. I think we continue to work on the pricing. You will enable it to be used up market. And I also think you see advisors who have traditionally been rep as PM or had done the portfolio construction and management themselves. As their time is pressured in general or they want to allocate it to other higher value services, you are seeing more and more experiment with shifting some of that traditional rep as PM work over to Centrally Managed model. So making it easy to convert from one model to the other, putting them all inside one platform under one contract takes out the friction associated with that transition or that movement and as we do that over the next year or so, we also think that will unlock some movement towards these Centrally Managed solutions.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nChris Harris: Yeah. Great. A question on the ICA guide for Q4, has the yield on floating balances changed much at all and I asked the question because it seems like a decent step down for just $0.5 billion of fixed that are rolling off?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Chris, I think, the -- on the variable balances, it\u2019s really just the contracts associated with LIBOR, resetting and coming down to where current LIBOR is. Fed funds obviously moved pretty immediately back in March and LIBOR has just moved slowly after that. I think where it sits today, if history is a guide, it\u2019s now settled in where it would typically be when Fed funds is near zero, but it\u2019s just those contracts resetting.\nChris Harris: Okay. And subsequent to quarter end, there was a move up in some medium-term, long-term interest rates. At what level of rate do you guys need to see where you might entertain the idea of moving potentially some more balances into fixed?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I mean our focus on fixed is unchanged, right, targeting that 50% to 75% zone of the overall balances and really to minimize the amount of impact on our economics as interest rates move. I think what\u2019s most relevant today is less about where the curve is and really just the amount of liquidity in the marketplace. I mean there\u2019s just not a lot of demand for those fixed rate contracts. So I think minor movements in the curve probably don\u2019t change that. I think over the long term, if the curve steepens, I think, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity economically for us to move more into fixed rate balances. You just look at where we are today at about 35% fixed. If you just look at the bottom end of that target range moving up to 50%, it\u2019s about $5 billion in balances that we can move. And I think if you look back over the last couple of years when we were moving into the fixed rate market, the sweet spot in that market was really the five-year point on the curve. So if you are just trying to run some math, I think, thinking about the opportunity at the low end of the range of $5 billion on the five-year point of the curve is the opportunity. But I think in the moment right now, there\u2019s just so much liquidity in the market, there\u2019s just not a lot of opportunity today.\nChris Harris: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just a couple of follow-ups, one, just on Business Solutions, the subscriptions up 250 quarter-over-quarter, just wondering if you can give more color as to which solutions are seeing the most uptake? And then just maybe qualitatively, if you could talk a bit about how the solutions are resonating as part of the value proposition when you are actually pitching the advisors for some of your new channels?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. It\u2019s Dan. Let me try to swing at that. So maybe the second one first, I think, so first of all, this concept about helping an advisor run and optimize how they operate their business. There\u2019s new capabilities there that the independent space hasn\u2019t always been focused on solving for. And I think our principle was make sure that we build something that is digital in nature so you can scale it and personalize it but also make sure it has the ability to help the business owner or advisor execute versus just sort of sharing more best practices with them. So the concept was to fix an execution challenge not a know-how or a knowledge challenge. And so in that spirit, that continues to be our focus with respect to all of these solutions and that\u2019s what resonates regardless of the model. The traditional independent model, typically the independent has experienced where some of those challenges or friction points are. And when they get the leverage of an admin or a CFO that can provide, in the case of an admin, just leverage points of time where there\u2019s task to do that are better outsourced to someone where they can focus and allocate that time to higher value tasks. The CFO, though, provides them real knowledge and insight that they may not have had or had the luxury of leveraging to help them enrich their decision making. So it resonates for the independent who has actually already experienced the friction. It resonates with the Strategic Wealth Services, because that\u2019s an advisor that\u2019s coming out of an employee model that is curious about and a little apprehensive about running a business and these services being available to them is a great leverage point and a boost to confidence in being able to do that. So those are two examples of where a new model that resonates and on an independent model, same value but one\u2019s got a different experience, but it resonates with them and I think you are seeing equal appeal, as we describe those services in any of those models. I think what we have had to do, remember, we are still really in a phase of innovation and iteration and so we are constantly learning how to tweak, how to evolve, how to add capabilities, elements or prioritize those in these services. And so this year has been a great learning opportunity for us to take the traditional admin, CFO and marketing solutions and evolve their utility or listen to what our client\u2019s needs through a different environment, in a tough environment and really enrich the value associated with those solutions such that they broaden the appeal to more advisors. The other thing we are thinking about doing is how do we continue to lower the cost, lower the price point and again extend the appeal to more advisors. So those are the things that we are doing inside Business Solutions to drive, we think increased adaptability and leverage of those solutions. What\u2019s growing the fastest? We have seen good consistent growth across the traditional three, admin, CFO, CMO. We were actually concerned inside the pandemic that people would be concerned about paying for them and maybe you would see attrition pickup and we saw the opposite, people really get great value out of these solutions during it. It actually reinforce their durability and their value, and again, as we said, we extended their versatility or their utility to these clients. And so though I think it did hurt selling to new advisors in the short run because of the environment. We think the value proposition is reinforced and we have seen growth rates begin to pick up post that the sort of the height of the pandemic. I think the two new solutions that we mentioned, especially the Assurance Plan, have been the biggest drivers of growth in the last quarter. The Assurance Plan really resonates when you think about helping someone protect their business in the event of an untimely or unplanned impact to their lives and it creates a really interesting way of which to preserve the asset that they have created in their business and create an orderly way of which to ensure that it protects that asset for their family and for those end clients of it and make sure for an orderly transition at a reasonable market based valuation. So that has been very attractive, because that gap out in the marketplace did not exist, especially for advisors who are in their 40s and 50s and have a longer runway left to operate their businesses. It\u2019s an extremely attractive value.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks, Dan. Maybe a follow-up for Matt on capital return. I think the last two quarters, you mentioned or you stated that the buyback was paused, I don\u2019t think I caught that exact phrase in this quarter. But just wondering if we should take that to mean that you are more comfortable restarting some level of buyback, even though you are prioritizing that capital towards organic growth and M&A?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I mean, I think, maybe if I bridge us from the beginning of the year, where we were buying back shares in Q1 and pretty consistently in 2019 as well. I think that pause in March was really driven by the macro uncertainty from COVID. And while we continue to monitor the macro, I think, as you heard well in the prepared remarks, the business has really strengthened. So I think all else equal, we likely would have restarted share repurchases by now. But those opportunities in organic growth and M&A have just increased and that\u2019s really where we are deploying the capital, right? Organic growth driving the highest levels in our history, we talked a fair bit about M&T and BMO onboarding next year, where just those two firms alone are $34 billion of AUM and we closed on three M&A deals in as many months in the last three months. So I think you heard right, share repurchases are attractive, but the opportunities that we are focused on right now are on organic growth and M&A. And if that changes, we will adjust consistent with our priorities and that includes allocating capital to share repurchases.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Maybe just one for me on competitive dynamics, but broker recruitment obviously has been strong throughout the pandemic and if historical trends I guess are something to look too there, we might expect sort of a pickup in broker recruitment on the other side of this. So just sort of curious to see or hear, based on conversations, is there kind of a cohort of advisors that\u2019s waiting to kind of get to the other side before engaging with folks, such as yourselves, or perhaps, has this been a different environment, whereby you have been able to kind of just consistently go out and attract advisors despite the uneven backdrop? Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Good question. Certainly, this environment, we have seen movement of advisors are churned as we call it down. As you look over the last nine months, 10 months, churn rates are down but our win rates are up. So the team has done a great job of persevering through some of the complexities created by the environment and I think you have continued to share the story and helped advisors find creative ways of which to still make that transition. We expect that creativity in that approach and sort of that resilient heads down. Keep moving forward approach to be taken by our team as we move forward. We do believe that as you get to the other side of the pandemic that it\u2019s reasonable to expect churn rates to trend up and with the additional models we have, applying them across multiple markets where the churn rate comes up, we think about that as an interesting opportunity. So I think your premise is correct.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my question, Dan.\nDan Arnold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nWill Cuddy: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken.\nDan Arnold: Hi, Will.\nWill Cuddy: So production revenue -- hi. Production revenue has been elevated this year and while still elevated in 3Q, it\u2019s been trending a little lower from the first half of the year. If my math is right, slide four of the deck implies a 97% retention rate of production, down from 98.5% for the first half of the year and it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s seasonality in prior years. Why do you think production has trended down in 3Q, and looking ahead, do you expect this to continue down and stabilize around a more normal level of 96%, stabilize at current levels or increase back to levels seen in the first half of the year?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. So let me take that one. I think to maybe come back to your final point and question. We think somewhere in that 2% to 3% range is what we are trying to play to and we think that\u2019s a reasonable landing place for attrition, so conversely 97% to 98% of retention. I think you had, in the first part of the year, some benefit or tailwind, if you will, around retention, just because of the pandemic and what we said earlier, lower churn in the overall marketplace kind of showed up there, maybe with a little bit of help. But, I think, again, the growing appeal of the model, the capability set that we are trying to invest in, the service experience we can deliver is really the drivers of that retention rate and we think a reasonable place is that 97% to 98% range.\nWill Cuddy: Got it. Thanks, Dan. And then on transaction fee revenue, Matt, thanks for the commentary in the prepared remarks on trading volumes. To help us understand the dynamics a little bit better, could you roughly break out how much of that revenue line is transaction and how much of that is fee? And then as we think about the growth of your Business Solutions and subscriptions, like how can that growth drive that revenue line item further, how are we going to see that on the P&L?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I mean the majority of that line is fees. So call it two-thirds, the three-fourth zone is fees. So transactions is a much smaller piece of it, so to answer your first question. On the Business Solutions side, it\u2019s -- right now the run rate gross profit is around $15 million for the solutions that we have so far, and I think, obviously, we expect to grow that from there. And maybe just to emphasize Dan\u2019s color a little bit earlier, we are still in the experimental phase on some of them and learning and growing from here. But I think we feel quite good about growth over the long-term. And perhaps more importantly, they are about setting up advisors for them to be able to manage their businesses and grow their balance sheets, if you will or AUM, as well as operate a more efficient practice. I think if we do that, you are going to see that show up across the P&L. I think that\u2019s really where the long-term success can come from as well.\nWill Cuddy: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for any closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day and please stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. We continue to drive strong organic growth, recently signed another large bank and closed on three acquisitions and we did all of these while remaining disciplined on expenses. As we look ahead, we are excited about our increasing opportunities to drive organic growth and long-term shareholder value. Now let's turn to our third quarter results, total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $810 million, up 6% from Q2, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $11.1 billion or a 5.8% annualized growth rate. Our results increased throughout the quarter with September organic growth at 7.4%, which was up from July and August as those two months included the impact from client tax payments and summer seasonality. Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth. We continued to produce strong results in the third quarter. Recruited assets were $10.7 billion in Q3, which brought our 12-month total to $40.8 billion. At the same time, retention remained over 98% year-to-date. Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $10.4 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate, which brought advisory assets to over 50% of our total. Centrally Managed platforms also continued to grow as net new assets were $1.9 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate. Now let's turn to our Q3 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $142 million, up $11 million from Q2, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and commissions. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $145 million in Q3, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased, driven by higher equity markets and organic growth. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $109 million, down $8 million from Q2, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $47 billion, up $1 billion sequentially. As for client cash yields, our Q3 ICA yield was 118 basis points, down 9 basis points from Q2. The decrease was primarily driven by lower LIBOR rates, as well as $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q4, we will have the full quarter impact of the decline in LIBOR that occurred in Q3, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q3, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decrease by about 10 basis points sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues, they were $120 million flat sequentially, driven by higher fee revenue and lower trade. While July and August trading returned to more normalized levels, volumes increased in September along with market volatility. Looking ahead to Q4, I would highlight that our October volumes have returned to more normalized levels. Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,200 subscriptions at the end of Q3. This is up 250 from last quarter and double our total from a year ago. These offerings generate roughly $15 million of annual recurring gross profit, and more importantly, they help advisors free up additional time to serve their clients and grow their business. Now let's turn to expenses starting with Core G&A. It was $227 million in Q3, up $5 million sequentially, as we continue to invest to drive organic growth across our new affiliation models, technology and service. Looking ahead to Q4, we remain on track to be in the lower half of our 2020 Core G&A outlook range of $915 million to $940 million. Moving on to promotional expenses, they were $58 million in Q3, up $13 million sequentially, primarily driven by our national advisor conference. Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate lower conference expense, partially offset by seasonal marketing and continued growth in recruiting transition assistance. As a result, we expect Q4 promotional expense to decrease by about $5 million from Q3. Turning to our tax rate, it was 23% in Q3. This is below our expected range of 27% to 29%, as we benefited from a positive decision on a prior expense that was considered non-deductible. Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q3, with credit agreement net leverage at 2.15 times and cash available for corporate use of $252 million. The strength of our balance sheet remains a key enabler of organic growth and positions us to deploy capital when opportunities arise. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. As we look forward, we see increasing opportunities to allocate capital to organic growth and M&A, including transition assistance for M&T and BMO next year. Given these opportunities, we are currently prioritizing capital deployment to organic growth and M&A. That said, we will stay flexible and we will adjust our plans as the opportunity set evolves, including allocating capital to share repurchases. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q3, and as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, Operator, please open the call for questions. Yeah. Hey, Bill. So I think as we think about expenses next year, we will share our plans on the next quarter's call. But I think from a principal standpoint, I think you hit on it in your question. When I think about Core G&A and spending, it's really back to the capital allocation priorities. I think we see the highest and best use of capital to invest and drive organic growth. I think that will be the principle that we bring to that and that will be the principle we will bring to laying on our Core G&A plans for next year. Yeah. Sure, Steven. We look at what we have seen so far in October, right, being here pretty much at the end of the month. That momentum has continued. So I'd describe it as consistent with September. I would keep in mind the majority of advisory fees are charged and paid in the first month of the quarter. So when you look at the trends from September to October, that's going to have a natural bias down just from the change in the amount of fees. Putting that aside, October M&A is really trending at a similar level to September, so we have seen that return to organic growth continue. And then on the cash balance side or the cash sweep side, we have continued to see cash build in October at a modest pace. I think we are seeing some good results there. On the Core G&A side to your point, we remain on track for that lower half of our outlook range. So that lower half being, call it, $915 million to around $927 million. I think to the point of your question, where we would land in that range especially with three quarters being completed and just one left. I think the main variable is the variable expense associated with organic growth and how we finish the year. So given the first three quarters, as well as what we have seen so far in October, I'd say, we are probably going to be towards the upper end of that range, meaning the $915 million to $927 million range. But we do have two more months to go, so we will have to see how it plays out, but that would be the perspective where we are today. Yeah. And, Alex, on the financial side. When you look at the traditional bank channel, usually the majority of the assets at those institutions are on the brokerage side. So you kind of start and look at our gross profit ROA and those assets are in the 15-basis-point to 20-basis-point range and then for the larger banks, given their size, the returns are usually at the lower end of that range. So that's the way to think about gross profit. On the cost side, I think one of the primary benefits of the transaction is we can really bring our scale to serve them in an efficient way. So there's really a lower cost to serve. And then on the transition assistance side, we always underwrite to returns, so given those dynamics that the TA rates are typically lower for those banks -- for those larger banks. So when you put all that together, the economics are accretive on the EBITDA margin for us, and then, I think on these two specific ones, as we get closer in future quarters, we will give you a little bit of color on to the extent on how their onboarding and things will impact the financials in those periods. Yeah. Sure, Craig. I mean I think that the approach on TA is really the same, right? It's underwritten to returns and those returns based on the assets that come over and I think what you are starting to see not just this year, but over the past several years us starting to recruit larger and larger advisors, and the return hurdles haven't changed. So I think any dynamic you are seeing there is just related to us being able to bring on more advisors from more assets. Yeah. Chris, I think, the -- on the variable balances, it's really just the contracts associated with LIBOR, resetting and coming down to where current LIBOR is. Fed funds obviously moved pretty immediately back in March and LIBOR has just moved slowly after that. I think where it sits today, if history is a guide, it's now settled in where it would typically be when Fed funds is near zero, but it's just those contracts resetting. Yeah. I mean our focus on fixed is unchanged, right, targeting that 50% to 75% zone of the overall balances and really to minimize the amount of impact on our economics as interest rates move. I think what's most relevant today is less about where the curve is and really just the amount of liquidity in the marketplace. I mean there's just not a lot of demand for those fixed rate contracts. So I think minor movements in the curve probably don't change that. I think over the long term, if the curve steepens, I think, there's a lot of opportunity economically for us to move more into fixed rate balances. You just look at where we are today at about 35% fixed. If you just look at the bottom end of that target range moving up to 50%, it's about $5 billion in balances that we can move. And I think if you look back over the last couple of years when we were moving into the fixed rate market, the sweet spot in that market was really the five-year point on the curve. So if you are just trying to run some math, I think, thinking about the opportunity at the low end of the range of $5 billion on the five-year point of the curve is the opportunity. But I think in the moment right now, there's just so much liquidity in the market, there's just not a lot of opportunity today. Yeah. I mean, I think, maybe if I bridge us from the beginning of the year, where we were buying back shares in Q1 and pretty consistently in 2019 as well. I think that pause in March was really driven by the macro uncertainty from COVID. And while we continue to monitor the macro, I think, as you heard well in the prepared remarks, the business has really strengthened. So I think all else equal, we likely would have restarted share repurchases by now. But those opportunities in organic growth and M&A have just increased and that's really where we are deploying the capital, right? Organic growth driving the highest levels in our history, we talked a fair bit about M&T and BMO onboarding next year, where just those two firms alone are $34 billion of AUM and we closed on three M&A deals in as many months in the last three months. So I think you heard right, share repurchases are attractive, but the opportunities that we are focused on right now are on organic growth and M&A. And if that changes, we will adjust consistent with our priorities and that includes allocating capital to share repurchases. Yeah. I mean the majority of that line is fees. So call it two-thirds, the three-fourth zone is fees. So transactions is a much smaller piece of it, so to answer your first question. On the Business Solutions side, it's -- right now the run rate gross profit is around $15 million for the solutions that we have so far, and I think, obviously, we expect to grow that from there. And maybe just to emphasize Dan's color a little bit earlier, we are still in the experimental phase on some of them and learning and growing from here. But I think we feel quite good about growth over the long-term. And perhaps more importantly, they are about setting up advisors for them to be able to manage their businesses and grow their balance sheets, if you will or AUM, as well as operate a more efficient practice. I think if we do that, you are going to see that show up across the P&L. I think that's really where the long-term success can come from as well."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our focus has remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This is a credit to our employees who have responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors. Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment. We believe this environment is driving several year's worth of change in just a matter of months. This pace of change is creating many new constraints and challenges to solve for throughout the industry. We see this change as an opportunity to create additional long-term value by enhancing how we serve our advisors, how our advisors take care of their clients and how we engage with and attract the best employee talent. We entered this year with momentum and the work we have done to operate in this changed environment puts us in an even stronger position to serve our advisors and grow our business going forward. Now looking ahead, we will continue to focus on investing in our platform, which helps our advisors win in the marketplace, attracts new advisors, and in turn, increases our scale and capacity to invest. This will help us deliver a market-leading platform that is the easiest place for the advisors to construct the perfect practice and run a thriving business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. With that context in mind, let's now turn to the third quarter and discuss how we are executing the key components of our business priorities while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Now let's start with how we are executing on our priorities is translating to business results. In the third quarter, our assets reached a new high of over $800 billion, driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. After consistently investing to deliver a leading advisory platform, our advisory assets continue to grow up 20% from a year ago and now are over 50% of our total assets. Moving to organic growth, net new assets remained solid at $11 billion, which translated to nearly a 6% annualized growth rate. This brought net new assets to a new high of $51 billion over the last 12 months, which translates to a 7% annualized growth rate and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. Organic growth increased throughout the quarter as expected. After the impact of client tax payments and summer seasonality in July and August, respectively, organic growth was over 7% in September, consistent with our growth rates in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, recruited assets were $10.7 billion and contributed to a new high of $41 billion over the past 12 months. These results were primarily driven by the appeal of our model and continued solid execution by our business development team. With respect to our advisor experience in the third quarter, we continued to develop solid service outcomes, driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities in technology and enhanced service experience. As a result, retention remained over 98% through the first three quarters of the year, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year ago. One of the traditional contributors to our advisor experience is our annual national conference. Now as we shared last quarter rather than cancel the event due to the environment, we pivoted our approach and in August delivered a digital experience. By moving the conference online, we enabled twice the number of people to participate this year, advisors found the content engaging and informative and appreciated the savings of both time and expense from not having to travel. That said, we continue to believe in the importance of in-person interaction as a personal connection is at the center of our industry. Given these learnings, we have the opportunity to structurally evolve how we deliver our conferences and leverage a mix of in-person and digital formats going forward. Our third quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44. Let's now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share. Now in light of this, we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. Our first strategic play, as a reminder, involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but also to increase our growth rate over time. With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to drive solid recruiting results, which include achieving higher win rates and attracting larger practices. This dynamic is also benefiting our pipeline, which expanded to new highs throughout the quarter. At the same time, we continue to increase our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. As a reminder, in July, we signed an agreement with M&T Bank to move its retail brokerage and advisory business to our platform. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with another leading institution, BMO Harris Bank. Their retail brokerage and advisory business, BMO Harris Financial Advisors plans to transition approximately $14 billion in assets and 115 financial advisors onto our platform in the first half of next year. We look forward to helping them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and grow their business. Together, these two leading banks are representative of the work we are doing to serve more large institutions. And with respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, our new affiliation models continue to gain traction. After launching our independent employee model this summer, we are seeing solid interest from prospective advisors and our pipeline is growing. We also added two more Strategic Wealth Services practices in the third quarter, which bring recruited assets on this model to approximately $1 billion. We are encouraged to see our new affiliation models building momentum and believe that they can help increase our organic growth rate over time. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate the marketplace and attract new advisors to our platform. Within this strategic play, we are focused on internally developing new capabilities, as well as opportunistically using M&A to accelerate the delivery of certain solutions. In that spirit, earlier this week, we acquired Blaze Portfolio, an advisory trading platform based in Chicago. As context, trading is a foundational piece of the advisor workflow and increasing its strategic value especially as more advisors shift to models-based practices. With the capabilities from Blaze, we will provide a more flexible and dynamic trading and rebalancing solution that enables advisors to deliver more personalized and engaging experience to their clients. Let's move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients. One of the key parts of this strategic play is transforming our service model into a client care model. As a reminder, this model is designed to provide advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them by bringing together an omnichannel platform, complex case management and self-help capabilities. After we rolled out our omnichannel and case management solutions across our service organization, they delivered a solid contribution to our advisor experience and NPS scores. We are now using speech analytics to monitor and learn from each service call to fine-tune our model and continue to increase performance and value over time. The next big category of work is self-help capabilities within client works, which will provide online, relevant and easy to navigate content that solves an advisor's needs without ever having to make a call. Our goal is to make self-help one of the easiest channels for advisors to access and navigate LPL, helping drive convenience and efficiency for their practices, while contributing to the ongoing enhancement of our advisor experience and NPS scores. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is Business Solutions. As we move through the changing environment this year, we have seen expanded utility of our original admin, marketing and CFO Solutions, as advisors leverage these offerings in different ways to solve for new challenges. The COVID-related climate also proved to be a catalyst for innovation and developing new services, like our Assurance Plan and Remote Office Solution. By continuing to learn and adapt to our advisors' changing needs, we now have a stronger and broader portfolio of solutions that are delivering more value, are applicable to more advisors and are proven across a challenging environment. As a result, our Business Solutions subscriptions have doubled over the past year to 1,200 at the end of the third quarter. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and to drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Let me take a stab at that and I will try to give you a little color and then if you have got a follow-on, please fire away. So look, I think, if you think about our growth. We, first and foremost look across all of the different models or parts of the market that we serve and look at how we are doing from new store sales, same-store sales and retention, right? And if you match that to the investments that we make strategically in our model, they are meant to serve or support any parts of that growth formula. So we obviously see record high results in the new store sales, which is referenced in the trailing 12-month recruiting that we have done, where we have brought in over $40 billion in assets, which was a record high for us, so that would reinforce that oar in the water is making good progress. I will come back to that. I think same-store sales has been durable and kind of sustained itself in a similar place over the last couple of years. This year, more of that opportunity is coming from advisors broadening their value to existing clients and ultimately getting rewarded for that value by gathering more assets with those existing clients, which is a bit of a different shift from prior years where they may get a higher mix of that growth from new clients that they attract. And then on the retention front, clearly, that's us investing in our model, improving and enhancing the service experience, the technology capabilities, our ability to serve and support and evolve the model going forward and sort of play out into the future where our advisor's needs are. And I think that is best reflected in the retention rate, which is up 200 basis points over the last couple of years. So I think that gives you a feel, if you will, around the different horse that we have in the water and the contribution they are making to that. So I think we are getting a good contribution across the Board with the most significant coming in the growing of the -- of new store sales or recruiting. And if I click down on the markets based on your question, most of that recruiting results over the last 12 months has come from our traditional markets, so think about our traditional independent and the institutions marketplace. We have got the three new models or markets that we are ramping in, SWS is the first one that you are beginning to see some contribution now come from that and the pipeline there is sound. More importantly, we are moving people through that pipeline and I think you will begin to see a bigger contribution of that in 2021 from the SWS model, our Strategic Wealth Services model. Then you also have our employee-based model or Linsco model, as we have branded it and that is just new to the marketplace. It's getting a really positive reception. I think for some of the differentiated capabilities, we are building that pipeline. We think that solution is appealing to an interesting segment of the marketplace, and so, again, I think, we are quite bullish on the contribution that can come from that in the future and none of the growth has come from that model up to this point. And then finally, the RIA only, we are an RIA custodian or we support some RIAs. We are going in and investing in that model and evolving it, such that we think it's going to create a really interesting, compelling solution that's differentiated in the marketplace at a time where we expect to see some churn pick up in that part of the marketplace. So that's a little bit of how we think about the contribution up to this point with those models, but then how you might think about them differently as we go forward. I hope that helps. Yeah. Steven, it's Dan. Hey. Good question. Look, with respect to Blaze and AdvisoryWorld, those are both part of our strategy where we use M&A, in some cases to help accelerate the development of our capabilities and then fully integrating those capabilities into our overall ecosystem or workflows for our advisors. And in this case, that's very much what we are doing here is capitalizing on a really good solution in property out in the marketplace and bringing it into improve and enhance the overall workflow associated with portfolio construction and development, right, and trading is a big component of that. That said, the second opportunity associated with this acquisition is certainly to continue to support the market share that they have outside of the LPL platform and that is our intent to do that here. It's to continue to serve and support it, continue to invest and innovate in the capability and tool and certainly evolve that offering to those clients. I think by doing that, it gives us the chance to continue to learn and understand how to serve a marketplace outside of the LPL platform, which then strategically positions us and reserves the right to if we ever want to shift or pivot and begin to serve that third-party marketplace in a more significant way. I think it gives us the foundation to work from and do that well. So though not the priority right now, it certainly is a strategic element of value here that gives us the chance to learn and allows us to be positioned to do that. Yes. So, Alex, it's Dan. Let me take the first half of that and then I will let Matt finish up with sort of part B of that. So, look, with respect to the general financial institutions marketplace. We have seen some good solid momentum over the last couple of years, and as you all know, it's roughly a $1 trillion asset marketplace, and roughly a third of that business is outsourced today. So last year, we recruited $5 billion, which mainly would have been share that's coming from what was already outsourced. This year we are on track to double those results, and again, it's mainly where there are participants that are already outsourcing that solution or service. I think strategically, we challenged ourselves around this concept of can we add value to a part of the marketplace that traditionally hasn't outsourced, and if so, how might you do that, in this case, it's these larger financial institutions. And so I think what we have done is try to go in and innovate or ensure that we could deliver for them a differentiated client experience, which we know is important in their overall offering out in the marketplace and how they position themselves and if we can complement that and extend that overall value proposition in a differentiated way, that's interesting. If we can find ways of which to optimize the financial contribution of this type of business line within the financial institutions would be a second place that we focused on. And finally, ultimately, shifting the risk profile for them, I think, is typically an appealing characteristic of the model. And so those are the areas that we focused on to try to come up with innovative ways of which to shift that, evolve that, such that this market that had never been outsourced became an opportunity and that's where we focused. And try to show up with a differentiated solution and have had the opportunity to have that dialogue with some of these financial institutions. We think it's pretty appealing. It's a pretty unique model and I think we have got a couple of wins and we are out there actively sharing that concept in that model. Though not for everyone, we think it's pretty appealing, so that's the concept we have used to try to extend the market, if you will, in this channel. I hope that answers your question. Yeah. I think the fundamental point, Alex, which is a good one that you are making is, where there's change, there's usually a broad set of different questions or new needs that come up or people contemplate new scenarios that they may not have faced before. And we do think the environment, as we look out for any number of reasons, including potential tax law changes, certainly drives more consolidation and activity on the M&A front and whether that be at the advisor level, which is a logical place to ask that question or more at the corporate level. I think we see that landscape being -- and the trajectory of the activity, they are trending up on both fronts. And obviously, as we have said, from a strategic standpoint, we would typically be a participant on both of those levels as we have in the past couple of years and we would take our disciplined approach where we make sure that these acquisitions make sense from a strategic standpoint, a financial one and operationally. But I think we are aligned in the premise of your question that you are going to see more activity. Yeah. Hey. Thanks for the question. And let me take a first run at that and you fill in anything, Matt, that you think would be helpful. So I think if you look at Q3 as a jumping off point where you had roughly a 6% annualized growth rate. That was driven by, certainly, July as you say, with the tax payment trends and that will pop up next year in April rather than in July, let's hope. But I think you will certainly see that headwind in that particular month that the tax payments occurs and then there's always a little seasonality in the summer. But let's just say that 6% to 7% is the right more blended jumping off rate. I think as we look out and push ourselves or challenge ourselves to drive that number forward or higher outside of the $34 billion that comes from the two large financial institutions that we referred to. I think we see us continuing to invest in our model that makes it more appealing, improve the effectiveness of our own sales activities and business development activities. Our traditional markets continue to contribute to that -- to a higher growth rate in terms of new recruiting. I think our new markets, as you supplement them then. They begin to contribute because, as I said up to this point, we have had very little contribution from them. So we see that as an opportunity as they ramp in more robustly next year. So those are both places where we would challenge ourselves to continue to extend the growth rate especially as the new store sales. We continue to invest in the model from a service experience standpoint and we have got retention levels at the 98% level now. We think that's a pretty sound and solid outcome. So I think as we go forward and continue to invest in that service experience, that's probably a good way to think about retention. And then I think same-store sales is a place that we continue to believe there's more opportunity there and we continue to innovate, especially inside Business Solutions with a new offering called Growth Solutions that is in the experimental phase right now, where we are being more explicit and coming up with new ways of which to help advisors grow their existing businesses and so though I don't think that's a short run opportunity, we do see that as a long-term opportunity to tease out more contribution in same-store sales. So I hope that helps you as we think about at least going into next year, where that ramp would come is probably new store sales and longer term you probably get it from new store and same-store. Yeah. So let me take some of those and get, if I miss one or two of the different sub-questions in there, please just redirect me. But -- and so look, we believe that this models based approach or models management based approach that's emerging inside advisor's practices is a significant and sustainable trend. It's a really good way for them to optimize portfolio construction in a really efficient way and construction/management. And it applies both as rep as PM all the way over to your Centrally Managed platforms. And so we see the opportunity to make investments in this models based approach being relevant across that entire advisory platform. That said, if you go move over to the Centrally Managed concepts, I think, where we are trying to make investments and where we actually believe we can continue to drive growth and participation on those platforms, continuing to add, what I might call, variations to them. So you heard us talk a lot about rep sleeve, which is an ability to use Centrally Managed platform and just outsource less than the turnkey option or alternative and that extends the applicability now of that model to more advisors as an example. We continue to make other investments in that platform and pull in other underlying securities. So you pull in individual equities, you pull in SMAs and now you are beginning to enrich that overall Centrally Managed platform and you are going to have a lot more advisors utilize it for a variety of different reasons for their clients. So think about variations to the Centrally Managed solution and also think about extending the overlying strategies that you can apply to it and the different securities that you could use within it. So there's lots of ripe opportunity there to continue to invest in our platform to extend its applicability to a lot more advisors and help us drive more assets there or contribute more assets. I think, also, as you know, we make investments from a pricing standpoint typically each year. And we have tended to focus on advisory and we will continue to do that as we move forward, our advisory platforms and this would be an area where, again, you lower minimums, you simplify pricing, you lower pricing on your Centrally Managed platforms, you are going to draw more utilization of them there too. So that's sort of the spectrum of how we think about the opportunity to enrich its appeal to the advisors and ultimately how they use it to serve their clients. Yeah. I think a couple of thoughts there. It's actually a broad appeal across the Board. So there's not one segment that we built it for. It's meant to have broad application across the platform. I think as more advisors are using more advisory solutions in their overall mix, that just overarching demand will tease out the opportunity for more to test, experiment and use it. We see them using it across a client size now. That typically ranges somewhere from $100,000 to $0.25 million in assets and that's not to say it was built that way, but that tends to today fill a sweet spot in perhaps how it's used. I think we continue to work on the pricing. You will enable it to be used up market. And I also think you see advisors who have traditionally been rep as PM or had done the portfolio construction and management themselves. As their time is pressured in general or they want to allocate it to other higher value services, you are seeing more and more experiment with shifting some of that traditional rep as PM work over to Centrally Managed model. So making it easy to convert from one model to the other, putting them all inside one platform under one contract takes out the friction associated with that transition or that movement and as we do that over the next year or so, we also think that will unlock some movement towards these Centrally Managed solutions. Yeah. It's Dan. Let me try to swing at that. So maybe the second one first, I think, so first of all, this concept about helping an advisor run and optimize how they operate their business. There's new capabilities there that the independent space hasn't always been focused on solving for. And I think our principle was make sure that we build something that is digital in nature so you can scale it and personalize it but also make sure it has the ability to help the business owner or advisor execute versus just sort of sharing more best practices with them. So the concept was to fix an execution challenge not a know-how or a knowledge challenge. And so in that spirit, that continues to be our focus with respect to all of these solutions and that's what resonates regardless of the model. The traditional independent model, typically the independent has experienced where some of those challenges or friction points are. And when they get the leverage of an admin or a CFO that can provide, in the case of an admin, just leverage points of time where there's task to do that are better outsourced to someone where they can focus and allocate that time to higher value tasks. The CFO, though, provides them real knowledge and insight that they may not have had or had the luxury of leveraging to help them enrich their decision making. So it resonates for the independent who has actually already experienced the friction. It resonates with the Strategic Wealth Services, because that's an advisor that's coming out of an employee model that is curious about and a little apprehensive about running a business and these services being available to them is a great leverage point and a boost to confidence in being able to do that. So those are two examples of where a new model that resonates and on an independent model, same value but one's got a different experience, but it resonates with them and I think you are seeing equal appeal, as we describe those services in any of those models. I think what we have had to do, remember, we are still really in a phase of innovation and iteration and so we are constantly learning how to tweak, how to evolve, how to add capabilities, elements or prioritize those in these services. And so this year has been a great learning opportunity for us to take the traditional admin, CFO and marketing solutions and evolve their utility or listen to what our client's needs through a different environment, in a tough environment and really enrich the value associated with those solutions such that they broaden the appeal to more advisors. The other thing we are thinking about doing is how do we continue to lower the cost, lower the price point and again extend the appeal to more advisors. So those are the things that we are doing inside Business Solutions to drive, we think increased adaptability and leverage of those solutions. What's growing the fastest? We have seen good consistent growth across the traditional three, admin, CFO, CMO. We were actually concerned inside the pandemic that people would be concerned about paying for them and maybe you would see attrition pickup and we saw the opposite, people really get great value out of these solutions during it. It actually reinforce their durability and their value, and again, as we said, we extended their versatility or their utility to these clients. And so though I think it did hurt selling to new advisors in the short run because of the environment. We think the value proposition is reinforced and we have seen growth rates begin to pick up post that the sort of the height of the pandemic. I think the two new solutions that we mentioned, especially the Assurance Plan, have been the biggest drivers of growth in the last quarter. The Assurance Plan really resonates when you think about helping someone protect their business in the event of an untimely or unplanned impact to their lives and it creates a really interesting way of which to preserve the asset that they have created in their business and create an orderly way of which to ensure that it protects that asset for their family and for those end clients of it and make sure for an orderly transition at a reasonable market based valuation. So that has been very attractive, because that gap out in the marketplace did not exist, especially for advisors who are in their 40s and 50s and have a longer runway left to operate their businesses. It's an extremely attractive value. Yeah. Good question. Certainly, this environment, we have seen movement of advisors are churned as we call it down. As you look over the last nine months, 10 months, churn rates are down but our win rates are up. So the team has done a great job of persevering through some of the complexities created by the environment and I think you have continued to share the story and helped advisors find creative ways of which to still make that transition. We expect that creativity in that approach and sort of that resilient heads down. Keep moving forward approach to be taken by our team as we move forward. We do believe that as you get to the other side of the pandemic that it's reasonable to expect churn rates to trend up and with the additional models we have, applying them across multiple markets where the churn rate comes up, we think about that as an interesting opportunity. So I think your premise is correct. Thank you. Hi, Will. Yeah. So let me take that one. I think to maybe come back to your final point and question. We think somewhere in that 2% to 3% range is what we are trying to play to and we think that's a reasonable landing place for attrition, so conversely 97% to 98% of retention. I think you had, in the first part of the year, some benefit or tailwind, if you will, around retention, just because of the pandemic and what we said earlier, lower churn in the overall marketplace kind of showed up there, maybe with a little bit of help. But, I think, again, the growing appeal of the model, the capability set that we are trying to invest in, the service experience we can deliver is really the drivers of that retention rate and we think a reasonable place is that 97% to 98% range. Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day and please stay safe."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the LPL Financial\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Dan Arnold, President and CEO. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Dilan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, in the face of a challenging operating environment, our advisors have responded with resilience, flexibility and ingenuity. I want to acknowledge the essential roles they are playing by providing much needed financial advice to millions of Americans, while at the same time, pivoting their own practices to work remotely. I also want to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. Now while the environment we are operating in has changed, our principles remain the same. We believe a good strategy matched with extraordinary execution and alignment with a mission-driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Following those principles, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on executing the components of our business priorities, while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Today, I will share color on both of those areas. Starting with our business results. Organic growth remained solid as second quarter net new assets totaled $13 billion, which translated to a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was our third quarter in a row at 7% or higher and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. In the second quarter, recruited assets were at new high at $11.1 billion. These results against the backdrop in which industry advisor movement was down by over 30% from a year ago are a testament to the appeal of our model and the performance of our business development team. Looking at the past year, recruited assets were nearly $39 billion, which is also a new high for the team. With respect to the advisor service experience, we were able to pull forward solid outcomes in a challenging operating environment as our Net Promoter Scores remain consistent with the increased levels we delivered in Q1. Additionally, our retention was at a new high of over 98% for the first half of the year as the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and enhanced service experience continue to resonate with advisors. These key business results also led to solid financial outcomes with second quarter EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Now while we remain focused on operating the business in the second quarter, the influence of the remote work environment created new challenges and opportunities to solve for. As an example, to help advisors effectively operate remotely, we developed a bundle of new and enhanced capabilities, including an online calendaring solution for advisors and their clients to schedule time to meet virtually; intra-office instant messaging for advisors to stay connected with their staff remotely; and a more digitized, Centrally Managed Platform experience with greater model flexibility. We also continue to evolve how we engage with our advisors in the new and more virtual landscape. Instead of canceling our national advisor conference this summer, we pivoted to a fully digital experience. Similar to the format of our traditional in-person meeting, the 3-day program will include livestream general sessions, a mix of breakout meetings, technology demos, a virtual sponsor exhibit hall and online networking. With the event now online, we can potentially reach all 17,000 of our advisors and their staff rather than the 5,000 who might normally attend in-person. As we look forward, we expect new virtual approaches like these will become another way that we can support our advisors and their clients over time. Let\u2019s now turn to our progress executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice, and believe we are better positioned than ever to serve our advisors and compete for additional market share. In light of this, we remain focused on executing the strategy we\u2019ve shared with you in the past. And while that strategy has not changed, we have evolved from 3 Strategic Plays to 4, which enhances our focus on how we innovate and execute on our strategic agenda. You can see our updated framework in our Investor Presentation. Now with that as context, let\u2019s walk through our progress on our strategic priorities, starting with our first Strategic Play. This play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion. With respect to our traditional markets, the appeal of our model continues to attract more advisors on to our platform and strengthen our pipeline. In addition, the continued evolution of our digital capabilities within the sales process and for advisor onboarding has proven to be an increasing source of competitive advantage. As a result, interest from prospective advisors continue to grow, and our pipeline is the largest in our history. Another opportunity to grow in our traditional markets is by increasing our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. Yesterday, we announced that we reached an agreement with M&T Bank to transition its wealth management business on to our platform. M&T is a top 25 U.S. bank with approximately $20 billion in brokerage and advisory assets and 170 financial advisors. They will become our largest financial institution client when they onboard next year. We look forward to the opportunity to help them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and contribute to growth in their business. With respect to our new affiliation models, in June, we launched our independent employee offering. We\u2019re seeing solid early interest from prospective advisors, and we expect the model to contribute to our opportunity set, pipeline and results going forward. We\u2019re also using M&A of advisor-owned practices as an additional source of growth. The 2 acquisitions we announced over the past quarter, Lucia Securities and E.K. Riley have approximately 55 advisors and $3.5 billion of assets combined. Approximately 95% of advisors across those 2 firms have committed to join, and both transactions are on track to close later this year. Our second Strategic Play is focused on providing capabilities that help advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. This in turn helps existing advisors grow their practices and attracts new advisors to our platform. Within this play, we are focused on equipping advisors with digital capabilities to help increase their accessibility, deepen their relationships, attract new clients and lower their costs. In that spirit, over the past quarter, we began the rollout of our new mobile app. This solution goes beyond typical transactional information to create a new way for advisors to help their clients digitally engage in their personal financial journeys. The tool enables advisors to personalize the interface for their practice and individual clients, while also providing clients with enhanced views of progress towards their financial goals. As we look ahead, we plan to continue to invest in this area to help advisors enhance the overall experience for their clients. Let\u2019s next move to our third Strategic Play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients, which in turn, increases our ability to attract and retain advisors. The main components of this Strategic Play are transforming our service model into a client care model and using robotics and artificial intelligence to deliver instantaneous processes. As part of our service model transformation, I want to highlight 2 technology-driven enhancements that we made over the past quarter. First, we scaled our omnichannel capabilities from 3,000 advisors to nearly 16,000. This means nearly all of our advisors benefit from the combination of interactive voice recognition with skills-based routing to a service professional, who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Second, we introduced new speech analytics capabilities to enhance our quality management. We are now using artificial intelligence and machine learning to capture and score the sentiment of each service call. This positions us to quickly identify emerging service issues and more systemically and proactively address it. At the same time, we can also use this data to enrich how we develop and manage our service professionals. Our advisors continue to share positive feedback on our service model transformation, and tell us that it is a key contributor to our increased Net Promoter Scores and retention levels. Our fourth Strategic Play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced Business Solutions and advisor-focused capital solutions. With respect to Business Solutions, in early June, we introduced our newest offering, the Assurance Plan. As context, across our industry, 70% of advisors don\u2019t have a succession solution in place. The Assurance Plan can help our advisors with this challenge by protecting the value of their businesses in the event of an unplanned exit. With this plan, we provide an annual valuation, and we facilitate a commission-free sale to another qualified LPL advisor at a guaranteed minimum purchase price. This gives advisors the peace of mind that their family and clients will be taken care of, and it strategically positions us to continue serving clients and assets through succession events. After launching in June, we signed over 150 subscribers in the first 2 weeks. We look forward to continuing to providing this solution along with our broader portfolio of offerings to help advisors run and grow their businesses. Before closing, I also want to share that we have thought a lot about the growing need in our businesses and our country to address issues of inequality. To inform our learning, the management committee and I have been talking with business leaders, advisors and employees in the black community while simultaneously engaging with all members of the LPL family in the spirit of understanding and building empathy. Within LPL, there is a broad consensus around the desire to take action to make a difference. In order to do that, we are creating a strategy to promote racial equality and equity at LPL. There are definitely no easy or quick fixes to solve these challenges, but we are committed to making progress for our advisors and their clients, our employees and future generations. In summary, in the second quarter, we continue supporting our advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we see an opportunity to not just return to business as usual, but rather create a future that is better than ever for our advisors and their clients. We believe that continuing to execute on our strategy will achieve this goal and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: Thank you, Dan, and I\u2019m glad to speak with everyone on today\u2019s call. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I just wanted to encourage everyone to take a look at Page 3 of our press release. We described several non-GAAP measures that Dan and I used to discuss the business. And as the name would state, they are non-GAAP measures, and we provide reconciliations to each of the relevant GAAP measures. In addition, on Page 4 of that release, we also describe some forward-looking statements that Dan and I will use to discuss our business results today, and actual results could vary materially from those estimates. So please keep that in mind as well. Now as we turn to the quarter, the macro environment remains uncertain, but we have never been more certain about the importance of the role our advisors play in helping their clients achieve their financial goals and dreams. That is why we continue to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisors to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. These investments, in turn, help us drive growth, and in Q2, we generated the highest organic growth rate in our history. So as we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we see to continue serving our advisors, growing our business and creating long-term shareholder value. Now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter results, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. They were $762 billion, up 14% from Q1, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $13 billion or a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was the highest quarterly level we have recorded and double our pace from a year ago. Moving to recruiting and retention, which are 2 key drivers of organic growth, both reached new highs in the second quarter. Recruited assets were $11.1 billion, and retention was 98.6% year-to-date. Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2. Advisory assets increased to over 49% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory net new assets of $10.2 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, Centrally Managed net new assets were $1.3 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate. Now let\u2019s turn to our Q2 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with continued expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $131 million, down $31 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by seasonally higher production bonus expense, lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline and lower sales commissions. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $131 million in Q2, down $3 million sequentially as average assets decreased in the quarter. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $116 million, down $35 million from Q1, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated throughout the quarter and finished Q2 at $45 billion. I also want to give you an update on our ICA portfolio. As a reminder, when ICA balances increased rapidly in March, we took action that same month to secure $5 billion of new variable rate capacity. This allowed us to minimize the amount of overflow balances, which currently have a yield close to 0. In Q2, we continued that work by adding another $5 billion of variable rate capacity, which allowed us to move the remaining overflow balances to higher-yielding contracts. We also continue to grow our fixed rate portfolio by adding another $1 billion of fixed rate balances, bringing the total to over $13 billion. I would note that given the flatness of the yield curve, we added these new balances at the 1-year point, which was about 60 basis points at the time. As for client cash yields, our Q2 ICA yield was 127 basis points, down 68 basis points from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of the Q2 ICA portfolio enhancements that I highlighted. Looking ahead to Q3, our ICA yield will reflect the remaining impact of lower LIBOR rates as well as the maturity of $0.5 billion of fixed rate balances. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q2, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to be around 115 basis points. Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues, they were $119 million, down $18 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower transaction volumes following the record Q1 activity levels. Looking ahead to Q3, volumes have returned to more normalized levels, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenues of around $5 million from Q2. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $222 million in Q2, roughly flat to Q1. This brings our Core G&A expense for the first half of the year to an annualized run rate of about $890 million, which is below the low end of our outlook range. Looking ahead, as our investments are resonating with advisors and driving record levels of growth, we feel confident in our spending plans for the second half of the year. At the same time, the operating environment remains volatile. So we plan to stay flexible and dynamic on expense management. Given these factors, we continue to manage to the lower half of our Core G&A range of $915 million to $940 million. Moving on to promotional expenses, they were $45 million, down $13 million sequentially as we had no major conferences in Q2. Looking ahead to Q3, we will host our national advisor conference, and while we pivoted to a virtual format, we are still investing to create a meaningful and engaging conference experience for our advisors, including a new digital platform, content over several days and outside speakers. Given the conference as well as continued growth and transition assistance from our recruiting success, we expect our Q3 promotional expense to be around $60 million. Moving on to capital allocation. Our framework continues to be investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. Looking at the components of our framework, organic growth continues to provide the highest and most attractive returns on our capital. Our investments here are working well, so we plan to continue prioritizing organic growth as we deploy capital. M&A can also provide compelling returns, and while the timing is inherently difficult to predict, we want to remain positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they arise. As for capital returns to shareholders, given our focus on preserving capital for organic growth and M&A, combined with the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we plan to remain paused on share repurchases for now, though we will stay flexible and dynamic as we move forward. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q2, including the highest organic growth rate in our history. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good evening, everyone and hope you are staying healthy. We can see from Slide 16 that LPL now represents 15% of the bank market after the M&T partnership closes mid next year. Can you help us think about the size and timing of future partnerships with the remaining 85% of the market that is not currently serviced by LPL?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. And look, I think as we look at the bank marketplace, as you say, it\u2019s roughly $1 trillion. And if you click that down further, about 2/3 of the market today does not outsource to a third-party provider like ourselves, about roughly 1/3 does. And what we\u2019ve been doing is exploring our opportunity set in that overall $1 trillion market. One way to do that was to explore working on new expanded solutions that would make outsourcing more appealing to larger banks and create that openness and willingness to explore a strategic alternative. And so with respect to M&T, that\u2019s what we were able to do. And they run their own BD today or broker-dealer today and RIA post that and transitioning to our platform. The value that we would offer is \u2013 will reduce their risk across this business line significantly. We help enhance their client experience and the solutions that are made available to them across this business line. We\u2019ll increase the financial contribution of this program to the overall enterprise, and we can also work on custom integrations that help create unique offerings to their clients. And so we think that\u2019s an interesting and compelling solution for larger banks that has historically not outsourced this business line. And so we\u2019re using that solution to engage in some other financial organizations that tend to be in larger in size and exploring whether or not it would be an interesting option or alternative for them. So that\u2019s where we are in that process. So I hope that helps answer your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Dan. Very helpful there. And then we\u2019ve been very impressed with the progression of your organic growth over the last few years, now around 8%, very high level. In 2021, when you have both the employee and pure RIA channels open, I wanted your thoughts to see if we could get another step-up in the firm\u2019s organic growth rate?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So our strategy with respect to our overall organic growth is absolutely to continue to work on increasing that growth rate. Q2, we were able to achieve 7.8% annualized growth rate. We had good momentum coming into the quarter, which was always helpful as we have had 7-plus percent growth rates in the prior 2 quarters. We continue to see and invest in the appeal of the model. So it continues to evolve and grow, and that certainly is helpful. We\u2019ve also seen the continued improvement enhancement of the overall efficacy of our business development team and their ability to share our message and do it in really create an effective digital and data-driven ways. And we think that those 2 are big time structural drivers to the overall value of our model, and the ability to then continue to achieve these types of growth rates. At the same time, if we continue to improve the service experience that enhances our overall retention numbers, you get a really good, strong baseline performance. You add to that these new models like the independent employee model, as an example, and that begins to be an additional catalyst or leg up to give us more opportunities in the batter\u2019s box to drive greater growth. And so we continue to drive up growth rates in our traditional markets. We get more swings in the batter\u2019s box with these new markets. We think those 2 things together will help us continue to drive up growth. You complement that with continuing to increase your retention levels and maintain good same-store sales levels, you end up driving up growth. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. We feel good about our ability to do that.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thanks very much. I was just sort of wondering, given the \u2013 the exit momentum you\u2019ve had through the quarter \u2013 thank you for the monthly details, if you could maybe just sort of color out or frame out the July trends. And I\u2019m sort of curious around sort of net new asset and mix dynamics, what\u2019s happening with cash? And then underneath that, Matt, I think you said, if you $630 million sort of yield levels, but I think yields have come in a little bit more since then. So how to sort of think about that stress test on the ICA yield?\nMatt Audette: Yes. Sure, Bill. I mean, I think when we look at July on cash balances, remember, I\u2019m sure you do, but just for everybody, remember, the first month of a quarter is when the largest buck of advisory fees gets charged to clients. So that will naturally reduce cash. So if you put that aside and just look at the activities for cash balances in July, they\u2019ve actually grown. So you\u2019ve started to see, not substantially, but they\u2019ve moved up a little bit. I think on the yields, it\u2019s \u2013 I think the 115 basis point comment was where everything was at the end of the quarter. I haven\u2019t seen anything so far in July that would meaningfully move that. On the net new asset trends, just keep in mind the shift in the tax deadline this year from April to July, I think in the month that personal income taxes are due, I think you see across our industry, we are no different. That\u2019s usually a net new asset month that\u2019s relatively subdued as people are using those investable assets to pay some taxes. And what you typically see is subdued NNA through most of the month. And then as you get towards the end of the month, when you\u2019re removed from that tax deadline, you start to see NNA come back to more normalized levels. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen in July. As we kind of come in here towards the end of the month, we\u2019re starting to ramp back up at levels that are consistent with Q2. So I think I got \u2013 I think that covers all 3 questions, right?\nBill Katz: Yes. Well, that\u2019s my first question. Okay. Thank you for taking that. Second one, just maybe a big picture question. Certainly appreciate sort of the added opportunity set with the Assurance Program. Is there any balance sheet recourse risk that we need to think through on this effort?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I\u2019ll take that one, too, Bill. I mean, no. I mean, I think the key thing is to keep in mind what the plan is. And I think Dan described it well in his remarks, but it\u2019s really about helping advisors bridge the value of their business, if they do end up having an unfortunate event, an untimely passing or disability where they can\u2019t continue to serve their clients. And you can imagine, as a retail investor, if all of a sudden, your advisor is not there, a quick transition is really, really important to preserve the value of that practice. So I think that\u2019s the primary thing that we do. We provide that peace of mind and that guarantee. But also when you look across our practice with 17,000 advisors, I think we\u2019ve got a long list of folks that are quickly and qualified to be buyers of these practices. So I\u2019d really view it as us providing a service to really bridge in an instance like this and really protect the value of the practice for the family really and also to get those retail investors to a new home where they can be served well. So I think that\u2019s the number one thing I keep in mind.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good evening. So I wanted to start off \u2013 on the last earnings call, Dan, you spoke of some of the challenges potentially marketing, Business Solutions during work from home, but we did see some nice acceleration in terms of subscriber additions in Q2. I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that contributed to that positive surprise. And just with the addition of new solutions, including remote office and succession planning, is Business Solutions still expected to be accretive to firm-wide ROA? And are the \u2013 said differently, are the fee dynamics still better than the blended ROA for the firm?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Steven, thanks. So with respect to the sort of the first part of that question, I think if you look back at Business Solutions over the quarter, you saw a couple of things occurring. A, you saw advisors very much focused on serving and supporting their existing clients. And the \u2013 sort of the extreme conditions they were in of having to focus and spend significant amount of time with their clients, that created new opportunities. As an example for our virtual CMO program, where the CMO shifted to helping their advisors manage those client relationships and those client communications. With respect to the CFO offering, the downside planning and helping them understand cash flows and to think about how to transition through any potential change within their practice was clearly an important value to provide in the short run, and then certainly having a virtual admin made it much, much easier to move to a remote environment. So probably the most significant thing that occurred in the quarter is that really reinforced the structural value associated with the Business Solutions. And I think you\u2019re now seeing, as we come out of that volatile period, that reinforcement of that value, we\u2019re very optimistic on the continued potential increase in subscriptions associated with those traditional solutions. Inside the quarter itself, it was hard for advisors that weren\u2019t using those practices to pull up and try to engage in them and start them a new inside the quarter, given the focus on their clients. So we didn\u2019t see as many new sales on those items within the quarter, but again, I think we\u2019re seeing that trend change as we\u2019re coming out of that period of volatility. What we\u2019ve also seen, though, is the ability to continue to innovate and add new capabilities and new solutions, whether it be the Assurance Plan, whether it be a Remote Office Solution, it helped advisors quickly pivot to operating remotely with this turnkey technology solution. So we continue to create new services within the overall offering. Those new services drove a higher proportion of the overall sales in Q2 than the traditional ones did. And if you look at the overall mix or the ROA, we still expect that to have a higher contribution than the overall baseline business. That said, some of these services are more labor intensive and scale differently. So they would probably have higher revenue and higher cost. Some of these new solutions, like the Assurance Plan, would have lower revenue but much lower cost. And so that would be a way to maybe think about the traditional solutions versus the \u2013 some of the newer ones that we\u2019ve just come up with in the quarter. I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: Yes. Thanks, Dan. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up for Matt. I was hoping you could give some additional detail relating to the M&T transaction, and how should we be thinking about the potential earnings accretion from this deal? And maybe just any context you can give around the blended ROA that you typically earn on these bank mandates and any incremental costs associated with servicing those assets?\nMatt Audette: Yes. Sure, Steve. I think when you look at an institution like an M&T, those firms are usually more brokerage than advisory. So if you look at \u2013 if we just start with the baseline of the gross profit ROA on our brokerage business, which is in the 15 to 20 basis point range, and an institution of this size, I think, would be at the lower end of that, right, so 15 basis points. And then when you look at the cost to serve because of that same size and scale, the cost to serve would be \u2013 also be a lot lower. And then you add on top of that, the transition assistance, which we \u2013 our principle of underwriting for returns would be matched up here. So you put all that together from a \u2013 if we look at it from an EBITDA margin lens, it would be accretive to our EBITDA margins, if you just look at what we delivered this quarter. So I think we\u2019re \u2013 as Dan said in his remarks, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to serve M&T and help them help their clients.\nSteven Chubak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. So Matt, first question I wanted to dig a little bit more on the promotional expense guidance. So I appreciate the conference, but it\u2019s still a pretty meaningful step up sequentially, and it feels like the virtual conference, should be somewhat cheaper than the actual conference. So maybe help bridge the delta from this quarter to next quarter? What\u2019s TA versus what\u2019s the conference? And I guess, just a little bit bigger picture, given the success you guys are having recruiting in a virtual format, should we be thinking about the promotional expense relative to the growth of the company just being a little bit slower, I guess, a smaller percentage going forward once things are normalized?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think on the second question, Alex, the teams that are doing the recruiting, those costs show up in Core G&A, not promotional. So I think that\u2019s just inherent in our Core G&A guidance on the cost and the efficiencies that we would get in doing that. On your first question, I think that probably the thing that maybe makes the swing be a little bit higher is, we didn\u2019t have any conferences in Q2. I think we typically have one of our larger conferences in Q1, another large one in Q2 and then our largest in Q3. So with that, I think you\u2019ve got a trend that looks a little bit higher, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 both Dan and I talked about in the prepared remarks, I think well to state the obvious, we\u2019re saving on hotels and travel and things of that nature. The core point of the conference is really to get our advisors together and provide them content and opportunities to really focus on their businesses and how to grow. So I think we\u2019re really focused on doing that. We haven\u2019t done it yet. This will be our first one, and I think we\u2019ll learn and iterate based on how that goes. But I think we \u2013 I would say, sitting here now and in our planning, we feel really confident that what we are investing in the conference is going to have a great return and help those advisors grow and in turn, help us grow over time.\nAlex Blostein: Got you. And then a quick follow-up on the ICA dynamic. So saw the disclosure around a little of an incremental extension this quarter, $1 billion. It looks like you guys did it at a 60 basis point rate, which I don\u2019t recall seeing one year 60 basis points since this whole thing unfolded. Maybe a little bit more color of kind of where you were able to lock in the rate like this? And opportunistically, are there more opportunities to do kind of above-market locks similar to this?\nMatt Audette: Yes. There is one day, Alex, one day, it was at 60. So I think that our focus here on the fixed rate balances, right? I think we\u2019ve talked about it a lot on the philosophy of really minimizing the interest rate movements, allowing us to have a more stable earnings stream and focus on investing in organic growth. And I think the core of your question is, there is not a lot of opportunities right now, and I think the \u2013 hopefully, what you take away is that we\u2019re \u2013 we monitor the markets every day. We\u2019re talking to lots of banks every day. And if there is a tactical opportunity to do something that can move us forward, we\u2019re prepared and ready to do that. And I think that\u2019s how I would read the $1 billion at 60 bps. And just to state the obvious, or 60 bps, to state the obvious, that\u2019s not where rates are today, right? The curve is pretty much flat. I think the 10-year closed today at an all-time low at 53 point something. So right now, not a lot of opportunities, but if they do present themselves even for a short period of time, we\u2019ll do our best to take advantage of them.\nAlex Blostein: All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Harris: Hey, guys, a few follow-up questions on cash economics. First, banks are retrenching, loan growth is way down, so has there been any change in the appetite among banks to acquire your deposits? It doesn\u2019t sound like there has been, but maybe you could frame up the risk for that and whether that potentially might reduce your spreads? And then is there any more downside to any of your money market yields where they sit today?\nMatt Audette: Yes. Chris, I think on the cash appetite, I think what we\u2019ve seen is primarily appetite for floating balances. And I think if you just look at Q1 where we added $5 billion of capacity on floating balances in the Fed funds plus 20 to 30 range, and we added another $5 billion this quarter. I mean those are at least for \u2013 when you look at the relative size of that on our balance sheet, those are pretty substantial adds. And as I was just talking with Alex about, there is not a lot of demand and appetite on the fixed rate side for those. On the money market side, I mean, a couple of things I keep in mind. The money market sweep is really running off. So it\u2019s a product that\u2019s getting smaller and smaller. Really where our money market product is, is on the purchase money market side. And from our economics, that\u2019s really a revenue share. It\u2019s not directly tied to interest rates like the ICA account would be. So it\u2019s more of a revenue share that you can see is in the 20 basis point range, higher end of that right now. So it wouldn\u2019t be directly tied to movements in interest rates.\nChris Harris: Okay. And related, real quick, if I can. The \u2013 for the M&T transaction, what do you guys can earn on those cash balances? How does that work?\nMatt Audette: Yes. So for M&T and for banks in general, I think, to state the obvious, they are their own bank. So a lot of times institutions will just keep the cash balances and will serve their wealth management business, and that\u2019s the case in M&T. So those cash balances will be staying in their bank.\nChris Harris: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on the Centrally Managed platform, about $54 billion in assets now. I was hoping you could just share an update on some of your initiatives there, how you see that evolving in the next couple of quarters? And maybe you can also give us a little bit of sense of the profile of advisors that are taking you up on that Centrally Managed platform. What are the types that are more likely or more active users of that? And maybe what portion of those advisors have joined, say, in the past couple of years versus those that are \u2013 have been on your platform for many years?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So let me take that one. And first of all, your Centrally Managed platforms. If you think about the real structural value that you\u2019re providing is compelling investment content, right? And then secondly, the ability to save the advisor valuable admin time, where they don\u2019t have to do a lot of the administrative work and trading work associated with portfolio management, and so thinking about those as 2 core characteristics. Generally speaking, they\u2019re going to apply to any potential different personas of advisors that sit up there today with the exception of the advisor who creates most of their value through their very own portfolio construction. That being harder and harder to do and getting paid less and less for that, obviously, you\u2019re seeing a move away from that from most advisors who have a broader value proposition, and then would use the Centrally Managed platforms along with also, in some cases, using a rep directed platform. And that\u2019s the nice thing as we give them the flexibility to use whatever platform is best for whatever individual client. And so with that as a baseline and a foundation, that opens us up to a Centrally Managed solution being applicable to 70-plus percent of the advisors, and again, they can use them however they want to with inside their practice. So there is broad appeal there and broad applicability there. And I think what you\u2019re seeing is more and more advisors growing in this trend of recognizing the value of their time and the trade to save that time to use it on, what I might call, higher-margin activities. And so we do expect the demand and the utilization for the Centrally Managed platforms to continue to trend up. Now we\u2019ve got to keep investing in it, and make sure that we give them that compelling investment content that we actually are able to give them continued expansion in the savings of time by adding new functionality and new capabilities to the platform. And a great example of that was the Advisor Sleeve solution that we rolled out. We just enhanced in Q1 and Q2. That basically gave the advisor more flexibility as to how they engage in a Centrally Managed platform, where they can load and trade their \u2013 sorry, load up their own models on the Centrally Managed platform, but still get all the benefits of the time savings and the outsourcing of the trading and the operational work to us. And so that\u2019s an example of where we continue to invest. We continue to invest in the SMA platform, same concept and principle here, a Centrally Managed platform and continue to expand the functionality and flexibility will drive more growth to the platform. We also is where we\u2019re investing from a pricing standpoint. As we\u2019ve shared with you, we\u2019ve continued to use pricing as an option for an investment for the past 5 years, and Centrally Managed platforms are a place that we continue to see opportunity to do that. So I hope that answers your question, but that\u2019s some of the opportunity that we see associated with both the structural benefits and growing demand as well as some of the investments that we\u2019re making.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Much appreciated. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that as well. I guess what would you say would be the top 3 things or so you\u2019d like to add or expand or improve on that platform as you look out over the next couple of years?\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think the more we can give the flexibility for the advisor to move in and out of that platform, the better. What I mean by that is that there is certain times where the advisor wants to take the wheel and control it. And to the extent that you can give them the ability to do that on a Centrally Managed framework, we believe is a journey that we\u2019ve been on, and we\u2019ve got a few more steps to take on that. I think a second component is continuing to add certain securities to it. So you\u2019ll see us working on adding equities to the Centrally Managed platform. Historically, it\u2019s been limited to portfolios with mutual funds and ETFs. And so there is an example. And then you\u2019ll also see us pulling in SMAs to this \u2013 to our MWP platform, our sort of core Centrally Managed platform and integrating our SMA solutions into that platform. So those are 3 big things that we\u2019re working on.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good afternoon, guys. I just want to have another follow-up here on the Business Solutions. And I appreciate all the color, and obviously, good to see the continuing progress. Trying to think about just the growth trajectory, and I appreciate it does take time to scale and it\u2019s newer, but you\u2019re also learning a lot as you go here and experiments as well. So I\u2019m curious for the advisors that aren\u2019t using any of the solutions yet. Is it an education thing or a marketing dynamic thing where essentially advisors aren\u2019t aware of all the capabilities you have? And so you just need to better educate them and make sure they\u2019re aware. Or is it playing around with the pricing structures? Do you guys provide trials, so maybe you have a little bit of a sense of the backlog of what could come? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the growth trajectory and some of those dynamics.\nDan Arnold: Yes. It\u2019s a fair question, and I think there is a multitude of the different places that we would look at in order to accelerate, if you will, the growth trajectory of the solution. I think one place that you look at is definitely on the value proposition side. Does the value proposition resonate or are there other things that we can expand or do that make it even more valuable and more appealing. So we\u2019ve been able to learn a lot about that over the past 1.5 years. We continue to roll out new digital capabilities inside all of them based on the feedback and the learnings we have from the existing clients. And so we see those baseline Business Solutions becoming more and more appealing as we make those investments, which will create, we think, more and more demand. I think at the same time, we are looking at different pricing structures. Can you create different versions of these or simplified version that would have a lower price point? Can you create a different construct, as you say, to give someone a trial period to come in and really experience the value and thus better understand how they may value it relative to their own practice? And so we absolutely are exploring and experimenting with different price points and pricing structures in order to do that. And then we \u2013 the third area would be continuing to innovate on new capabilities and new solutions. The nice thing about innovation is that it gets innovation as you\u2019re working down, solving real problems or challenges for advisors inside their practice and helping them operate their business, identifies new places to create and add value. And that\u2019s what occurred as a great example with the Assurance Plan. The dialogue around that need led to 3 other questions to ask, which then created this idea or concept of how to solve for it. So we do believe there is more things that we can do down inside the practice where they either buy those services somewhere else or don\u2019t even use them today because they don\u2019t think they have access to them that we can continue to help them operate their practices. So that\u2019s the 3 ores in the water that would help drive top line growth.\nDevin Ryan: Really appreciate the color, Dan. Maybe just a quick one for Matt on the follow-up on just transaction and other. I heard the comments about kind of normalizing volumes. What are the other kind of puts and takes as we think about just the current quarter? Sometimes there is elevated kind of conference-related revenues. You\u2019re trying to think about other things that \u2013 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s seasonality as well to think about for that line, which is obviously bounced around a fair amount over the last few quarters?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think the only additional thing I\u2019d highlight, Devin, is on the \u2013 just a couple of things on fees. The seasonality of IRA fees, right, those are typically a first half seasonal meaning Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 is still a little bit elevated, but then when you get into the second half of the year, and specifically Q3, you start to see those come down. And then the other side of this, which is a great long-term item, is our retention, right? Retention is at all-time highs and meaning attrition is at all-time lows. And when those accounts leave, there is a fee charge for them to leave. So meaning the fees associated with folks leaving, accounts leaving LPL are also down, right? So great from a value standpoint long term, but in an individual quarter that puts a little bit of pressure down on fees.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nChris Shutler: Yes. Good afternoon. A few weeks ago, another large broker-dealer announced they plan to become a bank. Just given the rate environment likelihood that we might be here for some time, what would cause you to take a more serious look at that option?\nMatt Audette: Chris, this is Matt. I\u2019ll take that. I mean, I think for us, it gets back to our value proposition and how we can serve and support our clients. And I think when you think about that, you don\u2019t need to be a bank to do that, right? When you just think about the cash capabilities that we offer in sweep today, and there is lots of folks out there that you can offer additional capabilities that a bank offers without being a bank specifically. So I think we\u2019re focused on the value prop, focused on how do we provide the services and solutions for our clients and their clients, and I don\u2019t think becoming a bank is necessary to do that well.\nChris Shutler: Okay. And then secondly, can you give us a sense, even a ballpark, what percentage of assets at LPL are invested in passive investment products and ETFs more specifically? And I know it\u2019s super, super early days here, but if actively managed ETFs were to take off in a more meaningful way, how could that impact your economics?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So obviously, with passive investments, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, it is only on the advisory platform to the advisory business, where this shows up as relevant in the brokerage construct you\u2019re, obviously \u2013 an advisor is not going to use them or they don\u2019t get paid, right? So on the advisory platforms today, roughly 1/3 of the overall assets are in passive type constructs, think about mutual funds and/or ETFs. And we\u2019ve seen an ongoing trend over the past couple of years of about 1% a year. We\u2019ve shared that with you before in terms of that mix shift over time. You\u2019ll see some volatility from quarter to quarter, but on average, it\u2019s been about 1%. We see advisors using it primarily inside of a rep-driven platform where they may use it for large-cap growth or value type components of an overall portfolio. We also have passive options and alternatives on our Centrally Managed platforms as well, if an advisor want to, needs to or desires to use it in that format. So we don\u2019t see a big shift relative to how passive is being used as we go forward. Now active ETFs would create a question around how they might be utilized instead of active mutual funds, and I think it is a strategy or a way to potentially lower the cost of active management. We\u2019re supportive of lowering the cost. As the innovation around these products have occurred, we\u2019ve been in dialogue with a number of different product sponsors as to how they think about it, and how we make sure that the overall ecosystem can use those in an effective way to help lower the cost of active management and enhance the overall experience to the end investor. So it\u2019s early days now in terms of how those may be positioned and rolled out, but we\u2019re optimistic that with the emergence and evolution of active ETFs that our sponsored programs will and can be evolved and adjusted and pivoted such that it has more of a neutral impact on our overall sponsor relationships.\nChris Shutler: Got it. Thanks a lot, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. I show no further questions in the queue. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please stay safe. See you now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I just wanted to encourage everyone to take a look at Page 3 of our press release. We described several non-GAAP measures that Dan and I used to discuss the business. And as the name would state, they are non-GAAP measures, and we provide reconciliations to each of the relevant GAAP measures. In addition, on Page 4 of that release, we also describe some forward-looking statements that Dan and I will use to discuss our business results today, and actual results could vary materially from those estimates. So please keep that in mind as well. Now as we turn to the quarter, the macro environment remains uncertain, but we have never been more certain about the importance of the role our advisors play in helping their clients achieve their financial goals and dreams. That is why we continue to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisors to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. These investments, in turn, help us drive growth, and in Q2, we generated the highest organic growth rate in our history. So as we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we see to continue serving our advisors, growing our business and creating long-term shareholder value. Now let's turn to our second quarter results, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. They were $762 billion, up 14% from Q1, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $13 billion or a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was the highest quarterly level we have recorded and double our pace from a year ago. Moving to recruiting and retention, which are 2 key drivers of organic growth, both reached new highs in the second quarter. Recruited assets were $11.1 billion, and retention was 98.6% year-to-date. Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2. Advisory assets increased to over 49% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory net new assets of $10.2 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, Centrally Managed net new assets were $1.3 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate. Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with continued expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $131 million, down $31 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by seasonally higher production bonus expense, lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline and lower sales commissions. Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $131 million in Q2, down $3 million sequentially as average assets decreased in the quarter. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $116 million, down $35 million from Q1, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated throughout the quarter and finished Q2 at $45 billion. I also want to give you an update on our ICA portfolio. As a reminder, when ICA balances increased rapidly in March, we took action that same month to secure $5 billion of new variable rate capacity. This allowed us to minimize the amount of overflow balances, which currently have a yield close to 0. In Q2, we continued that work by adding another $5 billion of variable rate capacity, which allowed us to move the remaining overflow balances to higher-yielding contracts. We also continue to grow our fixed rate portfolio by adding another $1 billion of fixed rate balances, bringing the total to over $13 billion. I would note that given the flatness of the yield curve, we added these new balances at the 1-year point, which was about 60 basis points at the time. As for client cash yields, our Q2 ICA yield was 127 basis points, down 68 basis points from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of the Q2 ICA portfolio enhancements that I highlighted. Looking ahead to Q3, our ICA yield will reflect the remaining impact of lower LIBOR rates as well as the maturity of $0.5 billion of fixed rate balances. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q2, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to be around 115 basis points. Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues, they were $119 million, down $18 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower transaction volumes following the record Q1 activity levels. Looking ahead to Q3, volumes have returned to more normalized levels, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenues of around $5 million from Q2. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $222 million in Q2, roughly flat to Q1. This brings our Core G&A expense for the first half of the year to an annualized run rate of about $890 million, which is below the low end of our outlook range. Looking ahead, as our investments are resonating with advisors and driving record levels of growth, we feel confident in our spending plans for the second half of the year. At the same time, the operating environment remains volatile. So we plan to stay flexible and dynamic on expense management. Given these factors, we continue to manage to the lower half of our Core G&A range of $915 million to $940 million. Moving on to promotional expenses, they were $45 million, down $13 million sequentially as we had no major conferences in Q2. Looking ahead to Q3, we will host our national advisor conference, and while we pivoted to a virtual format, we are still investing to create a meaningful and engaging conference experience for our advisors, including a new digital platform, content over several days and outside speakers. Given the conference as well as continued growth and transition assistance from our recruiting success, we expect our Q3 promotional expense to be around $60 million. Moving on to capital allocation. Our framework continues to be investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. Looking at the components of our framework, organic growth continues to provide the highest and most attractive returns on our capital. Our investments here are working well, so we plan to continue prioritizing organic growth as we deploy capital. M&A can also provide compelling returns, and while the timing is inherently difficult to predict, we want to remain positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they arise. As for capital returns to shareholders, given our focus on preserving capital for organic growth and M&A, combined with the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we plan to remain paused on share repurchases for now, though we will stay flexible and dynamic as we move forward. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q2, including the highest organic growth rate in our history. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes. Sure, Bill. I mean, I think when we look at July on cash balances, remember, I'm sure you do, but just for everybody, remember, the first month of a quarter is when the largest buck of advisory fees gets charged to clients. So that will naturally reduce cash. So if you put that aside and just look at the activities for cash balances in July, they've actually grown. So you've started to see, not substantially, but they've moved up a little bit. I think on the yields, it's \u2013 I think the 115 basis point comment was where everything was at the end of the quarter. I haven't seen anything so far in July that would meaningfully move that. On the net new asset trends, just keep in mind the shift in the tax deadline this year from April to July, I think in the month that personal income taxes are due, I think you see across our industry, we are no different. That's usually a net new asset month that's relatively subdued as people are using those investable assets to pay some taxes. And what you typically see is subdued NNA through most of the month. And then as you get towards the end of the month, when you're removed from that tax deadline, you start to see NNA come back to more normalized levels. And that's exactly what we've seen in July. As we kind of come in here towards the end of the month, we're starting to ramp back up at levels that are consistent with Q2. So I think I got \u2013 I think that covers all 3 questions, right? Yes. I'll take that one, too, Bill. I mean, no. I mean, I think the key thing is to keep in mind what the plan is. And I think Dan described it well in his remarks, but it's really about helping advisors bridge the value of their business, if they do end up having an unfortunate event, an untimely passing or disability where they can't continue to serve their clients. And you can imagine, as a retail investor, if all of a sudden, your advisor is not there, a quick transition is really, really important to preserve the value of that practice. So I think that's the primary thing that we do. We provide that peace of mind and that guarantee. But also when you look across our practice with 17,000 advisors, I think we've got a long list of folks that are quickly and qualified to be buyers of these practices. So I'd really view it as us providing a service to really bridge in an instance like this and really protect the value of the practice for the family really and also to get those retail investors to a new home where they can be served well. So I think that's the number one thing I keep in mind. Yes. Sure, Steve. I think when you look at an institution like an M&T, those firms are usually more brokerage than advisory. So if you look at \u2013 if we just start with the baseline of the gross profit ROA on our brokerage business, which is in the 15 to 20 basis point range, and an institution of this size, I think, would be at the lower end of that, right, so 15 basis points. And then when you look at the cost to serve because of that same size and scale, the cost to serve would be \u2013 also be a lot lower. And then you add on top of that, the transition assistance, which we \u2013 our principle of underwriting for returns would be matched up here. So you put all that together from a \u2013 if we look at it from an EBITDA margin lens, it would be accretive to our EBITDA margins, if you just look at what we delivered this quarter. So I think we're \u2013 as Dan said in his remarks, we're excited about the opportunity to serve M&T and help them help their clients. Yes. I think on the second question, Alex, the teams that are doing the recruiting, those costs show up in Core G&A, not promotional. So I think that's just inherent in our Core G&A guidance on the cost and the efficiencies that we would get in doing that. On your first question, I think that probably the thing that maybe makes the swing be a little bit higher is, we didn't have any conferences in Q2. I think we typically have one of our larger conferences in Q1, another large one in Q2 and then our largest in Q3. So with that, I think you've got a trend that looks a little bit higher, but I think it's \u2013 both Dan and I talked about in the prepared remarks, I think well to state the obvious, we're saving on hotels and travel and things of that nature. The core point of the conference is really to get our advisors together and provide them content and opportunities to really focus on their businesses and how to grow. So I think we're really focused on doing that. We haven't done it yet. This will be our first one, and I think we'll learn and iterate based on how that goes. But I think we \u2013 I would say, sitting here now and in our planning, we feel really confident that what we are investing in the conference is going to have a great return and help those advisors grow and in turn, help us grow over time. Yes. There is one day, Alex, one day, it was at 60. So I think that our focus here on the fixed rate balances, right? I think we've talked about it a lot on the philosophy of really minimizing the interest rate movements, allowing us to have a more stable earnings stream and focus on investing in organic growth. And I think the core of your question is, there is not a lot of opportunities right now, and I think the \u2013 hopefully, what you take away is that we're \u2013 we monitor the markets every day. We're talking to lots of banks every day. And if there is a tactical opportunity to do something that can move us forward, we're prepared and ready to do that. And I think that's how I would read the $1 billion at 60 bps. And just to state the obvious, or 60 bps, to state the obvious, that's not where rates are today, right? The curve is pretty much flat. I think the 10-year closed today at an all-time low at 53 point something. So right now, not a lot of opportunities, but if they do present themselves even for a short period of time, we'll do our best to take advantage of them. Yes. Chris, I think on the cash appetite, I think what we've seen is primarily appetite for floating balances. And I think if you just look at Q1 where we added $5 billion of capacity on floating balances in the Fed funds plus 20 to 30 range, and we added another $5 billion this quarter. I mean those are at least for \u2013 when you look at the relative size of that on our balance sheet, those are pretty substantial adds. And as I was just talking with Alex about, there is not a lot of demand and appetite on the fixed rate side for those. On the money market side, I mean, a couple of things I keep in mind. The money market sweep is really running off. So it's a product that's getting smaller and smaller. Really where our money market product is, is on the purchase money market side. And from our economics, that's really a revenue share. It's not directly tied to interest rates like the ICA account would be. So it's more of a revenue share that you can see is in the 20 basis point range, higher end of that right now. So it wouldn't be directly tied to movements in interest rates. Yes. So for M&T and for banks in general, I think, to state the obvious, they are their own bank. So a lot of times institutions will just keep the cash balances and will serve their wealth management business, and that's the case in M&T. So those cash balances will be staying in their bank. Yes. I think the only additional thing I'd highlight, Devin, is on the \u2013 just a couple of things on fees. The seasonality of IRA fees, right, those are typically a first half seasonal meaning Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 is still a little bit elevated, but then when you get into the second half of the year, and specifically Q3, you start to see those come down. And then the other side of this, which is a great long-term item, is our retention, right? Retention is at all-time highs and meaning attrition is at all-time lows. And when those accounts leave, there is a fee charge for them to leave. So meaning the fees associated with folks leaving, accounts leaving LPL are also down, right? So great from a value standpoint long term, but in an individual quarter that puts a little bit of pressure down on fees. Chris, this is Matt. I'll take that. I mean, I think for us, it gets back to our value proposition and how we can serve and support our clients. And I think when you think about that, you don't need to be a bank to do that, right? When you just think about the cash capabilities that we offer in sweep today, and there is lots of folks out there that you can offer additional capabilities that a bank offers without being a bank specifically. So I think we're focused on the value prop, focused on how do we provide the services and solutions for our clients and their clients, and I don't think becoming a bank is necessary to do that well."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Dilan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, in the face of a challenging operating environment, our advisors have responded with resilience, flexibility and ingenuity. I want to acknowledge the essential roles they are playing by providing much needed financial advice to millions of Americans, while at the same time, pivoting their own practices to work remotely. I also want to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. Now while the environment we are operating in has changed, our principles remain the same. We believe a good strategy matched with extraordinary execution and alignment with a mission-driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Following those principles, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on executing the components of our business priorities, while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Today, I will share color on both of those areas. Starting with our business results. Organic growth remained solid as second quarter net new assets totaled $13 billion, which translated to a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was our third quarter in a row at 7% or higher and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. In the second quarter, recruited assets were at new high at $11.1 billion. These results against the backdrop in which industry advisor movement was down by over 30% from a year ago are a testament to the appeal of our model and the performance of our business development team. Looking at the past year, recruited assets were nearly $39 billion, which is also a new high for the team. With respect to the advisor service experience, we were able to pull forward solid outcomes in a challenging operating environment as our Net Promoter Scores remain consistent with the increased levels we delivered in Q1. Additionally, our retention was at a new high of over 98% for the first half of the year as the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and enhanced service experience continue to resonate with advisors. These key business results also led to solid financial outcomes with second quarter EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Now while we remain focused on operating the business in the second quarter, the influence of the remote work environment created new challenges and opportunities to solve for. As an example, to help advisors effectively operate remotely, we developed a bundle of new and enhanced capabilities, including an online calendaring solution for advisors and their clients to schedule time to meet virtually; intra-office instant messaging for advisors to stay connected with their staff remotely; and a more digitized, Centrally Managed Platform experience with greater model flexibility. We also continue to evolve how we engage with our advisors in the new and more virtual landscape. Instead of canceling our national advisor conference this summer, we pivoted to a fully digital experience. Similar to the format of our traditional in-person meeting, the 3-day program will include livestream general sessions, a mix of breakout meetings, technology demos, a virtual sponsor exhibit hall and online networking. With the event now online, we can potentially reach all 17,000 of our advisors and their staff rather than the 5,000 who might normally attend in-person. As we look forward, we expect new virtual approaches like these will become another way that we can support our advisors and their clients over time. Let's now turn to our progress executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice, and believe we are better positioned than ever to serve our advisors and compete for additional market share. In light of this, we remain focused on executing the strategy we've shared with you in the past. And while that strategy has not changed, we have evolved from 3 Strategic Plays to 4, which enhances our focus on how we innovate and execute on our strategic agenda. You can see our updated framework in our Investor Presentation. Now with that as context, let's walk through our progress on our strategic priorities, starting with our first Strategic Play. This play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion. With respect to our traditional markets, the appeal of our model continues to attract more advisors on to our platform and strengthen our pipeline. In addition, the continued evolution of our digital capabilities within the sales process and for advisor onboarding has proven to be an increasing source of competitive advantage. As a result, interest from prospective advisors continue to grow, and our pipeline is the largest in our history. Another opportunity to grow in our traditional markets is by increasing our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. Yesterday, we announced that we reached an agreement with M&T Bank to transition its wealth management business on to our platform. M&T is a top 25 U.S. bank with approximately $20 billion in brokerage and advisory assets and 170 financial advisors. They will become our largest financial institution client when they onboard next year. We look forward to the opportunity to help them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and contribute to growth in their business. With respect to our new affiliation models, in June, we launched our independent employee offering. We're seeing solid early interest from prospective advisors, and we expect the model to contribute to our opportunity set, pipeline and results going forward. We're also using M&A of advisor-owned practices as an additional source of growth. The 2 acquisitions we announced over the past quarter, Lucia Securities and E.K. Riley have approximately 55 advisors and $3.5 billion of assets combined. Approximately 95% of advisors across those 2 firms have committed to join, and both transactions are on track to close later this year. Our second Strategic Play is focused on providing capabilities that help advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. This in turn helps existing advisors grow their practices and attracts new advisors to our platform. Within this play, we are focused on equipping advisors with digital capabilities to help increase their accessibility, deepen their relationships, attract new clients and lower their costs. In that spirit, over the past quarter, we began the rollout of our new mobile app. This solution goes beyond typical transactional information to create a new way for advisors to help their clients digitally engage in their personal financial journeys. The tool enables advisors to personalize the interface for their practice and individual clients, while also providing clients with enhanced views of progress towards their financial goals. As we look ahead, we plan to continue to invest in this area to help advisors enhance the overall experience for their clients. Let's next move to our third Strategic Play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients, which in turn, increases our ability to attract and retain advisors. The main components of this Strategic Play are transforming our service model into a client care model and using robotics and artificial intelligence to deliver instantaneous processes. As part of our service model transformation, I want to highlight 2 technology-driven enhancements that we made over the past quarter. First, we scaled our omnichannel capabilities from 3,000 advisors to nearly 16,000. This means nearly all of our advisors benefit from the combination of interactive voice recognition with skills-based routing to a service professional, who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Second, we introduced new speech analytics capabilities to enhance our quality management. We are now using artificial intelligence and machine learning to capture and score the sentiment of each service call. This positions us to quickly identify emerging service issues and more systemically and proactively address it. At the same time, we can also use this data to enrich how we develop and manage our service professionals. Our advisors continue to share positive feedback on our service model transformation, and tell us that it is a key contributor to our increased Net Promoter Scores and retention levels. Our fourth Strategic Play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced Business Solutions and advisor-focused capital solutions. With respect to Business Solutions, in early June, we introduced our newest offering, the Assurance Plan. As context, across our industry, 70% of advisors don't have a succession solution in place. The Assurance Plan can help our advisors with this challenge by protecting the value of their businesses in the event of an unplanned exit. With this plan, we provide an annual valuation, and we facilitate a commission-free sale to another qualified LPL advisor at a guaranteed minimum purchase price. This gives advisors the peace of mind that their family and clients will be taken care of, and it strategically positions us to continue serving clients and assets through succession events. After launching in June, we signed over 150 subscribers in the first 2 weeks. We look forward to continuing to providing this solution along with our broader portfolio of offerings to help advisors run and grow their businesses. Before closing, I also want to share that we have thought a lot about the growing need in our businesses and our country to address issues of inequality. To inform our learning, the management committee and I have been talking with business leaders, advisors and employees in the black community while simultaneously engaging with all members of the LPL family in the spirit of understanding and building empathy. Within LPL, there is a broad consensus around the desire to take action to make a difference. In order to do that, we are creating a strategy to promote racial equality and equity at LPL. There are definitely no easy or quick fixes to solve these challenges, but we are committed to making progress for our advisors and their clients, our employees and future generations. In summary, in the second quarter, we continue supporting our advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we see an opportunity to not just return to business as usual, but rather create a future that is better than ever for our advisors and their clients. We believe that continuing to execute on our strategy will achieve this goal and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. And look, I think as we look at the bank marketplace, as you say, it's roughly $1 trillion. And if you click that down further, about 2/3 of the market today does not outsource to a third-party provider like ourselves, about roughly 1/3 does. And what we've been doing is exploring our opportunity set in that overall $1 trillion market. One way to do that was to explore working on new expanded solutions that would make outsourcing more appealing to larger banks and create that openness and willingness to explore a strategic alternative. And so with respect to M&T, that's what we were able to do. And they run their own BD today or broker-dealer today and RIA post that and transitioning to our platform. The value that we would offer is \u2013 will reduce their risk across this business line significantly. We help enhance their client experience and the solutions that are made available to them across this business line. We'll increase the financial contribution of this program to the overall enterprise, and we can also work on custom integrations that help create unique offerings to their clients. And so we think that's an interesting and compelling solution for larger banks that has historically not outsourced this business line. And so we're using that solution to engage in some other financial organizations that tend to be in larger in size and exploring whether or not it would be an interesting option or alternative for them. So that's where we are in that process. So I hope that helps answer your question. Yes. So our strategy with respect to our overall organic growth is absolutely to continue to work on increasing that growth rate. Q2, we were able to achieve 7.8% annualized growth rate. We had good momentum coming into the quarter, which was always helpful as we have had 7-plus percent growth rates in the prior 2 quarters. We continue to see and invest in the appeal of the model. So it continues to evolve and grow, and that certainly is helpful. We've also seen the continued improvement enhancement of the overall efficacy of our business development team and their ability to share our message and do it in really create an effective digital and data-driven ways. And we think that those 2 are big time structural drivers to the overall value of our model, and the ability to then continue to achieve these types of growth rates. At the same time, if we continue to improve the service experience that enhances our overall retention numbers, you get a really good, strong baseline performance. You add to that these new models like the independent employee model, as an example, and that begins to be an additional catalyst or leg up to give us more opportunities in the batter's box to drive greater growth. And so we continue to drive up growth rates in our traditional markets. We get more swings in the batter's box with these new markets. We think those 2 things together will help us continue to drive up growth. You complement that with continuing to increase your retention levels and maintain good same-store sales levels, you end up driving up growth. So that's what we're trying to do. We feel good about our ability to do that. Yes. Steven, thanks. So with respect to the sort of the first part of that question, I think if you look back at Business Solutions over the quarter, you saw a couple of things occurring. A, you saw advisors very much focused on serving and supporting their existing clients. And the \u2013 sort of the extreme conditions they were in of having to focus and spend significant amount of time with their clients, that created new opportunities. As an example for our virtual CMO program, where the CMO shifted to helping their advisors manage those client relationships and those client communications. With respect to the CFO offering, the downside planning and helping them understand cash flows and to think about how to transition through any potential change within their practice was clearly an important value to provide in the short run, and then certainly having a virtual admin made it much, much easier to move to a remote environment. So probably the most significant thing that occurred in the quarter is that really reinforced the structural value associated with the Business Solutions. And I think you're now seeing, as we come out of that volatile period, that reinforcement of that value, we're very optimistic on the continued potential increase in subscriptions associated with those traditional solutions. Inside the quarter itself, it was hard for advisors that weren't using those practices to pull up and try to engage in them and start them a new inside the quarter, given the focus on their clients. So we didn't see as many new sales on those items within the quarter, but again, I think we're seeing that trend change as we're coming out of that period of volatility. What we've also seen, though, is the ability to continue to innovate and add new capabilities and new solutions, whether it be the Assurance Plan, whether it be a Remote Office Solution, it helped advisors quickly pivot to operating remotely with this turnkey technology solution. So we continue to create new services within the overall offering. Those new services drove a higher proportion of the overall sales in Q2 than the traditional ones did. And if you look at the overall mix or the ROA, we still expect that to have a higher contribution than the overall baseline business. That said, some of these services are more labor intensive and scale differently. So they would probably have higher revenue and higher cost. Some of these new solutions, like the Assurance Plan, would have lower revenue but much lower cost. And so that would be a way to maybe think about the traditional solutions versus the \u2013 some of the newer ones that we've just come up with in the quarter. I hope that helps. Yes. So let me take that one. And first of all, your Centrally Managed platforms. If you think about the real structural value that you're providing is compelling investment content, right? And then secondly, the ability to save the advisor valuable admin time, where they don't have to do a lot of the administrative work and trading work associated with portfolio management, and so thinking about those as 2 core characteristics. Generally speaking, they're going to apply to any potential different personas of advisors that sit up there today with the exception of the advisor who creates most of their value through their very own portfolio construction. That being harder and harder to do and getting paid less and less for that, obviously, you're seeing a move away from that from most advisors who have a broader value proposition, and then would use the Centrally Managed platforms along with also, in some cases, using a rep directed platform. And that's the nice thing as we give them the flexibility to use whatever platform is best for whatever individual client. And so with that as a baseline and a foundation, that opens us up to a Centrally Managed solution being applicable to 70-plus percent of the advisors, and again, they can use them however they want to with inside their practice. So there is broad appeal there and broad applicability there. And I think what you're seeing is more and more advisors growing in this trend of recognizing the value of their time and the trade to save that time to use it on, what I might call, higher-margin activities. And so we do expect the demand and the utilization for the Centrally Managed platforms to continue to trend up. Now we've got to keep investing in it, and make sure that we give them that compelling investment content that we actually are able to give them continued expansion in the savings of time by adding new functionality and new capabilities to the platform. And a great example of that was the Advisor Sleeve solution that we rolled out. We just enhanced in Q1 and Q2. That basically gave the advisor more flexibility as to how they engage in a Centrally Managed platform, where they can load and trade their \u2013 sorry, load up their own models on the Centrally Managed platform, but still get all the benefits of the time savings and the outsourcing of the trading and the operational work to us. And so that's an example of where we continue to invest. We continue to invest in the SMA platform, same concept and principle here, a Centrally Managed platform and continue to expand the functionality and flexibility will drive more growth to the platform. We also is where we're investing from a pricing standpoint. As we've shared with you, we've continued to use pricing as an option for an investment for the past 5 years, and Centrally Managed platforms are a place that we continue to see opportunity to do that. So I hope that answers your question, but that's some of the opportunity that we see associated with both the structural benefits and growing demand as well as some of the investments that we're making. Yes. I think the more we can give the flexibility for the advisor to move in and out of that platform, the better. What I mean by that is that there is certain times where the advisor wants to take the wheel and control it. And to the extent that you can give them the ability to do that on a Centrally Managed framework, we believe is a journey that we've been on, and we've got a few more steps to take on that. I think a second component is continuing to add certain securities to it. So you'll see us working on adding equities to the Centrally Managed platform. Historically, it's been limited to portfolios with mutual funds and ETFs. And so there is an example. And then you'll also see us pulling in SMAs to this \u2013 to our MWP platform, our sort of core Centrally Managed platform and integrating our SMA solutions into that platform. So those are 3 big things that we're working on. Yes. It's a fair question, and I think there is a multitude of the different places that we would look at in order to accelerate, if you will, the growth trajectory of the solution. I think one place that you look at is definitely on the value proposition side. Does the value proposition resonate or are there other things that we can expand or do that make it even more valuable and more appealing. So we've been able to learn a lot about that over the past 1.5 years. We continue to roll out new digital capabilities inside all of them based on the feedback and the learnings we have from the existing clients. And so we see those baseline Business Solutions becoming more and more appealing as we make those investments, which will create, we think, more and more demand. I think at the same time, we are looking at different pricing structures. Can you create different versions of these or simplified version that would have a lower price point? Can you create a different construct, as you say, to give someone a trial period to come in and really experience the value and thus better understand how they may value it relative to their own practice? And so we absolutely are exploring and experimenting with different price points and pricing structures in order to do that. And then we \u2013 the third area would be continuing to innovate on new capabilities and new solutions. The nice thing about innovation is that it gets innovation as you're working down, solving real problems or challenges for advisors inside their practice and helping them operate their business, identifies new places to create and add value. And that's what occurred as a great example with the Assurance Plan. The dialogue around that need led to 3 other questions to ask, which then created this idea or concept of how to solve for it. So we do believe there is more things that we can do down inside the practice where they either buy those services somewhere else or don't even use them today because they don't think they have access to them that we can continue to help them operate their practices. So that's the 3 ores in the water that would help drive top line growth. Yes. So obviously, with passive investments, as we've discussed in the past, it is only on the advisory platform to the advisory business, where this shows up as relevant in the brokerage construct you're, obviously \u2013 an advisor is not going to use them or they don't get paid, right? So on the advisory platforms today, roughly 1/3 of the overall assets are in passive type constructs, think about mutual funds and/or ETFs. And we've seen an ongoing trend over the past couple of years of about 1% a year. We've shared that with you before in terms of that mix shift over time. You'll see some volatility from quarter to quarter, but on average, it's been about 1%. We see advisors using it primarily inside of a rep-driven platform where they may use it for large-cap growth or value type components of an overall portfolio. We also have passive options and alternatives on our Centrally Managed platforms as well, if an advisor want to, needs to or desires to use it in that format. So we don't see a big shift relative to how passive is being used as we go forward. Now active ETFs would create a question around how they might be utilized instead of active mutual funds, and I think it is a strategy or a way to potentially lower the cost of active management. We're supportive of lowering the cost. As the innovation around these products have occurred, we've been in dialogue with a number of different product sponsors as to how they think about it, and how we make sure that the overall ecosystem can use those in an effective way to help lower the cost of active management and enhance the overall experience to the end investor. So it's early days now in terms of how those may be positioned and rolled out, but we're optimistic that with the emergence and evolution of active ETFs that our sponsored programs will and can be evolved and adjusted and pivoted such that it has more of a neutral impact on our overall sponsor relationships. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please stay safe. See you now."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Josh and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, the COVID-19 virus has altered both the economy and our daily lives. Given this, I first want to thank our employees for their remarkable hard work and commitment to supporting our advisors over the past few months. And I also want to thank our advisors for continuing to provide financial guidance to millions of Americans at a time when it is needed most. More broadly, after executing on our strategy over the past several years, we have built an organization that not only performs well in good environments, but also excels in challenging times to provide strength for advisors and their clients. As we look ahead, we envision an even greater number of advisors and their clients seeking not only advice, but also the capabilities and stability LPL can provide. We are well positioned to meet this growing need and increase our market leadership. In that spirit, today I'm going to focus our discussion on three areas; first, our position and momentum entering this climate; second, how we are executing our COVID-19 contingency plans and finally, how we are driving the business forward from here.  Now, over the past several years with a focus on serving our advisors and their clients, we have built a robust and resilient operating platform, innovated on differentiated capabilities and enhanced our service experience. At the same time, we increased our balance sheet capacity and stability, which positions us to continue investing in a broad range of macro environments. This combination of business and financial strength has made our model more appealing in the marketplace and lead to positive momentum and higher levels of growth. We saw all of this reflected in our first quarter results. Organic growth continued to increase in the first quarter as net new assets totaled 12.5 billion, which translates to a 6.5% annualized growth rate. This is the highest level we have recorded and up from 4.9% in the prior quarter, as new store sales, same store sales and retention all increased on a sequential basis. Looking more closely at new store sales, recruited assets were 8.4 billion in the first quarter and 36 billion over the past year. Turning to our financial results, first quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $2.06, which was up 7% from a year ago.  With respect to results around the advisory experience, I want to highlight two key indicators of our progress in this area. First, our advisor Net Promoter scores increased by another nine points in Q1 for a total increase of roughly 55 points in just over two years. Second, annualized production retention was a new high of 99% in the first quarter. As we look ahead, we will continue to work to drive favorable outcomes like these by investing in capabilities and technology, transforming our service model and attracting and developing extraordinary talent with our mission driven culture. Now, let's move to how we are executing our contingency plans for COVID-19. We first identified the principles that mattered most to guide our efforts, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and protecting the health of our employees. We then used a data driven agile approach to work through this effort. Our Management Committee met daily to assess the changing dynamics, iterate on our plan, and take a series of actions guided by our principals. These actions included quickly stopping employee travel, and changing our approach to advisor conferences to avoid large group gatherings.  We also effectively moved over 90% of our staff to work from home while maintaining the high levels of service our advisors expect. To provide additional support for our employees through this period, we paid a cash bonus to those required to come to the office and for family members of employees who lost their jobs at other companies, we offered temporary roles and placement services. Remaining responsive to evolving conditions, we extended service hours to give our advisors more flexibility in their own work day.  Our research team also increased their level of support by providing around the clock updates, insights and forums to enrich our advisors guidance and communications as they work to keep their clients informed. And to help advisors lower trading cost, we added two more sponsors to our no transaction fee ETF platform. Through all of this, our systems were stable and resilient, handling up to seven times average daily trading volumes with no interruptions. We're pleased with how our organization quickly and nimbly solved problems and worked through challenges so our advisors could continue to focus on serving their clients. Advisor feedback indicates they appreciate we have maintained continuity in our business and the assistance we provided to help them manage their own transition into working in these new ways. More broadly, we also see the emergence of new ways of thinking that will come out of this period such as a more distributed workforce model, and the increased utilization of automation and artificial intelligence.  These structural trends are creating opportunities to evolve certain aspects of how we work and serve our advisors, which we are incorporating into our plans. As we look ahead, regardless of the shape of the recovery, we see an even greater need for our solutions and are better positioned than ever to serve our existing advisors and compete for additional market share. Given this, we remain focused on our three strategic plays, and I thought it might be helpful to share some color on our progress. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves winning in our traditional independent and institutional markets, while also expanding our affiliation models to compete in new markets.  With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to bring advisors onto our platform and grow our pipeline. Our differentiated capabilities, resilient platform and stable balance sheet are an even greater competitive advantage in this environment, which in turn is leading to increased interest from prospective advisors. To capitalize on this interest, our business development team has created alternative digital approaches in order to continue recruiting and onboarding prospective advisors. These capabilities also provide an interesting leverage point to increase our business development reach and efficiency going forward. Looking more closely at recent recruiting activity, January and February were some of our highest months of pipeline growth. Then in March, activity slowed as advisors focused on serving their clients through the market volatility and transitioning to work from home. As the climate stabilized in April, advisors had more time to work on the strategic elements of their business, and our pipeline growth returned to levels similar to January in February. As a result, April recruited assets were slightly above the monthly average in the first quarter, and our pipeline is now at the largest in its history. Our work on expanding our affiliation models in the advisory oriented and employee markets is progressing and starting to deliver results. In April, we officially launched our premium offering as LPL Strategic Wealth Services. And our first team joined and is now operating and serving clients on our platform. Later this quarter, we have additional advisors scheduled to join and our pipeline continues to expand. As for our independent employee offering, we are still on track with our plans to go-to-market at the end of this quarter. Across both the employee and independent channels, we're hearing solid interest from prospective advisors. We also continue to use M&A to complement organic growth. Earlier this week, we announced our acquisition of Lucia Securities, a San Diego based firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. This transaction will give Lucia's advisors access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service, and we look forward to them joining our platform later this year.  Our second strategic play involves creating an industry leading service experience that increases our ability to attract and retain advisors. The main components of this strategic play are investing to enhance and differentiate client works, transforming our service model into a client care model, and delivering instantaneous processing driven by robotics and artificial intelligence. As part of our service model transformation, we are now providing omni-channel capabilities to over 3000 of our advisors. This approach combines interactive voice recognition with skills based routing to ensure our advisors can easily connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Given the positive feedback we have heard from advisors, we plan to roll out these capabilities to the rest of our advisors over the next quarter. Our third strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the best businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced business solutions, digitized workflows, advisor focused capital solutions and lead generation. The last few months have reinforced the importance of this strategic play and the value we can bring to advisors as their business partners. We remain focused on digitizing the six primary advisor workflows, and are about halfway through this effort.  In the first quarter, we completed the end-to-end integration of the first workflow, which is turning prospects into clients. As a result, when an advisor generates a proposal, and then a prospective client accepts it, a click of a button now populates all proposal information into our new account system. This integration makes it much more efficient for advisors to turn prospects into clients as they grow their business. As we move forward, we continue to focus on innovative solutions that make it easier for advisors to run successful businesses through any market conditions.  In summary, the focused execution of our strategy over the past few years has enabled us to be a source of strength and support for advisors and their clients during a time of unique need. As we all look ahead and try to envision what the future may look like, we believe our continued execution of our strategy, combined with the learnings and insights we've gained in this climate, position us to shape new opportunities for even more advisors and their clients and to continue creating long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. \nMatt Audette: Alright, thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our first quarter results, I'd like to highlight some of our progress over the past few years to enhance both our business and financial strength. We invested in capabilities, technology and service with a focus on improving the support and experience of our advisors and their clients. These investments are some of the key factors that led to our record growth in more than doubling of our EBITDA to over 1 billion last year. Additionally, our growth combined with disciplined expense management increased our operating margins from the low 30% range to nearly 50%.  During the same period, we increase the stability and flexibility of our balance sheet through several debt refinancings, which resulted in lower interest expense, greater corporate liquidity, and longer term maturities, all while cutting our leverage ratio nearly in half. And perhaps most important of all, these steps positioned us to have an unwavering focus on supporting our advisors and their clients, which in turn, drove the highest level of organic growth in our history. And as we look ahead, while taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, we are even better positioned to drive long-term growth. With that, let's now turn to our first quarter results. At a high level, our Q1 results are another example of the resiliency of our business and financial model during volatile times. The combination of strong organic growth, natural hedges from client cash balances and trading and discipline expense management lead to EPS prior to intangibles of $2.06. This was up 7% from a year ago, and is the highest result in our history. Looking at our business results, we finished Q1 with total brokerage and advisory assets of 670 billion, down 12% from Q4, driven by the decline in equity markets, partially offset by organic growth. Total net new assets were 12.5 billion in Q1, or a 6.5% annualized growth rate. And within the quarter, as we look at the impact of COVID-19 on our growth, I would highlight that net new assets in March were 4.3 billion, our second best month ever. And as for the month of April, we have continued to see strengthen net new assets, which are trending to levels similar to the monthly average we saw in Q4. Now looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends this quarter. Advisory assets increased over 48% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory inflows of 12.5 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, centrally managed net new assets were 2.2 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate. Before moving on, I'd like to share one final item on net new assets. As you know, organic net new assets is a key metric in our industry, both to evaluate individual company performance and to compare growth rates across our space. So it is important that our net new asset definition reflects both the full organic growth we are generating and be comparable across companies. With that perspective, we evaluated our definition, as well as the prevalent practice of our peers. We found that while we do not include the combined contribution of dividends, interest and advisory fees, most firms do. In our business, these sources generate approximately 1.5% of asset growth per year.  So beginning in Q2, we will include these factors in our net new asset reporting. This update will more fully reflect our organic growth and make our results more comparable across the industry. We have provided historical data in our key metrics presentation. So you can see the net new assets generated from these sources. Now let's turn to our q1 financial results. Our top line growth continued as gross profit was 576 million, up 37 million or 7% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were 162 million, up 28 million from Q4. The increase was mostly driven by seasonally lower production bonus expense, as well as higher advisory fees and sales commissions.  Looking ahead to Q2, I would highlight that advisory fees are primarily priced off of prior quarter balances. So the impact of the decline we saw in equity markets in the first quarter will be fully reflected in our Q2 results. Moving on to asset based revenues, sponsor revenues were 134 million in Q1, up 1 million sequentially, driven by greater usage of our mutual fund and ETF no transaction fee platforms, partially offset by lower average assets. Turning to client cash revenues, they were 151 million, down 4 million or 3% from Q4. The decrease was driven by lower short-term interest rates, mostly offset by higher client cash balances. Looking more closely at cash balances, they were 48 billion at the end of Q1, up 14 billion sequentially, with nearly all or 13.6 billion of that increase coming in the month of March. When we look at April, cash balances have remained steady and have only declined slightly from the impact of advisory fee billings. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 195 basis points, down 27 basis points from Q4, mostly driven by the decline in short-term interest rates in March. Looking ahead to Q2, we thought it'd be helpful to provide some additional disclosure in light of the dynamic environment. So we have shared new insight into our fixed, variable and overflow balances as part of our key metrics presentation. We hope you find this helpful when thinking through how our ICA yield will vary in different environments. So given where balances and rates were at the end of Q1, we expect our Q2 ICA yield to be around 120 basis points. This assumes no further changes in interest rates, client rates or cash balances. Moving on to Q1 transaction fee revenues, they were 137 million, up 19 million sequentially, primarily driven by the increase in trading activity in March. As we look ahead, while transaction volumes were somewhat elevated in early April, they have now returned to levels similar to Q4. Given this, April transaction revenue was about 5 million higher than our Q4 monthly average. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was 223 million in Q1 or an annualized run rate of about 890 million. As we look ahead to the full year, I wanted to share some context on our spending plans. We remain focused on balancing expense discipline, with growth investments, especially as environments like this can provide some of the best opportunities to drive organic growth. And as a reminder, we started the year with a core G&A outlook range of 915 to 940 million, or a 5.5% to 8% growth rate from our 2019 levels. The increased investment is almost entirely dedicated to driving organic growth, both in our traditional markets like we saw in Q1, as well as in new markets. We have also sequenced our spending plans to build gradually through the year, which positions us to be flexible and dynamic, depending on how the year plays out and our Q1 expenses, with a run rate below the low end of our full year outlook range, further strengthens that position. So as we think about the environment we're in right now, as well as the organic growth results our investments are generating, we believe the best way to drive long-term shareholder value is by continuing to invest, though at a more modest level, given that, we are now planning for our full year core G&A to be in the lower half of our outlook range. That said, we will remain flexible and are prepared to adjust our spending up or down depending on how our growth opportunities and the macro evolve from here. Now turning back to Q1 promotional expenses, they were 57 million, up 6 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher advisor conference expense. Looking ahead, we have no large conferences in Q2, so we anticipate conference expenses will decrease by approximately 10 million sequentially. Moving on to capital management, while the current macro environment has been volatile, we continue to generate strong cash flow. Even if we look at scenarios where the macro deteriorates meaningfully from here, our cash flow would still be well in excess of our needs, including serving our advisors, investing for growth, and paying regular dividends. This positions us well to continue to deploy capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As for our approach to capital allocation, our framework is unchanged. We invest for organic growth, first and foremost, then pursue M&A opportunities where appropriate, and finally return excess capital to shareholders. And as we have discussed, we think this environment can provide us with even more opportunity to deploy capital for organic growth given the strength of our business and value proposition. This climate may also create more M&A opportunities, and our approach here remains the same. We are interested in firms that are aligned strategically, financially and operationally and we're starting to see opportunities materialize like the acquisition of Lucia Securities we announced earlier this week. They are firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. The transaction has an anticipated EBITDA purchase multiple of approximately six times and we expect it to close in the second half of this year. We are excited to welcome Lucia's advisors to the LPL family. As for capital returns to shareholders, in Q1 we repurchased 150 million of our shares and paid 20 million of regular dividends. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, and our increasing opportunities to deploy capital for growth, we paused our share repurchase program towards the end of Q1. We will revisit our plans as the macro stabilizes and we have more clarity on the path from here. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q1, including the best organic growth and earnings in our history. And as we look forward, we are excited about our opportunities to continue driving growth and creating long-term shareholder value.  With that operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon. So Matt, I wanted to start off with just a question on the ICA. Now really appreciate the enhanced disclosure on Slide 16 including the maturity schedule for the ICA contracts. Now this quarter to be unique although I would say that there was a broader industry trend and then you saw material uplift in cash and given cash has remained elevated in April, as you noted, and just some of the pressures of the long end. You still have your same 50% to 75% fixed target, but what's your appetite to deploy some of those floating balances today into fixed rate just given some of the pressures on the curve?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, so I think there's a few factors at play there. I mean, I think first with our approach to long-term. I think our target of 50% to 75%, overtime, still holds and still makes sense. I think the key here is really about reducing our sensitivity to short-term movements and interest rates. And while we're subject of course to the interest rate environment, having that flow through our financials over a much longer period of time, I think helps us focus on our advisors what makes most sense for them from an investment standpoint. I think when you look at the market today, Steve and I'm with \u2013 to your point on the amount of cash that is on balance sheets right now. Things are much, much different than for an understatement of the call I suspect than just a few months ago with short-term rates zero and the 10 year to your point at about 50 basis points.  And I think that combined with the amount of cash that's out there I think that just the demand in market for fixed rate contracts now, I think is pretty light. There's some demand in the kind of the short end of the fixed rate part of the curve, meaning in the one to two years zone, so that I think there might be tactical opportunities there. But I think broadly we're \u2013 for right now we're focused on really putting those balances more in floating contracts, but contracts with a spread. And on the \u2013 and I'm sure you saw it on the disclosure that you referred to it towards the end of the quarter, we put in place another $5 billion variable contract at a spread in the 20 to 25 basis point range, versus the kind of those overflow contracts that are kind of flat. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color about the environment right now, but I think the long-term strategy is really unchanged.\nSteven Chubak : Now thanks for that color Matt and maybe just switching over to question for Dan. I was hoping then that you could provide us with some updated thoughts or color on the M&A backdrop. You recently executed a deal. At the same time, we're also hearing just across the industry that a lot of the private players that employ much more leverage are feeling just increasing levels of stress and I was hoping you can give some context as to what \u2013 how the M&A opportunity is evolving for maybe some more transformational deals, and also how the perception of weaker balance sheets of your competitors is maybe enhancing your ability to recruit given some of the strong numbers that you saw in April.\nDan Arnold: Yeah, Steven, so there's a lot there. If I don't hit it all on the first try. You can just redirect me, but let's start with the M&A piece perhaps and I'll start from the strategic place, which is as you guys know, M&A continues to stay on our strategic radar. As a reminder first priority is the use of our capital to drive organic growth and then we use M&A as a complement. One of those opportunities we do see is with M&A across the small BDs and RIA segment of the marketplace. As you said, the Lucia transaction is a great example of that opportunity where we can create value for both the principals and advisors of those practice as we transition their business onto our platform. So we do continue to see an opportunity there. In environments like this we're coming out of them, we would anticipate based on what history would tell us is that there would be demand and opportunity for continued consolidation within that segment of the marketplace. And so, as we said in our remarks, we continue to look at that segment of the marketplace for opportunity.  I think with respect to the broader question you asked around transformational opportunities. I think that again, history would tell us that in times like this, where you've got a tougher macro conditions that potentially disrupt the overall economic drivers of firms. Yeah, add to that, perhaps leverage that they have, on their balance sheet creates tough conditions to have the capacity to continue to invest and thus drive those businesses in a meaningful way forward generating organic types of growth. And so I think we believe that with that as a backdrop, you will begin to see some potential conversations and dialogues about strategic pivots by those firms, absent some sort of V shaped recovery, and so again, I think we look at that in the same way we do with the other segment from an M&A standpoint is on our strategic radar. We look at it as a complement to organic growth. If it's aligned strategically, operationally and financially with our business, we would have an interest in having that type of dialogue. So hopefully that gives you some perspective, at least on the M&A landscape. I think if you flip over to the question that you were asking about value propositions relative to the competition. I alluded to the fact that it can be tough, given the macro conditions with a highly leveraged balance sheet and some of the financial drivers of your top line growth challenged in this type of environment. I think for us, we look at our model and just continue to invest in it to enrich the competitive appeal of that model through its capabilities, its services, its technology, we feel good about that baseline value that we offer today. I think when you come through an environment like this with our resiliency, stability and those capabilities and you add to that the continued capacity to invest, we think that creates a pretty appealing scenario and an alternative for advisors to consider. And we'll continue then to take that position of strength and explore those possibilities across the independent space and the new markets that we've talked about in terms of attracting new advisors to our platform. So we think that creates a pretty compelling alternative option and if you don't have those opportunities associated with your model, then it makes us a pretty tough team to beat.\nSteven Chubak : Well, that's great Dan and thanks for indulging my three part follow up if you will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hey guys, how are you. First question just around, I guess, organic growth. So in the past, we've seen a slowdown in net new asset growth during periods of market volatility. Obviously, your net new assets in March were really strong and comments about April also point to a much different \u2013 much more different picture than what we've seen in the past. I guess can you talk about sustainability of that growth, ability to convert the robust pipeline that you talked about into net new assets over the coming months and quarters. And I guess to what extent do you see your investments in tech and digital solutions as kind of a key differentiating factor at times of social distancing.\nDan Arnold: Yeah, so it's a great question Alex. Let me take a stab at that. And again you're welcome to ask a follow on if I don't cover all of that. I think the \u2013 with respect to sustaining that type of NNA growth, I think that is certainly our aspiration and one of our primary areas of focus. And I think coming into the quarter, we had a good trajectory on that organic growth. And in Q1, we continued that trend. So that's certainly a nice jumping off point. I think as you look forward, we believe that capacity to invest, the investments we've made over the past three years, give us a real strong positioning from a competitive appeal, as we talked about. And again, our ability to continue to invest we think will continue to extend that differentiation and that competitive advantage. I think, you also then match that with the resiliency of our platform and the ability we've had to serve and support our advisors through what is a challenging and tough environment and you take that baseline, you add that to it, you add the ability to invest in it. And again, that combination creates an interesting opportunity for us as we think about sustaining that organic growth, both across new store sales, but also across same store sales and retention. And so I think we're pretty encouraged when we look at that package of options, alternatives and levers that we can continue to drive that that trajectory and trend with respect to our NNA over time. So short answer is, yeah, we feel pretty good about our continued focus on sustaining that and our competitive advantages, options, alternatives and tools in order to do that.\nAlex Blostein : Thanks for that. \nDan Arnold: Yeah, you had a second part. I don't think I got you. \nAlex Blostein : No, I think you covered it pretty well. I think my second question was for Matt, also around ICA. I guess it was just hoping to get a little bit more color around, if there's any opportunity to expand the variable contract capacity to accommodate some of those overflow balances in order to pick up the 20 to 30 basis points spread.\nMatt Audette: Sure, I mean, I think if you just look at the additional disclosure we put in for the quarter, I think we've got most of them in there with a contract that we put in place at the end of this quarter of around 5 billion. So you've now got just under 3 billion in the overflow balances and I think that of course, we'll always look for opportunities. But I think over the long-term here, those balances are probably not going to be in cash for an extended period of time. So I think we feel pretty good between the fixed portfolio and the increase of the variable capacity by 5 billion this quarter. Again, there'll be tactical things that we're working on I think might improve that a little bit from here, but I think the bulk of it, we were happy to get done at the end of March.\nAlex Blostein : Great, thanks very much.\nMatt Audette: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good evening everyone and hope you're all staying healthy. I had a gal to Alex's first question on the impressive April credit assets. How are you actively recruiting new advisors without the ability to hold in person meetings? And it sounds like your business can survive pretty much using Zoom and Skype, probably better than your competitors.\nDan Arnold: Yeah, well, I'll speak for us. Look, we obviously make a big investment in recruiting and see it as a nice lever of organic growth. And if you look at over the last year, we've recruited 36 billion in assets and we feel good about the progress that we're making there in that ongoing trajectory. There's a couple of key drivers to that. It's certainly continuing to invest in the model and creating differentiated capabilities that create that competitive appeal that I talked about earlier. We feel good about that continued trend and the opportunity with some of the new capabilities we're delivering to continue to create a distinction there. And I think the second part is the efficacy of our business development team and their ability to continue to take what is a competitive differentiated solution and go effectively take that to the marketplace. And as you said, I think in the midst of March where \u2013 or I guess, the full force of the pandemic hit, it was quite disruptive to the typical and traditional recruiting processes that many of them were done in person.  And I think some of the work that we had done to automate and digitize a lot of the processes in the past were certainly the leverage points. But I think that that team's ability to really pull off and explore what were the options and alternatives and it'd be quite agile about different ways to solve where you couldn't travel or you couldn't have a home office visit or you couldn't go visit an office and bring them on board and help them transition into the platform. Then we created digitized tools to overcome those things so that we could continue our activities. And though, as we said March had an impact in terms of the overall recruiting. We did see some deals get pushed back into second quarter because of some of that complexity. We were able to mitigate some of those challenges with these digitized capabilities, and we'll continue to leverage them going forward. And they accentuate our opportunity set in April as we're seeing in some cases where we use a digitized means to onboard someone, creating a faster ramp up in assets than we've seen traditionally. So there's some cool possibilities there that we'll continue to work on, we'll refine, we still have things to learn. But it's all in the spirit of continuously getting better.\nCraig Siegenthaler : If we split that strong March net new asset number into same store sales and new store sales contribution, do you know the rough mix and was there any change in composition in March versus what you saw in January and February?\nDan Arnold: Yeah, maybe I'll take a stab at that first. And I'll let Matt give you some additional color. I think if you if you look, interestingly at the trends, you would have seen some stronger new store sales at the beginning of the quarter, that had some impact in March as the pandemic sort of took and created a bigger impact. I think, contrary to that same store sales actually strengthened through the quarter as the value proposition of these advisors providing insight and perspective both when the engagement was good beginning of the quarter, but the sentiment was positive, as well as in March where sentiment had completely changed, but again the engagement was still strong as there was a lot to help clients with in terms of how they think about their financial futures and their life goals and dreams. And so, we actually saw same store sales build throughout the quarter. Do you want to put a higher capstone on that? \nMatt Audette: No, I was going to say same thing. So you summarized it well.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Great, thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you very much and appreciate the extra disclosure, super helpful, but was doing okay. Maybe Dan, one for you perhaps just structurally and maybe it's too soon. You and your peers have seen just a tremendous spike in cash and like others you're sort of seeing a relatively steady state in April, despite the markets bouncing back. Do you think we've reached some kind of point where cash becomes a higher percentage of client assets all else being equal? What's your sense in your conversations in the field?\nDan Arnold: Yeah, it's a really great question Bill. And it is early. We can look to history as a way to \u2013 as one source of data to think about that question. I think you can also look to human behavior and when you go through an impact like this, what sort of ongoing tail impact does it have on how people think about an allocation or even advisors allocations? My sense of it is this. I do believe you'll see cash in just more normalized market environments i.e. less volatility. You'll see more money get put back to work. Do we return to those 4% cash as a percentage of overall asset levels? I'm not sure, I think that's on the backs of a long sustained bull market and probably have more risk taking appetite than the one normally might. So as you think about the 4% range in assets that we jumped off of, to now it's roughly 7% of total assets. I think historically says you live in a five to six range and that may be a reasonable way to think about this over the long-term, acknowledging that there's lots of data to collect and more time to play out, but that might be a framework, at least of which to enrich your thinking.\nBill Katz : Okay, thank you for that. And my second question, I'm going to heat to a little bit of two parter, a little bit desperate, so I apologize. Can you give us an update on business solutions and how those conversations may have been evolving, particularly with just sort of the acceleration of volatility in the second quarter \u2013 in the first quarter? And then Matt maybe one for you, just going back to your decision to sort of slow \u2013 pause the buyback, how much of that is truly from the macro versus building M&A pipeline? Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. So I'll take the business solutions first Bill and then I'll turn it over to Matt. So look, it's just for everyone, as a reminder, the business solutions is really about providing access to expertise and affordable way to help advisors operate their businesses. And in Q1 we had good momentum to start the quarter. The fundamental value proposition continues to resonate with our advisors. And we saw our subscriber base grow to around 700 in the first quarter, which is up roughly 50 over fourth quarter, so that's all a good solid baseline and we feel good about that. Certainly when COVID arrived, we saw two things that maybe are worth noting. The first is the advisors who were in the pipeline to potentially set up a subscription and begin to use one of those services, that progress slowed as they rightfully shifted their focus over to serving and supporting their clients and not it's prioritizing sort of starting something new. And I think that creates some short-term headwind in terms of working through that. We also cancelled some conferences that we would have typically used as sales forums for business solutions.  So we have to find other ways of which to consistently offer those types of solutions, which we do, but those are just sometimes centre pieces to how we offer those types of solutions in Q1. So that has a bit of a headwind as well. I think more on the favorable side of it, though the advisors that are using these services, given the complexity of the operating environment in the first quarter, the value of these solutions was magnified, whether it was the marketing solutions, not just helping them with lead generation, but helping them manage their client communications in a really intense time where the CFO solutions helping them with business stress testing or cash flow analysis and evaluations, the tech solutions where we actually came up with a really cool creative, turnkey remote office solution within literally two weeks, within the quarter to again, help advisors and working from home and making that simpler and easier. So it really does reinforce the value these solutions offered to the advisors. So, again, we were excited about the long-term opportunity set and the value they create. You just got some short-term headwinds that we've had to work through. Matt, you want to take the second part of it. \nMatt Audette: Yeah, I think Bill on the repurchase program pause, I mean, the thing I would emphasize most is when we look at our organic growth and our value proposition, having a strong balance sheet is just critical and supportive of that. So being able to manage through a downturn like this, while continuing to generate cash, to have low leverage ratios compared to others in the space, to not being a bank with the risks that come along with being a bank and needing capital to support it and having losses associated with loans. I could go on and on, right. So I think those things are really, really important. So when you look at continuing to do share purchases in an environment like this, we really balance that against being able to have that strong balance sheet and being able to support everything that we need, so I think it's out of an abundance of caution. I think kind of getting more clarity on where the macro goes from here I think we'll help on that front. So I think that's the primary thing. I think when you look at M&A, I think those opportunities are there and interesting. I think Dan described that well. The only thing I would add is just the reminder M&A, you've got a lot of clarity on the EBITDA that comes with that. And given our price discipline there, it's not \u2013 unless you're talking large, large deals. That's not typically a big user of leverage given our price discipline combined with the EBITDA that'll come along. So hopefully that helps you get a little perspective or color on our perspective.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jeffries. You may proceed with your question.\nGerry O'Hara: Great, and thanks for taking my questions this afternoon or this evening potentially. The centrally managed portfolios, obviously a very strong NNA growth continues. Just trying to get a sense around sort of the adoption from advisors of this program and kind of where you might see it trending on a go forward basis. Is it sort of wholly adopted by the advisors at this point? Is it sort of still in an evolutionary stage or what is it that's continuing to drive this strong NNA growth going forward.\nDan Arnold: Now, let me give you a little color on that. Again, Matt, if you want to add anything behind that. So look, if I took at a high level, I think you're in the earlier part of the nine innings game in terms of the adoption and utilization of centrally managed solutions. And I think the continued investment we make in the capabilities, the flexibility, the optionality we give the advisors, the improvement and user interfaces all will help support and drive the continued use of centrally managed platforms. I think we recognized there's more innovation out there for us to work on and add to those centrally managed solutions, such that you've got terrific investment options and strategies that help those advisors create and add value to their clients. You can do it in a highly simplified, digitized way that gives access to the advisor to kind of take their hands on and off the wheel is a really interesting appealing package of value to those advisors. As we continue to evolve our capabilities there, we think there's a correlation between the evolution of those capabilities and the utilization of the centrally managed platforms.  What's driving it? I think advisors more and more recognize and look for that it can be a great leverage point their overall practice and as they try to either lower their costs or create more flexibility to reallocate their time to more valuable activities, I think this becomes a more and more appealing type of concept that they can use as a leverage point to their practices. So we create a really appealing solution. Their need for will only evolve and grow as they look for more leverage points in their practice, that's we think, a nice combination to drive a long sustainable trend, which is why we say it's in the early parts of the game. I don't know if Matt, you want to add anything to that? \nMatt Audette: No, I think that was well said.\nGerry O'Hara : That's helpful and I guess one for Matt specifically and I apologies if I missed this or if there was a read through it is perhaps somewhat clear, but I guess intuitively promotional expenses would likely come in, in the current coming quarters, assuming all else equal with the current backdrop. But one, I guess, can you perhaps kind of confirm that statement? And then two, have you kind of thought about ways to perhaps \u2013 I don't know if this is impossible, but digitize if you will, that this sort of activity or if there's sort of virtual capabilities that will enable you to kind of continue down the road of certain promotional activities.\nMatt Audette: Yeah, sure, Gerry, I mean, I think on both of those the promotional expenses in Q2, we have very few, if any conferences, so they'll come down specific to the conference piece of that by about 10 million. So there's definitely a decline there. On the second part of your question, I'll just give a little bit of the financial ends and then Dan, if you want to jump in. But our national conference, our largest conference of the year is in Q3 and we have already decided to move that to a virtual conference. So we are in the planning stages of that. So I think to answer the question it's definitely possible. We are in the middle of working on that. And obviously, Dan's in a better spot to give some color on that than me. \nDan Arnold: Yeah, so obviously, pulling together 8,000 to 9,000 people in July doesn't sound like a great risk to take given the backdrop and so we announced that we would shift this to a virtual conference. A lot of folks are working on that same concept. There's again, some interesting technologies and cool ways of which to share that content in a more digital platform. And so we're working through exactly how we would do that, the cost associated with doing that, working with sponsors to be a part of that overall program, so more to come on that. But I think Matt's right, as we think about third quarter and that being our largest conference. As we get through the other side of that and would expect you to see some shift or change in the overall economics around focus on our big conference.\nGerry O'Hara : Okay. Great, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, great, good evening, guys. First question here just on upfront contracts in the industry, obviously had seen kind of those scaling up in recent years just as there's quite a bit of competition and also your firms have the benefit of higher interest rates that was maybe supporting some of that spending or investment if you will. With interest rates and equity markets abruptly moving lower, I guess what are you guys seeing with upfront recruiting packages? I appreciate it's probably early. And whether you guys expect to hold the line, which would maybe further accelerate organic growth or potentially would you move that lower, which would make the recruiting economics even more attractive, assuming the organic growth remains strong to kind of think about how that may affect things moving forward?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, Devin, I mean, I think on the way we approach that is really a change. We changed, we adjusted our approach a couple of years ago, just underwrite to returns. We're continuing to underwrite those returns. We've never put into those models any sanguine view, if you will, on the macro, so we'll update based on the environment we're in that could buy things down a little bit, but I would \u2013 as a general rule, but each deal is individually underwritten dependent on the mix of that firm and what products and services they use, but we'll continue to underwrite returns, so no change there.\nDevin Ryan : Got it, very helpful and then just to follow up on customer cash, appreciate all the detail in the presentation and the commentary on the ICA portfolio. With respect to the DCA piece, you guys updated the fee schedule. And just trying to think about whether there's more room to do that and kind of the inputs to do that, just trying to think whether there might be some additional opportunity for that piece as well kind of down the road here.\nMatt Audette: Yeah, I mean, I think when you think about that product, it's one word to fee per account. So the balances in there kind of \u2013 are the \u2013 drive the overall economics. So I think that the changes that we made that you referred to are based on where those balances are. And I think if that changes over the long-term that could impact things. But I think we feel like with the adjustments we've made that that product is in the right spot and a competitive spot for the clients that have investors in there.\nDevin Ryan : Okay, great. Leave it there. Thanks, guys. \nDan Arnold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good evening. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts if you think there might be a longer term impact of COVID-19 on the wealth management business, either the way that advisors will manage their relationships or work from home or something else that really changes the efficiency of the advisor in their business.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. So Ken, I think there's no doubt this will create some structural change across the market and the industry and I think probably history again tells us the magnitude that change will likely be driven by the desire of individual firms and how much they want to embrace and pull that change through. And we entered this environment with \u2013 as I said earlier, where we established some principles that drove how we think about this opportunity. And that starts with taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and also at the same time protecting the health and safety of our employees. So those principles drove our thinking, our decision making through this and actually, given this significant change across both of those spectrums, there's a tremendous amount of learning opportunity that sits inside that change, right, which took us to the next place we went to in managing through this was our culture and our values. And one of our values is a commitment to learning and applying that learning to drive innovation in an agile way.  And so in a climate like this, where we talked about this significant change, we believe it creates an incredible opportunity to learn and apply that learning going forward to drive real structural differences in the business. And I think you hit on in the spirit of brevity one of those examples, which would be how people think about a distributed workforce. And what does that mean as you apply that to 4,500 employees in our case or nearly 17,000 advisors and how we support engage with them or even as you said, how we \u2013 how they would engage in, in millions of their clients. And so we believe there's a real ripe opportunity that this creates an opening of which to think about things in a different way and opens up the playing field, if you will, do experimentation, to do things that you may never have done otherwise. There could be jobs that you didn't think were possible to do remotely from home that all of a sudden by doing it, you now have a different point of view on that and that shapes how you think about managing your workforce, flexible schedules, how you access talent and even how you manage your real estate portfolio.  And that's just one example, right, that sits inside that structural changes suggested. We believe the whole use of robotics, AI and digital tools will be different going forward, people's thinking around outsourcing and supply chains will be changed forever by this if they have a desire to pull that through. And I think we're looking at it those things and more, really challenging ourselves to make sure we lean into the learning opportunities, and how you may pull through those changes to reshape your cost structure, to reshape how you engage with your employees all the way to how you position your advisors to deliver a different client experience to their client. So that's the spectrum of opportunity we kind of see coming out of this. There will be more to emerge. It's early. We've got a lot to learn, but we're trying to be purposeful about getting our arms around as much as that isn't cancer and be thoughtful and having an informed view is the best way forward.\nKen Worthington : Great, well, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.\nChris Shutler: Hey, guys, hope you're all doing well. To follow up on Devin's question from earlier. How does the change in the interest rate environment affect what you're willing to pay for advisory assets? Are you underwriting a much lower Fed funds rate today, given the environment or when you think about TA do you kind of structure it in the hopes that rates bounce back?\nMatt Audette: Yeah. Great, Chris. So we \u2013 I think I use my SAP word. We're not sanguine on the macro in the earlier answer. So we don't assume any improvement in macro. We underwrite to returns in the current environment that means the current interest rate environment. And then based on again, each deal is individually underwritten. And we say disciplined on that, I mean, undirected returns.\nChris Shutler : Okay, fair enough. And then just a second one, just a small question on the conferences, since you're going to be doing those virtually this year, I think you mentioned the $10 million reduction in conference expense from Q1 to Q2, anything you can say about the remainder of the year and how both revenue and expenses will be impacted?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, I think the Q2 reduction is really just based on the timing of conferences, which this year are planned primarily for Q1 and Q3. I think in Q3 where we have our focus conference that Dan talked about a little bit earlier, going virtual, I think just to give you a sense that conference is typically around 15 million in costs and around 5 million or 6 million in sponsor revenues. So I think as we approach moving to a virtual conference, I think we'll think through how those expenses evolve. You'll have obvious things like travel expenses, there won't be any rights that'll bring cost down, but at the same time, we're focused on investing in the virtual areas of the digital capabilities of that conference to make it something that's compelling and helpful, for the very reasons that we do that conference, right. So we're in the planning stages now. We'll give you an update next quarter in Q2, so you have a sense as to our best estimate as to what's coming in Q3 then.\nChris Shutler : Okay, thanks a lot.\nDan Arnold: Thank you. And hey, thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you.

Before I review our first quarter results, I'd like to highlight some of our progress over the past few years to enhance both our business and financial strength. We invested in capabilities, technology and service with a focus on improving the support and experience of our advisors and their clients. These investments are some of the key factors that led to our record growth in more than doubling of our EBITDA to over 1 billion last year. Additionally, our growth combined with disciplined expense management increased our operating margins from the low 30% range to nearly 50%.  During the same period, we increase the stability and flexibility of our balance sheet through several debt refinancings, which resulted in lower interest expense, greater corporate liquidity, and longer term maturities, all while cutting our leverage ratio nearly in half. And perhaps most important of all, these steps positioned us to have an unwavering focus on supporting our advisors and their clients, which in turn, drove the highest level of organic growth in our history. And as we look ahead, while taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, we are even better positioned to drive long-term growth. With that, let's now turn to our first quarter results. At a high level, our Q1 results are another example of the resiliency of our business and financial model during volatile times. The combination of strong organic growth, natural hedges from client cash balances and trading and discipline expense management lead to EPS prior to intangibles of $2.06. This was up 7% from a year ago, and is the highest result in our history. Looking at our business results, we finished Q1 with total brokerage and advisory assets of 670 billion, down 12% from Q4, driven by the decline in equity markets, partially offset by organic growth. Total net new assets were 12.5 billion in Q1, or a 6.5% annualized growth rate. And within the quarter, as we look at the impact of COVID-19 on our growth, I would highlight that net new assets in March were 4.3 billion, our second best month ever. And as for the month of April, we have continued to see strengthen net new assets, which are trending to levels similar to the monthly average we saw in Q4. Now looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends this quarter. Advisory assets increased over 48% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory inflows of 12.5 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, centrally managed net new assets were 2.2 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate. Before moving on, I'd like to share one final item on net new assets. As you know, organic net new assets is a key metric in our industry, both to evaluate individual company performance and to compare growth rates across our space. So it is important that our net new asset definition reflects both the full organic growth we are generating and be comparable across companies. With that perspective, we evaluated our definition, as well as the prevalent practice of our peers. We found that while we do not include the combined contribution of dividends, interest and advisory fees, most firms do. In our business, these sources generate approximately 1.5% of asset growth per year.  So beginning in Q2, we will include these factors in our net new asset reporting. This update will more fully reflect our organic growth and make our results more comparable across the industry. We have provided historical data in our key metrics presentation. So you can see the net new assets generated from these sources. Now let's turn to our q1 financial results. Our top line growth continued as gross profit was 576 million, up 37 million or 7% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were 162 million, up 28 million from Q4. The increase was mostly driven by seasonally lower production bonus expense, as well as higher advisory fees and sales commissions.  Looking ahead to Q2, I would highlight that advisory fees are primarily priced off of prior quarter balances. So the impact of the decline we saw in equity markets in the first quarter will be fully reflected in our Q2 results. Moving on to asset based revenues, sponsor revenues were 134 million in Q1, up 1 million sequentially, driven by greater usage of our mutual fund and ETF no transaction fee platforms, partially offset by lower average assets. Turning to client cash revenues, they were 151 million, down 4 million or 3% from Q4. The decrease was driven by lower short-term interest rates, mostly offset by higher client cash balances. Looking more closely at cash balances, they were 48 billion at the end of Q1, up 14 billion sequentially, with nearly all or 13.6 billion of that increase coming in the month of March. When we look at April, cash balances have remained steady and have only declined slightly from the impact of advisory fee billings. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 195 basis points, down 27 basis points from Q4, mostly driven by the decline in short-term interest rates in March. Looking ahead to Q2, we thought it'd be helpful to provide some additional disclosure in light of the dynamic environment. So we have shared new insight into our fixed, variable and overflow balances as part of our key metrics presentation. We hope you find this helpful when thinking through how our ICA yield will vary in different environments. So given where balances and rates were at the end of Q1, we expect our Q2 ICA yield to be around 120 basis points. This assumes no further changes in interest rates, client rates or cash balances. Moving on to Q1 transaction fee revenues, they were 137 million, up 19 million sequentially, primarily driven by the increase in trading activity in March. As we look ahead, while transaction volumes were somewhat elevated in early April, they have now returned to levels similar to Q4. Given this, April transaction revenue was about 5 million higher than our Q4 monthly average. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was 223 million in Q1 or an annualized run rate of about 890 million. As we look ahead to the full year, I wanted to share some context on our spending plans. We remain focused on balancing expense discipline, with growth investments, especially as environments like this can provide some of the best opportunities to drive organic growth. And as a reminder, we started the year with a core G&A outlook range of 915 to 940 million, or a 5.5% to 8% growth rate from our 2019 levels. The increased investment is almost entirely dedicated to driving organic growth, both in our traditional markets like we saw in Q1, as well as in new markets. We have also sequenced our spending plans to build gradually through the year, which positions us to be flexible and dynamic, depending on how the year plays out and our Q1 expenses, with a run rate below the low end of our full year outlook range, further strengthens that position. So as we think about the environment we're in right now, as well as the organic growth results our investments are generating, we believe the best way to drive long-term shareholder value is by continuing to invest, though at a more modest level, given that, we are now planning for our full year core G&A to be in the lower half of our outlook range. That said, we will remain flexible and are prepared to adjust our spending up or down depending on how our growth opportunities and the macro evolve from here. Now turning back to Q1 promotional expenses, they were 57 million, up 6 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher advisor conference expense. Looking ahead, we have no large conferences in Q2, so we anticipate conference expenses will decrease by approximately 10 million sequentially. Moving on to capital management, while the current macro environment has been volatile, we continue to generate strong cash flow. Even if we look at scenarios where the macro deteriorates meaningfully from here, our cash flow would still be well in excess of our needs, including serving our advisors, investing for growth, and paying regular dividends. This positions us well to continue to deploy capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As for our approach to capital allocation, our framework is unchanged. We invest for organic growth, first and foremost, then pursue M&A opportunities where appropriate, and finally return excess capital to shareholders. And as we have discussed, we think this environment can provide us with even more opportunity to deploy capital for organic growth given the strength of our business and value proposition. This climate may also create more M&A opportunities, and our approach here remains the same. We are interested in firms that are aligned strategically, financially and operationally and we're starting to see opportunities materialize like the acquisition of Lucia Securities we announced earlier this week. They are firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. The transaction has an anticipated EBITDA purchase multiple of approximately six times and we expect it to close in the second half of this year. We are excited to welcome Lucia's advisors to the LPL family. As for capital returns to shareholders, in Q1 we repurchased 150 million of our shares and paid 20 million of regular dividends. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, and our increasing opportunities to deploy capital for growth, we paused our share repurchase program towards the end of Q1. We will revisit our plans as the macro stabilizes and we have more clarity on the path from here. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q1, including the best organic growth and earnings in our history. And as we look forward, we are excited about our opportunities to continue driving growth and creating long-term shareholder value.  With that operator, please open the call for questions. Yeah, so I think there's a few factors at play there. I mean, I think first with our approach to long-term. I think our target of 50% to 75%, overtime, still holds and still makes sense. I think the key here is really about reducing our sensitivity to short-term movements and interest rates. And while we're subject of course to the interest rate environment, having that flow through our financials over a much longer period of time, I think helps us focus on our advisors what makes most sense for them from an investment standpoint. I think when you look at the market today, Steve and I'm with \u2013 to your point on the amount of cash that is on balance sheets right now. Things are much, much different than for an understatement of the call I suspect than just a few months ago with short-term rates zero and the 10 year to your point at about 50 basis points.  And I think that combined with the amount of cash that's out there I think that just the demand in market for fixed rate contracts now, I think is pretty light. There's some demand in the kind of the short end of the fixed rate part of the curve, meaning in the one to two years zone, so that I think there might be tactical opportunities there. But I think broadly we're \u2013 for right now we're focused on really putting those balances more in floating contracts, but contracts with a spread. And on the \u2013 and I'm sure you saw it on the disclosure that you referred to it towards the end of the quarter, we put in place another $5 billion variable contract at a spread in the 20 to 25 basis point range, versus the kind of those overflow contracts that are kind of flat. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color about the environment right now, but I think the long-term strategy is really unchanged. Sure, I mean, I think if you just look at the additional disclosure we put in for the quarter, I think we've got most of them in there with a contract that we put in place at the end of this quarter of around 5 billion. So you've now got just under 3 billion in the overflow balances and I think that of course, we'll always look for opportunities. But I think over the long-term here, those balances are probably not going to be in cash for an extended period of time. So I think we feel pretty good between the fixed portfolio and the increase of the variable capacity by 5 billion this quarter. Again, there'll be tactical things that we're working on I think might improve that a little bit from here, but I think the bulk of it, we were happy to get done at the end of March. You bet. No, I was going to say same thing. So you summarized it well. Yeah, I think Bill on the repurchase program pause, I mean, the thing I would emphasize most is when we look at our organic growth and our value proposition, having a strong balance sheet is just critical and supportive of that. So being able to manage through a downturn like this, while continuing to generate cash, to have low leverage ratios compared to others in the space, to not being a bank with the risks that come along with being a bank and needing capital to support it and having losses associated with loans. I could go on and on, right. So I think those things are really, really important. So when you look at continuing to do share purchases in an environment like this, we really balance that against being able to have that strong balance sheet and being able to support everything that we need, so I think it's out of an abundance of caution. I think kind of getting more clarity on where the macro goes from here I think we'll help on that front. So I think that's the primary thing. I think when you look at M&A, I think those opportunities are there and interesting. I think Dan described that well. The only thing I would add is just the reminder M&A, you've got a lot of clarity on the EBITDA that comes with that. And given our price discipline there, it's not \u2013 unless you're talking large, large deals. That's not typically a big user of leverage given our price discipline combined with the EBITDA that'll come along. So hopefully that helps you get a little perspective or color on our perspective. No, I think that was well said. Yeah, sure, Gerry, I mean, I think on both of those the promotional expenses in Q2, we have very few, if any conferences, so they'll come down specific to the conference piece of that by about 10 million. So there's definitely a decline there. On the second part of your question, I'll just give a little bit of the financial ends and then Dan, if you want to jump in. But our national conference, our largest conference of the year is in Q3 and we have already decided to move that to a virtual conference. So we are in the planning stages of that. So I think to answer the question it's definitely possible. We are in the middle of working on that. And obviously, Dan's in a better spot to give some color on that than me. Yeah, Devin, I mean, I think on the way we approach that is really a change. We changed, we adjusted our approach a couple of years ago, just underwrite to returns. We're continuing to underwrite those returns. We've never put into those models any sanguine view, if you will, on the macro, so we'll update based on the environment we're in that could buy things down a little bit, but I would \u2013 as a general rule, but each deal is individually underwritten dependent on the mix of that firm and what products and services they use, but we'll continue to underwrite returns, so no change there. Yeah, I mean, I think when you think about that product, it's one word to fee per account. So the balances in there kind of \u2013 are the \u2013 drive the overall economics. So I think that the changes that we made that you referred to are based on where those balances are. And I think if that changes over the long-term that could impact things. But I think we feel like with the adjustments we've made that that product is in the right spot and a competitive spot for the clients that have investors in there. Yeah. Great, Chris. So we \u2013 I think I use my SAP word. We're not sanguine on the macro in the earlier answer. So we don't assume any improvement in macro. We underwrite to returns in the current environment that means the current interest rate environment. And then based on again, each deal is individually underwritten. And we say disciplined on that, I mean, undirected returns. Yeah, I think the Q2 reduction is really just based on the timing of conferences, which this year are planned primarily for Q1 and Q3. I think in Q3 where we have our focus conference that Dan talked about a little bit earlier, going virtual, I think just to give you a sense that conference is typically around 15 million in costs and around 5 million or 6 million in sponsor revenues. So I think as we approach moving to a virtual conference, I think we'll think through how those expenses evolve. You'll have obvious things like travel expenses, there won't be any rights that'll bring cost down, but at the same time, we're focused on investing in the virtual areas of the digital capabilities of that conference to make it something that's compelling and helpful, for the very reasons that we do that conference, right. So we're in the planning stages now. We'll give you an update next quarter in Q2, so you have a sense as to our best estimate as to what's coming in Q3 then."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, the COVID-19 virus has altered both the economy and our daily lives. Given this, I first want to thank our employees for their remarkable hard work and commitment to supporting our advisors over the past few months. And I also want to thank our advisors for continuing to provide financial guidance to millions of Americans at a time when it is needed most. More broadly, after executing on our strategy over the past several years, we have built an organization that not only performs well in good environments, but also excels in challenging times to provide strength for advisors and their clients. As we look ahead, we envision an even greater number of advisors and their clients seeking not only advice, but also the capabilities and stability LPL can provide. We are well positioned to meet this growing need and increase our market leadership. In that spirit, today I'm going to focus our discussion on three areas; first, our position and momentum entering this climate; second, how we are executing our COVID-19 contingency plans and finally, how we are driving the business forward from here.  Now, over the past several years with a focus on serving our advisors and their clients, we have built a robust and resilient operating platform, innovated on differentiated capabilities and enhanced our service experience. At the same time, we increased our balance sheet capacity and stability, which positions us to continue investing in a broad range of macro environments. This combination of business and financial strength has made our model more appealing in the marketplace and lead to positive momentum and higher levels of growth. We saw all of this reflected in our first quarter results. Organic growth continued to increase in the first quarter as net new assets totaled 12.5 billion, which translates to a 6.5% annualized growth rate. This is the highest level we have recorded and up from 4.9% in the prior quarter, as new store sales, same store sales and retention all increased on a sequential basis. Looking more closely at new store sales, recruited assets were 8.4 billion in the first quarter and 36 billion over the past year. Turning to our financial results, first quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $2.06, which was up 7% from a year ago.  With respect to results around the advisory experience, I want to highlight two key indicators of our progress in this area. First, our advisor Net Promoter scores increased by another nine points in Q1 for a total increase of roughly 55 points in just over two years. Second, annualized production retention was a new high of 99% in the first quarter. As we look ahead, we will continue to work to drive favorable outcomes like these by investing in capabilities and technology, transforming our service model and attracting and developing extraordinary talent with our mission driven culture. Now, let's move to how we are executing our contingency plans for COVID-19. We first identified the principles that mattered most to guide our efforts, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and protecting the health of our employees. We then used a data driven agile approach to work through this effort. Our Management Committee met daily to assess the changing dynamics, iterate on our plan, and take a series of actions guided by our principals. These actions included quickly stopping employee travel, and changing our approach to advisor conferences to avoid large group gatherings.  We also effectively moved over 90% of our staff to work from home while maintaining the high levels of service our advisors expect. To provide additional support for our employees through this period, we paid a cash bonus to those required to come to the office and for family members of employees who lost their jobs at other companies, we offered temporary roles and placement services. Remaining responsive to evolving conditions, we extended service hours to give our advisors more flexibility in their own work day.  Our research team also increased their level of support by providing around the clock updates, insights and forums to enrich our advisors guidance and communications as they work to keep their clients informed. And to help advisors lower trading cost, we added two more sponsors to our no transaction fee ETF platform. Through all of this, our systems were stable and resilient, handling up to seven times average daily trading volumes with no interruptions. We're pleased with how our organization quickly and nimbly solved problems and worked through challenges so our advisors could continue to focus on serving their clients. Advisor feedback indicates they appreciate we have maintained continuity in our business and the assistance we provided to help them manage their own transition into working in these new ways. More broadly, we also see the emergence of new ways of thinking that will come out of this period such as a more distributed workforce model, and the increased utilization of automation and artificial intelligence.  These structural trends are creating opportunities to evolve certain aspects of how we work and serve our advisors, which we are incorporating into our plans. As we look ahead, regardless of the shape of the recovery, we see an even greater need for our solutions and are better positioned than ever to serve our existing advisors and compete for additional market share. Given this, we remain focused on our three strategic plays, and I thought it might be helpful to share some color on our progress. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves winning in our traditional independent and institutional markets, while also expanding our affiliation models to compete in new markets.  With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to bring advisors onto our platform and grow our pipeline. Our differentiated capabilities, resilient platform and stable balance sheet are an even greater competitive advantage in this environment, which in turn is leading to increased interest from prospective advisors. To capitalize on this interest, our business development team has created alternative digital approaches in order to continue recruiting and onboarding prospective advisors. These capabilities also provide an interesting leverage point to increase our business development reach and efficiency going forward. Looking more closely at recent recruiting activity, January and February were some of our highest months of pipeline growth. Then in March, activity slowed as advisors focused on serving their clients through the market volatility and transitioning to work from home. As the climate stabilized in April, advisors had more time to work on the strategic elements of their business, and our pipeline growth returned to levels similar to January in February. As a result, April recruited assets were slightly above the monthly average in the first quarter, and our pipeline is now at the largest in its history. Our work on expanding our affiliation models in the advisory oriented and employee markets is progressing and starting to deliver results. In April, we officially launched our premium offering as LPL Strategic Wealth Services. And our first team joined and is now operating and serving clients on our platform. Later this quarter, we have additional advisors scheduled to join and our pipeline continues to expand. As for our independent employee offering, we are still on track with our plans to go-to-market at the end of this quarter. Across both the employee and independent channels, we're hearing solid interest from prospective advisors. We also continue to use M&A to complement organic growth. Earlier this week, we announced our acquisition of Lucia Securities, a San Diego based firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. This transaction will give Lucia's advisors access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service, and we look forward to them joining our platform later this year.  Our second strategic play involves creating an industry leading service experience that increases our ability to attract and retain advisors. The main components of this strategic play are investing to enhance and differentiate client works, transforming our service model into a client care model, and delivering instantaneous processing driven by robotics and artificial intelligence. As part of our service model transformation, we are now providing omni-channel capabilities to over 3000 of our advisors. This approach combines interactive voice recognition with skills based routing to ensure our advisors can easily connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Given the positive feedback we have heard from advisors, we plan to roll out these capabilities to the rest of our advisors over the next quarter. Our third strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the best businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced business solutions, digitized workflows, advisor focused capital solutions and lead generation. The last few months have reinforced the importance of this strategic play and the value we can bring to advisors as their business partners. We remain focused on digitizing the six primary advisor workflows, and are about halfway through this effort.  In the first quarter, we completed the end-to-end integration of the first workflow, which is turning prospects into clients. As a result, when an advisor generates a proposal, and then a prospective client accepts it, a click of a button now populates all proposal information into our new account system. This integration makes it much more efficient for advisors to turn prospects into clients as they grow their business. As we move forward, we continue to focus on innovative solutions that make it easier for advisors to run successful businesses through any market conditions.  In summary, the focused execution of our strategy over the past few years has enabled us to be a source of strength and support for advisors and their clients during a time of unique need. As we all look ahead and try to envision what the future may look like, we believe our continued execution of our strategy, combined with the learnings and insights we've gained in this climate, position us to shape new opportunities for even more advisors and their clients and to continue creating long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yeah, Steven, so there's a lot there. If I don't hit it all on the first try. You can just redirect me, but let's start with the M&A piece perhaps and I'll start from the strategic place, which is as you guys know, M&A continues to stay on our strategic radar. As a reminder first priority is the use of our capital to drive organic growth and then we use M&A as a complement. One of those opportunities we do see is with M&A across the small BDs and RIA segment of the marketplace. As you said, the Lucia transaction is a great example of that opportunity where we can create value for both the principals and advisors of those practice as we transition their business onto our platform. So we do continue to see an opportunity there. In environments like this we're coming out of them, we would anticipate based on what history would tell us is that there would be demand and opportunity for continued consolidation within that segment of the marketplace. And so, as we said in our remarks, we continue to look at that segment of the marketplace for opportunity.  I think with respect to the broader question you asked around transformational opportunities. I think that again, history would tell us that in times like this, where you've got a tougher macro conditions that potentially disrupt the overall economic drivers of firms. Yeah, add to that, perhaps leverage that they have, on their balance sheet creates tough conditions to have the capacity to continue to invest and thus drive those businesses in a meaningful way forward generating organic types of growth. And so I think we believe that with that as a backdrop, you will begin to see some potential conversations and dialogues about strategic pivots by those firms, absent some sort of V shaped recovery, and so again, I think we look at that in the same way we do with the other segment from an M&A standpoint is on our strategic radar. We look at it as a complement to organic growth. If it's aligned strategically, operationally and financially with our business, we would have an interest in having that type of dialogue. So hopefully that gives you some perspective, at least on the M&A landscape. I think if you flip over to the question that you were asking about value propositions relative to the competition. I alluded to the fact that it can be tough, given the macro conditions with a highly leveraged balance sheet and some of the financial drivers of your top line growth challenged in this type of environment. I think for us, we look at our model and just continue to invest in it to enrich the competitive appeal of that model through its capabilities, its services, its technology, we feel good about that baseline value that we offer today. I think when you come through an environment like this with our resiliency, stability and those capabilities and you add to that the continued capacity to invest, we think that creates a pretty appealing scenario and an alternative for advisors to consider. And we'll continue then to take that position of strength and explore those possibilities across the independent space and the new markets that we've talked about in terms of attracting new advisors to our platform. So we think that creates a pretty compelling alternative option and if you don't have those opportunities associated with your model, then it makes us a pretty tough team to beat. Yeah, so it's a great question Alex. Let me take a stab at that. And again you're welcome to ask a follow on if I don't cover all of that. I think the \u2013 with respect to sustaining that type of NNA growth, I think that is certainly our aspiration and one of our primary areas of focus. And I think coming into the quarter, we had a good trajectory on that organic growth. And in Q1, we continued that trend. So that's certainly a nice jumping off point. I think as you look forward, we believe that capacity to invest, the investments we've made over the past three years, give us a real strong positioning from a competitive appeal, as we talked about. And again, our ability to continue to invest we think will continue to extend that differentiation and that competitive advantage. I think, you also then match that with the resiliency of our platform and the ability we've had to serve and support our advisors through what is a challenging and tough environment and you take that baseline, you add that to it, you add the ability to invest in it. And again, that combination creates an interesting opportunity for us as we think about sustaining that organic growth, both across new store sales, but also across same store sales and retention. And so I think we're pretty encouraged when we look at that package of options, alternatives and levers that we can continue to drive that that trajectory and trend with respect to our NNA over time. So short answer is, yeah, we feel pretty good about our continued focus on sustaining that and our competitive advantages, options, alternatives and tools in order to do that. Yeah, you had a second part. I don't think I got you. Yeah, well, I'll speak for us. Look, we obviously make a big investment in recruiting and see it as a nice lever of organic growth. And if you look at over the last year, we've recruited 36 billion in assets and we feel good about the progress that we're making there in that ongoing trajectory. There's a couple of key drivers to that. It's certainly continuing to invest in the model and creating differentiated capabilities that create that competitive appeal that I talked about earlier. We feel good about that continued trend and the opportunity with some of the new capabilities we're delivering to continue to create a distinction there. And I think the second part is the efficacy of our business development team and their ability to continue to take what is a competitive differentiated solution and go effectively take that to the marketplace. And as you said, I think in the midst of March where \u2013 or I guess, the full force of the pandemic hit, it was quite disruptive to the typical and traditional recruiting processes that many of them were done in person.  And I think some of the work that we had done to automate and digitize a lot of the processes in the past were certainly the leverage points. But I think that that team's ability to really pull off and explore what were the options and alternatives and it'd be quite agile about different ways to solve where you couldn't travel or you couldn't have a home office visit or you couldn't go visit an office and bring them on board and help them transition into the platform. Then we created digitized tools to overcome those things so that we could continue our activities. And though, as we said March had an impact in terms of the overall recruiting. We did see some deals get pushed back into second quarter because of some of that complexity. We were able to mitigate some of those challenges with these digitized capabilities, and we'll continue to leverage them going forward. And they accentuate our opportunity set in April as we're seeing in some cases where we use a digitized means to onboard someone, creating a faster ramp up in assets than we've seen traditionally. So there's some cool possibilities there that we'll continue to work on, we'll refine, we still have things to learn. But it's all in the spirit of continuously getting better. Yeah, maybe I'll take a stab at that first. And I'll let Matt give you some additional color. I think if you if you look, interestingly at the trends, you would have seen some stronger new store sales at the beginning of the quarter, that had some impact in March as the pandemic sort of took and created a bigger impact. I think, contrary to that same store sales actually strengthened through the quarter as the value proposition of these advisors providing insight and perspective both when the engagement was good beginning of the quarter, but the sentiment was positive, as well as in March where sentiment had completely changed, but again the engagement was still strong as there was a lot to help clients with in terms of how they think about their financial futures and their life goals and dreams. And so, we actually saw same store sales build throughout the quarter. Do you want to put a higher capstone on that? Yeah, it's a really great question Bill. And it is early. We can look to history as a way to \u2013 as one source of data to think about that question. I think you can also look to human behavior and when you go through an impact like this, what sort of ongoing tail impact does it have on how people think about an allocation or even advisors allocations? My sense of it is this. I do believe you'll see cash in just more normalized market environments i.e. less volatility. You'll see more money get put back to work. Do we return to those 4% cash as a percentage of overall asset levels? I'm not sure, I think that's on the backs of a long sustained bull market and probably have more risk taking appetite than the one normally might. So as you think about the 4% range in assets that we jumped off of, to now it's roughly 7% of total assets. I think historically says you live in a five to six range and that may be a reasonable way to think about this over the long-term, acknowledging that there's lots of data to collect and more time to play out, but that might be a framework, at least of which to enrich your thinking. Yeah. So I'll take the business solutions first Bill and then I'll turn it over to Matt. So look, it's just for everyone, as a reminder, the business solutions is really about providing access to expertise and affordable way to help advisors operate their businesses. And in Q1 we had good momentum to start the quarter. The fundamental value proposition continues to resonate with our advisors. And we saw our subscriber base grow to around 700 in the first quarter, which is up roughly 50 over fourth quarter, so that's all a good solid baseline and we feel good about that. Certainly when COVID arrived, we saw two things that maybe are worth noting. The first is the advisors who were in the pipeline to potentially set up a subscription and begin to use one of those services, that progress slowed as they rightfully shifted their focus over to serving and supporting their clients and not it's prioritizing sort of starting something new. And I think that creates some short-term headwind in terms of working through that. We also cancelled some conferences that we would have typically used as sales forums for business solutions.  So we have to find other ways of which to consistently offer those types of solutions, which we do, but those are just sometimes centre pieces to how we offer those types of solutions in Q1. So that has a bit of a headwind as well. I think more on the favorable side of it, though the advisors that are using these services, given the complexity of the operating environment in the first quarter, the value of these solutions was magnified, whether it was the marketing solutions, not just helping them with lead generation, but helping them manage their client communications in a really intense time where the CFO solutions helping them with business stress testing or cash flow analysis and evaluations, the tech solutions where we actually came up with a really cool creative, turnkey remote office solution within literally two weeks, within the quarter to again, help advisors and working from home and making that simpler and easier. So it really does reinforce the value these solutions offered to the advisors. So, again, we were excited about the long-term opportunity set and the value they create. You just got some short-term headwinds that we've had to work through. Matt, you want to take the second part of it. Thank you, Bill. Now, let me give you a little color on that. Again, Matt, if you want to add anything behind that. So look, if I took at a high level, I think you're in the earlier part of the nine innings game in terms of the adoption and utilization of centrally managed solutions. And I think the continued investment we make in the capabilities, the flexibility, the optionality we give the advisors, the improvement and user interfaces all will help support and drive the continued use of centrally managed platforms. I think we recognized there's more innovation out there for us to work on and add to those centrally managed solutions, such that you've got terrific investment options and strategies that help those advisors create and add value to their clients. You can do it in a highly simplified, digitized way that gives access to the advisor to kind of take their hands on and off the wheel is a really interesting appealing package of value to those advisors. As we continue to evolve our capabilities there, we think there's a correlation between the evolution of those capabilities and the utilization of the centrally managed platforms.  What's driving it? I think advisors more and more recognize and look for that it can be a great leverage point their overall practice and as they try to either lower their costs or create more flexibility to reallocate their time to more valuable activities, I think this becomes a more and more appealing type of concept that they can use as a leverage point to their practices. So we create a really appealing solution. Their need for will only evolve and grow as they look for more leverage points in their practice, that's we think, a nice combination to drive a long sustainable trend, which is why we say it's in the early parts of the game. I don't know if Matt, you want to add anything to that? Yeah, so obviously, pulling together 8,000 to 9,000 people in July doesn't sound like a great risk to take given the backdrop and so we announced that we would shift this to a virtual conference. A lot of folks are working on that same concept. There's again, some interesting technologies and cool ways of which to share that content in a more digital platform. And so we're working through exactly how we would do that, the cost associated with doing that, working with sponsors to be a part of that overall program, so more to come on that. But I think Matt's right, as we think about third quarter and that being our largest conference. As we get through the other side of that and would expect you to see some shift or change in the overall economics around focus on our big conference. Thank you. Yeah. So Ken, I think there's no doubt this will create some structural change across the market and the industry and I think probably history again tells us the magnitude that change will likely be driven by the desire of individual firms and how much they want to embrace and pull that change through. And we entered this environment with \u2013 as I said earlier, where we established some principles that drove how we think about this opportunity. And that starts with taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and also at the same time protecting the health and safety of our employees. So those principles drove our thinking, our decision making through this and actually, given this significant change across both of those spectrums, there's a tremendous amount of learning opportunity that sits inside that change, right, which took us to the next place we went to in managing through this was our culture and our values. And one of our values is a commitment to learning and applying that learning to drive innovation in an agile way.  And so in a climate like this, where we talked about this significant change, we believe it creates an incredible opportunity to learn and apply that learning going forward to drive real structural differences in the business. And I think you hit on in the spirit of brevity one of those examples, which would be how people think about a distributed workforce. And what does that mean as you apply that to 4,500 employees in our case or nearly 17,000 advisors and how we support engage with them or even as you said, how we \u2013 how they would engage in, in millions of their clients. And so we believe there's a real ripe opportunity that this creates an opening of which to think about things in a different way and opens up the playing field, if you will, do experimentation, to do things that you may never have done otherwise. There could be jobs that you didn't think were possible to do remotely from home that all of a sudden by doing it, you now have a different point of view on that and that shapes how you think about managing your workforce, flexible schedules, how you access talent and even how you manage your real estate portfolio.  And that's just one example, right, that sits inside that structural changes suggested. We believe the whole use of robotics, AI and digital tools will be different going forward, people's thinking around outsourcing and supply chains will be changed forever by this if they have a desire to pull that through. And I think we're looking at it those things and more, really challenging ourselves to make sure we lean into the learning opportunities, and how you may pull through those changes to reshape your cost structure, to reshape how you engage with your employees all the way to how you position your advisors to deliver a different client experience to their client. So that's the spectrum of opportunity we kind of see coming out of this. There will be more to emerge. It's early. We've got a lot to learn, but we're trying to be purposeful about getting our arms around as much as that isn't cancer and be thoughtful and having an informed view is the best way forward. Thank you. And hey, thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, stay healthy."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call for LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Jonathan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2021, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dream. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter and year of solid results while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.2 trillion, which was up approximately $300 billion or 34% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth, our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's Wealth Management business and complemented by equity market percentage. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $26 billion, which translated to 9% annualized growth driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. Over the past year, organic net new assets totaled $119 billion or 13% organic growth, up from 7% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion, bringing our full year total to $89 million, which is more than double a year ago. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, with the backdrop of a continued strong investor engagement, our advisers remain focused on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. As a result, advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing plans, a combination that continued to drive solid same-store sales. At the same time, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations model. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the fourth quarter and over the past year. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outlook with $1.63 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $7.02, an increase of 9% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plans. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire adviser centered marketplace, which for us means being the best of empowering advisers to deliver great advice to their client and to be great operators of their business. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to clients. And at the same time, through human-driven, technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary entrepreneurial. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work with 4 strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market. In our traditional markets, fourth quarter recruiting continued to be a significant source of growth with a new high of approximately $15 billion in assets. Ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA custody offering, we recruited approximately $2 billion in assets in fourth quarter. In each of these 3 models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipelines, which position them going forward for increased contributions to organic growth. Large financial institutions were a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&T and will continue to contribute this year with the planned onboarding of CUNA. Our insights and progress over the last 18 months have led to the continued enhancement of our value proposition. And consequently, our demand and pipeline in this market continue to build. Given our experience and more seasoned view from this work, we see large financial institutions as a more accessible market opportunity for us and another new and distinct affiliation model that can drive sustainable organic growth over time. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2022, we will maintain our focus on developing capabilities and solutions in 3 key areas. The first is to enrich the end-client experience with expanded digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business.  Second, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients with differentiated advice, products and pricing. Third, we will continue to advance client work to our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more clients, all of which contributes to enhanced performance of their practice. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention. Let's next move to our third strategic thing, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past 2 years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pure model, including voice, chat and digital support giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. In 2022, we will continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisers. Now this year, we will also advance to the next phase of our transformation, which is the streamlining and automation of our back-office operations. We will leverage Six Sigma process optimization and robotics and machine learning to reengineer our core clearing functions, including new account opening, transfers and money movement. These efforts will increase speed and accuracy for our advisers and their clients. In the future, we plan to extend this transformation from the service and operations organization to trading and compliance. Doing so better positions us to create frictionless, efficient processes throughout our operations that enhance service levels, delight advisers and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisers run the most successful businesses in the independent market. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisers more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. In the fourth quarter, our subscription base continued to grow, more than doubling year-over-year to approximately 3,000 subscribers, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. And while working with advisers on evolving our suite of business solutions, we identified a new category of opportunity that will help advisers more efficiently and effectively deliver comprehensive financial advice and planning solution. And to help solve for this need, we are innovating on services that provide expertise and leverage to do this planning in a scalable way across their entire client base. Our first offering in this area is paraplanning, which is a service that builds financial plans for advisers and then in turn utilize them to establish an investment strategy, help clients achieve their goals and objectives. This service launched last month and is receiving positive early feedback and engagement in the marketplace. We're also incubating other solutions, including tax planning and high network service.  As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio to help advisers run extraordinary businesses and provide differentiated planning and advice for their clients and, in turn, to drive gross profit and organic growth over time. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and, as a result, have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2021. Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. We entered 2021 with momentum as we grew assets organically in both our traditional and new markets and successfully onboarded Waddell & Reed, BMO and M&T, all while continuing to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisers to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisers resulted in the highest level of organic net new assets in our addition. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we've built over the last several years, we again entered the new year with positive momentum. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.2 trillion, up 7% from Q3. The key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $26 billion or a 9% annualized growth rate. For the full year, organic net new assets were $119 billion, which translates to a 13% annualized growth rate, up from 7% a year ago. This was driven by strength across all 3 channels of growth: recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q4, recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $89 billion. Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $24 billion or at 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 53% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards adviser. Now let's turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.63, which brought our full year total to $7.02, up 9% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $643 million, up $12 million or 2% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $200 million, down $2 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production volumes. In Q4, our payout ratio was 87.6%, up about 45 basis points from Q3, primarily due to the seasonal build in the production bonus. Looking ahead to Q1, a reminder that the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year, so we anticipate our payout ratio will decline to approximately 86.5%. Moving on to asset-based revenue. Sponsor revenue was $220 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and market appreciation as well as synergies related to Waddell & Reed assets being on our platform. Turning to client cash revenue. It was $82 million, down $9 million from Q3. As anticipated, this was primarily driven by a fixed rate contract maturity at the end of the third quarter. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $57 billion, up $7 billion from last quarter.  Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q4, unchanged from Q3. Within our fixed rate portfolio, in Q4, we added a new $500 million 3-year fixed contract. Looking ahead to Q1, we have a fixed rate maturity of $1 billion. I would like to highlight that we were able to renew that contract at maturity, into a new 4-year fixed rate contract. So given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to decline by a few basis points. Next, I want to highlight an update we made to our income statement this quarter to provide additional insight into our financials. We separated transaction of fees into 2 lines: service and fee and transactions. We hope this additional transparency allows you to more clearly see the revenue generated from predominantly recurring adviser- and investor-based services, apart from our transaction revenues. We have provided a summary of these changes on Page 12 of our Key Metric presentation. So looking at service and fee revenue. In Q4, it was $110 million, up $5 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in Business Solutions revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at Business Solutions, we ended the quarter with over 3,000 subscriptions; which is up approximately 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These services now generate roughly $28 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q1, based on typical seasonality and the growth of Business Solutions, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially. Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $39 million, up $4 million sequentially due to higher trading. As we look ahead to Q1, we have seen an increase in trading activity in January. That said, I would note there are 2 fewer trading days in the quarter, so that would likely offset that increase. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q4. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $299 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.58 billion. As expected, this was near the upper end of our outlook range driven by the variable expenses associated with our strong organic growth. Looking at the full year for 2021 and prior to the impact of Waddell & Reed, we grew core G&A by approximately 8%. Turning to our outlook for 2022. Our long-term strategy is unchanged. We plan to continue to invest to drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage. Over the last few years, we have increased our investments to drive organic growth. Those investments are yielding positive results, including the highest levels of organic growth in our history. And so as we look ahead to 2022, we plan to continue with the same approach. More specifically, we plan to increase our core G&A in the range of 7% to 9.5%, which is a similar growth rate to 2021. I would note that these investments will be focused in 2 primary areas: first, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities as well as a full year of Waddell & Reed expenses; and second, to support growth in our expanded addressable markets and to scale our new services. Also, to give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $280 million to $285 million. We will, of course, remain dynamic to adjust for the pace of our growth and changes in the macro environment. But based on what we see today, we are excited about our opportunities to invest. Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $86 million, up $2 million sequentially, primarily driven by costs to support our organic growth, specifically, transition assistance and large financial institutions. Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase to the low $90 million range, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend as we have 2 of our largest conferences of the year in Q1. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The integration work is going well and remains on track to be completed by the middle of this year. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $70 million in Q4. Based on current asset levels and our continued progress on the integration, we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $90 million by the middle of 2022, up from our prior estimate of $85 million. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $10 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. As we look ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stockholders. So we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $41 million in Q4, up $2 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. This is primarily driven by the deployment of technology to support the integration of Waddell & Reed as well as core technology spend to enhance our industry-leading platform. Given the nonrecurring nature of the integration spend, beyond Q1, we expect a more gradual rise in depreciation and amortization for the remainder of 2022. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4, the leverage ratio at 2.26x and corporate cash of $237 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.  In Q4, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q1 while remaining flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital evolve. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nAlexBlostein: So maybe we'll start with organic growth. Not surprisingly, super strong end to the year. Obviously, wrapping up a good year for you guys from a net new asset and recruiting perspective. Given the sort of changing macro backdrop with both more equity market volatility and obviously down equity markets year-to-date but rising rate dynamics, curious how you think that will impact recruiting and sort of the broader competitive landscape. So are we likely to see FAs being sort of more reluctant to move given the kind of sharp move down in the asset values? Are there likely to be more competition because, again, people are more profitable so that maybe you can afford to pay a little more? So hoping you can sort of flesh out how that plays into your organic growth outlook into next year.\nDan Arnold: Alex, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. So look, I think we always look at sort of the structural opportunities, first and foremost, relative to organic growth. And as we stated in our remarks, right, you've got new store sales, you've got same-store sales, and then certainly retention. And as it relates to new store sales, again, I think the flexibility and optionality around our model, continued investment in differentiation and the capability side of our platform and then using our rate-driven sort of underwriting process, we think that is really a feel in combination that continues to create that sort of structural differentiation out in the marketplace as we move forward. And I think that drives the primary sort of activity and results at the end of the day. Now to your point, certainly, you have to overlay some market conditions that may influence that overall trajectory in the short run. There are cases to where you could have a significant market displacement that could occur that could temporarily disrupt the overall trend of opportunity out in the marketplace, i.e., advisers aren't moving as much because they're focused on those market conditions in serving and supporting their clients, and we've certainly seen that historically in the past. Up to this point, the volatility that we're seeing in the early part of the year, I think, is more aligned with sort of what we've played in the last couple of years. And so we're not seeing, thus far, some outsized impact for disruption in the overall movement out in the marketplace. I do think there's an overall, as we noted in our remarks, a bit slower movement in certain parts of the industry. But again, don't see necessarily thus far the macro influencing that. That's always subject to change if something more dramatic should shift as we move forward. And I think with respect to interest rates, you're suggesting is if there's greater economics built into recruiting, how does that influence transition assistance and/or financial incentives. And again, we've seen no reflection of changing in the underwriting across the marketplace. And we continue to use a return-based approach to that concept. And we factor in, certainly, I think, the characteristics of our overall economics factored in with the macro. And so again, we haven't seen any shift at this point in the overall pricing out in the marketplace for cost of acquisition. I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nMattAudette: No. Fair enough. All set.\nAlex Blostein: Great. A follow-up for Matt, maybe why don't we start with Waddell. Great to see the guide increase to $90 million plus from previous. Can you maybe expand a little bit what the plus depends on, again, is that market related to asset levels and rates? Or are you seeing potential for sort of incremental synergies, whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side? So just maybe a little more color on what could drive the upside there.\nMatt Audette: Yes, definitely. I think as we move towards completing the integration by the middle of this year, the work that's really left is really on the expense synergy side. So as we complete that work, I think the plus is if we end up getting more synergies than expected. So it's kind of a small part of the work is left, and I think that's where the upside would be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup.\nBill Katz: All the added color and disclosure is super helpful. So Dan, maybe a question for you. It sort of seems like from your commentary that the momentum is accelerating across the pipeline. So one clarification. Was that also in that the largest size of the financial institution group that the sort of the group you've historically not been able to go after, that $300 billion? But more broadly, can you just talk about what's resonating in the marketplace as, obviously, your organic growth is accelerating?\nDan Arnold: Thanks, Bill. So yes. Look, organic growth is a key part of our strategy, as we've talked about, and we've stayed very intentional and focused on how do we deliver those results. And I think if you think about our growth going forward, perhaps if you look at the last couple of years as a framework for that, you've got 7% growth in 2020 and 13% growth in 2021, and those are probably pretty nice bookends as a way to think about a range of potential growth over the long run or as we go forward. Obviously, as we talked about in the last question, macro conditions at any point in time, that influence that overall opportunity set. And I think, Bill, what we do to drive that, to get specifically to the second part of your question is we continue to look at investing in our traditional markets, growing the appeal of those markets, so it drives continued new store sales growth and continues to keep retention in that 2% range that we've talked about before. And we believe that investing in continued capabilities that help those advisers differentiate and win out in the marketplace is key to that. So think about that as focus #1. I think second is expanding and accelerating the growth in our new markets. And you said it, we see continued momentum building there. Some of that was a go-to-market. We're new to the marketplace. We continue to iterate and refine those models to make sure they're well positioned and appealing as they can be and create the value that they should for those different segments of the marketplace, and we're seeing that versatility and that flexibility ultimately open up new opportunities. And frankly, it's even helping advisers in our existing platform who have one model, and potentially were thinking about transition to another, staying on our platform because we have that flexibility now. And so we do see continued momentum there, and we've gotten off to a good start here in Q1 relative to the strategic wealth solution as an example. So continued growing contribution from those new markets. And financial institutions, what I was referring to as large financial institutions, this being somewhat of a new market for us. It wasn't a place that we always looked at for opportunity. I don't think we had demonstrated being able to bring a new solution to the marketplace that resonated, and it was actually a different contexted sort of solution for that segment of the marketplace. And I think through a couple of the wins that we've had, it's helped us learn, understand, refine and ultimately see that segment of the marketplace as a more sustainable avenue for growth and for contribution to come. So that's the way to think about the large financial institution markets, if that's helpful. And then finally, the last one is helping our existing advisers grow. And they've certainly done a great job of that over the last couple of years in tough markets, and we continue to see opportunity to invest to help them differentiate their advice, expand their advice, solve new problems for clients and generate net new assets from that. So those are the primary sort of drivers underneath that growth. And I think if you try to apply all of that to 2022, as we think about this year, knowing that a large financial institution is onboarding in CUNA in the first half of the year, we believe we're in the upper half range of that 7% to 13%. So hopefully, that gives you some helpful color.\nBill Katz: That does. And just a follow-up for Matt or maybe, Dan. So just devil's advocate for a moment. If your rate guidance is correct, and if we get rates, hopefully, we will and get a 4, 5 rate hikes this year, all being equal, your guidance would suggest about $2.50 a share of incremental earnings power just based on Page 16 of the supplement. So if you assume that your recruitment remains solid, that your organic growth is bookend here, how do you think about deploying that incremental cash? And maybe you could speak to the M&A pipeline versus buyback at the margins for your choices.\nMatt Audette: Yes. Sure, Bill. I'll take that one. I think when you look at our plans for the year, and I think you see those well in the core G&A specifically in the 7% to 9.5% range, I think the primary driver where that's going to land, I think, really is the level of organic growth. I think Dan just gave you some nice range of outcomes and opportunity set that we see there. But really, interest rates, we don't see that driving that this year. I think when you look early in a rate cycle, that those increases and those benefits would typically fall to the bottom line and improve margin. So as we look beyond that and apply those excess funds to your question to our capital allocation framework, I think that the approach that we've taken in the past is really the same framework that we have today. And I think that will guide us. And it's back, first and foremost, to looking at opportunities to drive more organic growth, right? It could be things like new capabilities for advisers, things like further enhancing the service experience, expanding services to help advisers run their business as a few examples. I think to your question on the M&A front, I think there's 2, call it, categories of opportunities there. That's a place where you can accelerate the delivery of capabilities through M&A. We've done a few small acquisitions there. And then the more, call it, standard or classic growth acquisitions as long as the returns are compelling, which obviously is key. And then lastly, returning capital to shareholders, which we also see as a compelling way to deploy capital. So I think we're going to remain flexible and adjust if needed. And to your point, as we go through this year and with expected rate increases occurring, I think we'll apply those funds at that time to our framework and see what makes more sense at that time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So wanted to start with a question on rate optionality. Matt, since your rate sensitivity disclosure, the $310 million increase in gross profit from 4 hikes, it is based on a static balance sheet. And I was hoping to unpack some of the sources of rate upside that maybe aren't captured in that figure. And in particular, with money market balances running at very elevated levels, I was wondering how we should be thinking about both the capacity and timing to move money fund balances back into ICA as the Fed begins hiking. And with signs of bank demands also coming back for both floating and fixed rate agreements, a bit sooner than we were expecting, how should we be thinking about the glide path to getting back to that fixed target range of 50% to 75%?\nMatt Audette: Yes. So great question, Steven. I think when you look at the money market, the balances in the money market overflow, and I think we put it in font size that folks at my age are just even hard to see, but I think you see a footnote there. If those balances go back into ICA, that would be an additional $30 million upside for rate hike for those overall balances. So it just gives you a sense as if demand does come back to the market and those [overall] allowances move gives you a sense of the benefit. I think where that market stands, and I think you started to hint at it well in your question, I think where we sit today, the market and the -- therefore, the ability to do that hasn't really changed much. I'd say, if anything, it's improved a little. I think when you look at the things that would drive that, we're starting to see some positive signs, right? Consumer spending continuing to increase. Loan balances starting to grow off their lows at the big lenders. And then the biggest factor of all, the Fed, right, not only talking about raising interest rates and tapering, but actually talking about shrinking the balance sheet, their balance sheet. And those are the things that if all that occurs, I think, really removes a lot of liquidity from the system, and then we're naturally in a place to be a provider of them. So it feels like the winds are blowing in the right direction, but things haven't really moved much yet. I would highlight some things we were able to do in the quarter. Like on the floating rate side, we are seeing pricing in the Fed funds plus 5 zone, where I think you were flat to negative when you think about more last year. And then on the fixed rate side, we're able to add a new contract this quarter, the $0.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared remarks. And the maturity that's upcoming in Q1, we're able to renew that into a new 4-year contract at 140 basis points, right? We haven't had that rate, I think, since pre-COVID or pre-pandemic. So the market, I think, remains challenging. But I think there's a lot of good signs that if those things play out, it would improve. And I think pulling that through to the last part of your question is how does that fit into us getting to the 50% to 75% target range of the fixed rate portfolio, I think I'd just emphasize that remains our target. We're sitting at 25% now. I think in periods of low interest rates like we're in now, if demand is there, we'd probably want to stay shorter and closer to that 50%. And if rates are much higher with a steep curve, we want to be closer to 75%. And I think right now, the limiting factor there is more just the demand itself, which -- as I just commented on, which is why we're on 5. So hopefully, that helps, and I think I got -- I think it was a 3-parter, Steven. I think I got them all.\nSteven Chubak: It was actually a 2-parter, Matt. But I'm still going to push with a related follow-up, but it will be related, rest assured, just on cash balance growth expectations. You're entering the coming cycle with cash as a percentage of assets, relatively close to the 4% floor that you had spoken to previously, and that's before the Fed has even started tightening or where we would typically expect to see some signs of cash sorting as you noted in response to my earlier question or multipart questions. So given the strong organic growth that you're generating and just the need for advisers to maintain some minimum level of liquidity, should we still view that 4% as a reasonable floor on cash, which, all else being equal, would imply sustained growth in cash balances, at least in the mid- to high single-digit range even as the Fed begins to tighten this year?\nMatt Audette: Yes, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I think when we look at the dynamics of this cash, right, which is operational cash, right, for rebalancing or a weighting investment, I don't think we've seen anything change in how advisers give advice, the dynamics of that rebalancing and trading that would cause us to have a different view. So I think 4% is a good way to think about a floor. Now that doesn't mean 3.9 is a problem and a possibility. But I think when you think about it as a range, I think 4% is still the good percent to think of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to follow up a little bit there just on those overflow balances. I guess the point on the last question, just in a rising rate environment, I guess, what are the prospects, do you think, for those overflow ICA and overflow money fund balances to come back into an ICA floating? What really needs to happen? And how do rising rates impact the likelihood, the possibility and the timing for that to play out?\nMatt Audette: Yes, sure. So Michael, it was what we were just talking about. I think that the mechanics are demand really returning to the market. And I think -- so then you click down and say what are the things that would cause that demand to return, and it's things that remove the excess cash off the banks that we will be placing that suite to, right? So that's consumer spending going up. That's loan balances on those balance sheets going up. And then the big factor, when you look at the Fed and the cash that's injected into the system, ultimately, it makes its way onto the balance sheet to those large financial institutions that we place our suite with. So it's really all connected. It's as simple as that. As demand returns, the mechanics of an overflow or when there's capacity in ICA, it goes back.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And then just a follow-up question on the expense front. You guys had flagged a more elevated promotional expense in the first quarter here just given some of the seasonality, but I was hoping you might be able to unpack what pieces of that come out as we go into the latter half of this year. How you see that trending, whether it's T&E, additional conferences? How do you see that trending?\nMatt Audette: Yes, sure. And maybe just to hit again the Q1 numbers. When you look at the Q1 promotional expense, the key thing that I would highlight is it's really a function of our conference schedule. And when you look at 2021, if you recall, we had our conferences entirely in the second half of the year given the COVID environment. And this year, it's going to be a more typical schedule with conference expense showing up primarily in Q1 and Q3. So that's probably the main, maybe, thing you can intuitively see, right? The remaining drivers are all just connected to growth, the typical TA and the related amortization that comes from that as well as the cost to support the large financial institutions that we've talked a bit about here, M&T and BMO and then as we begin to support CUNA. So as we get deeper into the year, and maybe just to think about the full year, right, just giving you the context on Q1, when we think about the full year, it's really similar drivers, right? The biggest driver is typically organic growth, the pace of that and the TA and associated amortization that shows up when that recruiting happens. As Dan highlighted earlier, the rates haven't really changed for that. Those have been quite stable. So I think the key driver there is going to be really the level of recruiting that we have. On the conference front for the year, we're really planning to return to in-person events, right, so that would likely bring our conference spend for the year back to pre-COVID levels. I'd estimate that around a $20 million increase for the full year '22 versus full year '21. And then lastly, the onboarding expenses associated with CUNA, right? Similar to M&T and BMO in '21, we'll have those expenses in '22 for CUNA. So those are really the 3 biggest drivers I'd highlight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe first, just a follow-up question on the cash balances, just with the meaningful cash build in December that you saw. Just wondering if you could share any information on whether those cash balances have been sticky thus far in January or you're seeing those kind of flow back into the market.\nMatt Audette: Yes. We would typically see that happen, right? You get a normal build in the fourth quarter of each year, and you start to see those balances go back into the market in the first few months of the year. But with all the volatility we've seen this year and in this January, we've actually seen the cash balances continue to build. So they're up about another $1 billion for the month of January. I would emphasize, though, I think when volatility falls and things get back to normal, whatever your definition of normal is, I think we would expect to see that cash start to go back into the market. It's a lot of tax positioning, tax planning that you'd see in December, a lot of dividends and interest that come in. So it is very natural for that to get deployed back into the market in the coming months.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is just on the D&A guidance. I think you gave some commentary on the first quarter being up $5 million and a gradual increase from there. I think that implies something likely over a 20% increase versus 2021. I'm just trying to get a sense of if you look out over the medium term, and maybe it's a question more for the CapEx side of the business, are you comfortable, I guess, with the level of spend on the CapEx side? And if you could just go into a little bit more detail on the drivers of the increases here, that would be helpful.\nMatt Audette: Yes. Yes, definitely. I think when you look at our core technology portfolio investments there, which is driving that increase, we've been increasing that around 8% per year for a while, and we plan to do the same in 2022. I think what you're seeing, the big pickup is really the technology associated with integrating and onboarding Waddell & Reed, and we had a big deployment in that area in the fourth quarter that then is going to lead to that depreciation increasing in Q1. So I think the increase that may not make intuitive sense is really connected with the acquisition. We factor those costs into the overall multiple, which you can see in the materials we estimated 4.5x. So it's really the core portfolio growing at 8%, I think as -- think about that as the ongoing runway.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Just one for me this evening. Clearly, some strong momentum as it relates to the Business Solutions side. And apologies if I missed it, but what -- can you give us a little context about what's really resonating as it relates to the 400 incremental new subscriptions or perhaps what you see kind of onto come into 2022? And then also, can you help us maybe tie together just what the investment and spend looks like as it relates to the growth of these business solutions if that's part of that kind of core G&A number or if it shows up elsewhere? Any sort of kind of color or context, I think, would be helpful.\nDan Arnold: How about I take part A. Matt, take part B. So thanks for the question. And look, with respect to Business Solutions, just as a bit of a context, if you\u2019ll remember, that was an opportunity originally around this hypothesis of how do we help advisers, not only be great advisers, but to help them run private businesses. And we knew there was a significant amount of local level of spend that advisers are trying to help anything, accounting or bookkeeping to some sort of cash flow analysis to marketing support, tech support, all the things that you would think about in running a more entrepreneurial, smaller, midsized business. And so that was our original hypothesis.  And so as we've gotten in and continue to learn and serve and support them through our CFO solution, our marketing solution and our admin solution, I think those fundamentally and structurally resonate them and the needs that they have associated with those types of roles resonated. And what we've learned along the way, though, was there's also discrete problems that we can solve that don't require a full CFO. And we've been able to come up with sort of second-generation products, if you will, across the CFO and marketing landscape that expand our product offering, give different price points that make those services more and more accessible to more and more advisers. And so we will continue to innovate around what I would call the Business Services and think there's a significant room for opportunity when you look out overall -- advisers. And so those, again, I think, are really interesting, not only in the fundamental for initial offering, but multiple generations from their products in place. And I think at the same time, as we've been innovating and working on those types of solutions, we learn more and more about new ways of new things that advisers are trying to solve for, and that's where we came up with help with succession planning around assurance plan. So our M&A solutions where that was borne out of how we think about succession planning and selling my business or an adviser is going to grow through buying a business. And we realized that those were obstacles and [obstacles] typically don't do, and we could come in with some expertise and leverage and help them execute around that to make those possible. So solving specifically again in and around how do I grow in to think about succession planning have been valuable areas of innovation to help drive that subscription base. I think as we go forward, what we've also unlocked is a new category of opportunity where we will focus on helping them be great business owners. Now we've unlocked this opportunity where they may share, \u201chey, look, I want to provide a broader base of financial planning across my entire client base. I need some leverage to do that as that's time-consuming and hard to do.\u201d So hence, this concept of consulting them [indiscernible] do the plans for them to position them than to go build the financial strategy and investment strategy associated with that. And so this has unlocked this full new category of helping them expand and broaden for the comprehensive advice, which just makes them more appealing and differentiated from other options out in the marketplace and hence help us to further this. So that's opportunity set as we move forward with respect to business and solutions. And to some degree, some of the initial products that have helped us get where we are, I hope that helps.\nMatt Audette: Gerry, on the second part of your question on the cost front, I mean, the headline is that the costs that are included in our core G&A, included in core G&A guidance for 2022. So 7% to 9.5% range would include the cost of scale, our new services and specifically Business Solutions, as Dan just described.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. And actually, I just had one sort of, I guess, small follow-up, perhaps somewhat of a small point. But the interest rate sensitivity page, if I kind of compare this quarter-over-quarter, it looks like cash balances went up, but the incremental benefit from the next 4 rate hikes went down, granted it's a modest amount. And perhaps, you've already touched on it with some of the prior questions, so I apologize. But can you just maybe flesh that out a little? I would have maybe expected it to go in the other way.\nMatt Audette: Yes, yes. I mean, I think it changed a little bit. I think the key is you saw the growth in those overflow balances in money markets and actually a slight decline in ICA. So while the sensitivities that are front and center in those bar charts went down a little bit, if you look at that footnote or the benefit associated with if and when those money market overflows go back into ICA, that actually went up, right? So it kind of shows up in a couple of different places, but it's just a mix, and we calculate those based on where we are at the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: SWS wins have really been impressive. You got over 20 on the Board at this point. So far, what's been the feedback as you've built this offering out from advisers that you've onboarded? And are there any ways in which, based on that feedback, you're tweaking the offering or making adjustments in order to make it even more compelling?\nDan Arnold: Thanks for the question. And yes, we are encouraged by the offering in the marketplace. And I think we probably -- when we first went to market with this solution, I think we've done some good research and insights, and all solid offering. But as people get in and begin to use that solution, you obviously begin to learn opportunities of probably creating some additional digital workflows that help them with efficiency inside the practices, which have being good feedback and learnings for us.  Continuing to more fully integrate some of our banking solutions was a another feedback that we've gotten that we've been working on to do that we think makes the solution more appealing. I think some of our high net worth solutions that we're working on have also been -- they've been a good source of feedback there to help us refine the development in those. So those are maybe some categories to think about where we've both made some improvements and continue to work to enhance the model. But I think foundation, if you think about 85%, 90% of the core solution and the feedback we're getting in the NPS scores that we're getting from this group, it would reflect a good, solid offering, delivering on what they had hoped, which is to help to transition to an independent practice and the ongoing support, operate a successful and independent business. So we feel good about where we are and continue to take that feedback and apply it to enhanced offering.\nBrennan Hawken: All right. That makes sense. And then just one follow-up, Matt, on the promotional expense. And you spoke to the -- to this -- to some degree, so it might be embedded within the prior answer. But when we look at the pickup in promotional from 4Q into the low 90s that you expect next quarter, it's my understanding that we had a conference -- you guys had a conference in the fourth quarter, so I would think that would be a like-for-like. So is the delta quarter-over-quarter really just purely the other factors, the TA and maybe a bit of a step-up in the CUNA onboarding? Or is it part of that embedded $20 million increase in the in-person conferences becoming larger and maybe the fourth quarter was a little smaller? Just understanding some of the complexion there would be helpful.\nMatt Audette: Yes, definitely. And it's where you just ended the question. So it's a combination of -- we've got 2 large -- 2 of our largest conferences in Q1. You're correct, there is large conferences in Q4 as well, but you now have more of an in-person expectations. You have overall a little bit of increase in conferences and then all the growth items that you described. So it's a little bit of both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Young from Truist Securities.\nMichael Young: I wanted to follow up on the Business Solutions portion of the business again. And good to see you get up to 3,000 subscriptions, another year of kind of doubling that. Is there any reason why we shouldn't expect that to continue to double or even more than double? I mean are we accelerating there? Or just any thoughts along the kind of pace of growth, especially with the new product additions would be helpful.\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think you should think about that as the ongoing similar momentum that you've seen over the last year. With a bigger base requires obviously more incremental growth to create a doubling effect, if you will. But I do think that we've become better at offering these products. We've refined the existing version of products. And the new products coming out, that certainly will contribute to subscription growth. And again, we continue to try to refine our approach. And if we see opportunity or we've got gaps to fill in, then we certainly pivot and make those investments along the way. But I think the consistent sort of trajectory that we're on now feels like the best way to describe how we think about it over the next year.\nMichael Young: Okay. And as a follow-up, sorry, I apologize for switching gears here. But just on the financial institution side of the business, BMO, M&T last year, you got CUNA this year. Just from a capacity standpoint, I mean, would you all be able to announce additional partnerships this year? And how soon would you be prepared to actually execute following CUNA? And given kind of the splashes that you've made in that market recently with the size of the deals, are you having more conversations today than maybe a year ago regarding partnerships there?\nDan Arnold: So if we go in reverse order, we are having more dialogue around the possibilities of serving or supporting larger financial institutions, also a larger set of institutions in different sort of categories. So that creates more dialogue and more opportunities. With respect to the planning around these, I think we've got to be thoughtful and diligent around not just thinking about winning those deals, but making sure that we execute well behind them. And you've got to be thoughtful about your funnel and the pacing of that. These are also longer sales cycles because they're more complex than our typical other business development efforts and activity. And so without giving you a perfect time line, I think we have to be thoughtful and factor in our ability to execute match with that demand and opportunity and then plan those out so that we execute them well.  It's also worked on the other side with these institutions to work through and think through doing that. And so they also have their own execution limitations, if you will, that we've got to collaborate and partner up with them. And so without giving you some specific time frame around when some next deal may come, I think we have active dialogue going on with a broader set of prospects and then we'll factor in their ability to execute, our ability to execute and time those in a way that makes sense for doing that well.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks.\nDan Arnold: Yes. I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next time. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2021. Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. We entered 2021 with momentum as we grew assets organically in both our traditional and new markets and successfully onboarded Waddell & Reed, BMO and M&T, all while continuing to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisers to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisers resulted in the highest level of organic net new assets in our addition. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we've built over the last several years, we again entered the new year with positive momentum. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.2 trillion, up 7% from Q3. The key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $26 billion or a 9% annualized growth rate. For the full year, organic net new assets were $119 billion, which translates to a 13% annualized growth rate, up from 7% a year ago. This was driven by strength across all 3 channels of growth: recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q4, recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $89 billion. Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $24 billion or at 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 53% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards adviser. Now let's turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.63, which brought our full year total to $7.02, up 9% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $643 million, up $12 million or 2% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $200 million, down $2 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production volumes. In Q4, our payout ratio was 87.6%, up about 45 basis points from Q3, primarily due to the seasonal build in the production bonus. Looking ahead to Q1, a reminder that the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year, so we anticipate our payout ratio will decline to approximately 86.5%. Moving on to asset-based revenue. Sponsor revenue was $220 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and market appreciation as well as synergies related to Waddell & Reed assets being on our platform. Turning to client cash revenue. It was $82 million, down $9 million from Q3. As anticipated, this was primarily driven by a fixed rate contract maturity at the end of the third quarter. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $57 billion, up $7 billion from last quarter.  Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q4, unchanged from Q3. Within our fixed rate portfolio, in Q4, we added a new $500 million 3-year fixed contract. Looking ahead to Q1, we have a fixed rate maturity of $1 billion. I would like to highlight that we were able to renew that contract at maturity, into a new 4-year fixed rate contract. So given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to decline by a few basis points. Next, I want to highlight an update we made to our income statement this quarter to provide additional insight into our financials. We separated transaction of fees into 2 lines: service and fee and transactions. We hope this additional transparency allows you to more clearly see the revenue generated from predominantly recurring adviser- and investor-based services, apart from our transaction revenues. We have provided a summary of these changes on Page 12 of our Key Metric presentation. So looking at service and fee revenue. In Q4, it was $110 million, up $5 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in Business Solutions revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at Business Solutions, we ended the quarter with over 3,000 subscriptions; which is up approximately 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These services now generate roughly $28 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q1, based on typical seasonality and the growth of Business Solutions, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially. Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $39 million, up $4 million sequentially due to higher trading. As we look ahead to Q1, we have seen an increase in trading activity in January. That said, I would note there are 2 fewer trading days in the quarter, so that would likely offset that increase. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q4. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $299 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.58 billion. As expected, this was near the upper end of our outlook range driven by the variable expenses associated with our strong organic growth. Looking at the full year for 2021 and prior to the impact of Waddell & Reed, we grew core G&A by approximately 8%. Turning to our outlook for 2022. Our long-term strategy is unchanged. We plan to continue to invest to drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage. Over the last few years, we have increased our investments to drive organic growth. Those investments are yielding positive results, including the highest levels of organic growth in our history. And so as we look ahead to 2022, we plan to continue with the same approach. More specifically, we plan to increase our core G&A in the range of 7% to 9.5%, which is a similar growth rate to 2021. I would note that these investments will be focused in 2 primary areas: first, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities as well as a full year of Waddell & Reed expenses; and second, to support growth in our expanded addressable markets and to scale our new services. Also, to give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $280 million to $285 million. We will, of course, remain dynamic to adjust for the pace of our growth and changes in the macro environment. But based on what we see today, we are excited about our opportunities to invest. Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $86 million, up $2 million sequentially, primarily driven by costs to support our organic growth, specifically, transition assistance and large financial institutions. Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase to the low $90 million range, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend as we have 2 of our largest conferences of the year in Q1. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The integration work is going well and remains on track to be completed by the middle of this year. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $70 million in Q4. Based on current asset levels and our continued progress on the integration, we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $90 million by the middle of 2022, up from our prior estimate of $85 million. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $10 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. As we look ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stockholders. So we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $41 million in Q4, up $2 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. This is primarily driven by the deployment of technology to support the integration of Waddell & Reed as well as core technology spend to enhance our industry-leading platform. Given the nonrecurring nature of the integration spend, beyond Q1, we expect a more gradual rise in depreciation and amortization for the remainder of 2022. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4, the leverage ratio at 2.26x and corporate cash of $237 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.  In Q4, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q1 while remaining flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital evolve. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. No. Fair enough. All set. Yes, definitely. I think as we move towards completing the integration by the middle of this year, the work that's really left is really on the expense synergy side. So as we complete that work, I think the plus is if we end up getting more synergies than expected. So it's kind of a small part of the work is left, and I think that's where the upside would be. Yes. Sure, Bill. I'll take that one. I think when you look at our plans for the year, and I think you see those well in the core G&A specifically in the 7% to 9.5% range, I think the primary driver where that's going to land, I think, really is the level of organic growth. I think Dan just gave you some nice range of outcomes and opportunity set that we see there. But really, interest rates, we don't see that driving that this year. I think when you look early in a rate cycle, that those increases and those benefits would typically fall to the bottom line and improve margin. So as we look beyond that and apply those excess funds to your question to our capital allocation framework, I think that the approach that we've taken in the past is really the same framework that we have today. And I think that will guide us. And it's back, first and foremost, to looking at opportunities to drive more organic growth, right? It could be things like new capabilities for advisers, things like further enhancing the service experience, expanding services to help advisers run their business as a few examples. I think to your question on the M&A front, I think there's 2, call it, categories of opportunities there. That's a place where you can accelerate the delivery of capabilities through M&A. We've done a few small acquisitions there. And then the more, call it, standard or classic growth acquisitions as long as the returns are compelling, which obviously is key. And then lastly, returning capital to shareholders, which we also see as a compelling way to deploy capital. So I think we're going to remain flexible and adjust if needed. And to your point, as we go through this year and with expected rate increases occurring, I think we'll apply those funds at that time to our framework and see what makes more sense at that time. Yes. So great question, Steven. I think when you look at the money market, the balances in the money market overflow, and I think we put it in font size that folks at my age are just even hard to see, but I think you see a footnote there. If those balances go back into ICA, that would be an additional $30 million upside for rate hike for those overall balances. So it just gives you a sense as if demand does come back to the market and those [overall] allowances move gives you a sense of the benefit. I think where that market stands, and I think you started to hint at it well in your question, I think where we sit today, the market and the -- therefore, the ability to do that hasn't really changed much. I'd say, if anything, it's improved a little. I think when you look at the things that would drive that, we're starting to see some positive signs, right? Consumer spending continuing to increase. Loan balances starting to grow off their lows at the big lenders. And then the biggest factor of all, the Fed, right, not only talking about raising interest rates and tapering, but actually talking about shrinking the balance sheet, their balance sheet. And those are the things that if all that occurs, I think, really removes a lot of liquidity from the system, and then we're naturally in a place to be a provider of them. So it feels like the winds are blowing in the right direction, but things haven't really moved much yet. I would highlight some things we were able to do in the quarter. Like on the floating rate side, we are seeing pricing in the Fed funds plus 5 zone, where I think you were flat to negative when you think about more last year. And then on the fixed rate side, we're able to add a new contract this quarter, the $0.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared remarks. And the maturity that's upcoming in Q1, we're able to renew that into a new 4-year contract at 140 basis points, right? We haven't had that rate, I think, since pre-COVID or pre-pandemic. So the market, I think, remains challenging. But I think there's a lot of good signs that if those things play out, it would improve. And I think pulling that through to the last part of your question is how does that fit into us getting to the 50% to 75% target range of the fixed rate portfolio, I think I'd just emphasize that remains our target. We're sitting at 25% now. I think in periods of low interest rates like we're in now, if demand is there, we'd probably want to stay shorter and closer to that 50%. And if rates are much higher with a steep curve, we want to be closer to 75%. And I think right now, the limiting factor there is more just the demand itself, which -- as I just commented on, which is why we're on 5. So hopefully, that helps, and I think I got -- I think it was a 3-parter, Steven. I think I got them all. Yes, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I think when we look at the dynamics of this cash, right, which is operational cash, right, for rebalancing or a weighting investment, I don't think we've seen anything change in how advisers give advice, the dynamics of that rebalancing and trading that would cause us to have a different view. So I think 4% is a good way to think about a floor. Now that doesn't mean 3.9 is a problem and a possibility. But I think when you think about it as a range, I think 4% is still the good percent to think of. Yes, sure. So Michael, it was what we were just talking about. I think that the mechanics are demand really returning to the market. And I think -- so then you click down and say what are the things that would cause that demand to return, and it's things that remove the excess cash off the banks that we will be placing that suite to, right? So that's consumer spending going up. That's loan balances on those balance sheets going up. And then the big factor, when you look at the Fed and the cash that's injected into the system, ultimately, it makes its way onto the balance sheet to those large financial institutions that we place our suite with. So it's really all connected. It's as simple as that. As demand returns, the mechanics of an overflow or when there's capacity in ICA, it goes back. Yes, sure. And maybe just to hit again the Q1 numbers. When you look at the Q1 promotional expense, the key thing that I would highlight is it's really a function of our conference schedule. And when you look at 2021, if you recall, we had our conferences entirely in the second half of the year given the COVID environment. And this year, it's going to be a more typical schedule with conference expense showing up primarily in Q1 and Q3. So that's probably the main, maybe, thing you can intuitively see, right? The remaining drivers are all just connected to growth, the typical TA and the related amortization that comes from that as well as the cost to support the large financial institutions that we've talked a bit about here, M&T and BMO and then as we begin to support CUNA. So as we get deeper into the year, and maybe just to think about the full year, right, just giving you the context on Q1, when we think about the full year, it's really similar drivers, right? The biggest driver is typically organic growth, the pace of that and the TA and associated amortization that shows up when that recruiting happens. As Dan highlighted earlier, the rates haven't really changed for that. Those have been quite stable. So I think the key driver there is going to be really the level of recruiting that we have. On the conference front for the year, we're really planning to return to in-person events, right, so that would likely bring our conference spend for the year back to pre-COVID levels. I'd estimate that around a $20 million increase for the full year '22 versus full year '21. And then lastly, the onboarding expenses associated with CUNA, right? Similar to M&T and BMO in '21, we'll have those expenses in '22 for CUNA. So those are really the 3 biggest drivers I'd highlight. Yes. We would typically see that happen, right? You get a normal build in the fourth quarter of each year, and you start to see those balances go back into the market in the first few months of the year. But with all the volatility we've seen this year and in this January, we've actually seen the cash balances continue to build. So they're up about another $1 billion for the month of January. I would emphasize, though, I think when volatility falls and things get back to normal, whatever your definition of normal is, I think we would expect to see that cash start to go back into the market. It's a lot of tax positioning, tax planning that you'd see in December, a lot of dividends and interest that come in. So it is very natural for that to get deployed back into the market in the coming months. Yes. Yes, definitely. I think when you look at our core technology portfolio investments there, which is driving that increase, we've been increasing that around 8% per year for a while, and we plan to do the same in 2022. I think what you're seeing, the big pickup is really the technology associated with integrating and onboarding Waddell & Reed, and we had a big deployment in that area in the fourth quarter that then is going to lead to that depreciation increasing in Q1. So I think the increase that may not make intuitive sense is really connected with the acquisition. We factor those costs into the overall multiple, which you can see in the materials we estimated 4.5x. So it's really the core portfolio growing at 8%, I think as -- think about that as the ongoing runway. Gerry, on the second part of your question on the cost front, I mean, the headline is that the costs that are included in our core G&A, included in core G&A guidance for 2022. So 7% to 9.5% range would include the cost of scale, our new services and specifically Business Solutions, as Dan just described. Yes, yes. I mean, I think it changed a little bit. I think the key is you saw the growth in those overflow balances in money markets and actually a slight decline in ICA. So while the sensitivities that are front and center in those bar charts went down a little bit, if you look at that footnote or the benefit associated with if and when those money market overflows go back into ICA, that actually went up, right? So it kind of shows up in a couple of different places, but it's just a mix, and we calculate those based on where we are at the end of the quarter. Yes, definitely. And it's where you just ended the question. So it's a combination of -- we've got 2 large -- 2 of our largest conferences in Q1. You're correct, there is large conferences in Q4 as well, but you now have more of an in-person expectations. You have overall a little bit of increase in conferences and then all the growth items that you described. So it's a little bit of both."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Jonathan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2021, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dream. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter and year of solid results while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.2 trillion, which was up approximately $300 billion or 34% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth, our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's Wealth Management business and complemented by equity market percentage. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $26 billion, which translated to 9% annualized growth driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. Over the past year, organic net new assets totaled $119 billion or 13% organic growth, up from 7% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion, bringing our full year total to $89 million, which is more than double a year ago. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, with the backdrop of a continued strong investor engagement, our advisers remain focused on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. As a result, advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing plans, a combination that continued to drive solid same-store sales. At the same time, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations model. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the fourth quarter and over the past year. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outlook with $1.63 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $7.02, an increase of 9% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plans. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire adviser centered marketplace, which for us means being the best of empowering advisers to deliver great advice to their client and to be great operators of their business. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to clients. And at the same time, through human-driven, technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary entrepreneurial. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work with 4 strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market. In our traditional markets, fourth quarter recruiting continued to be a significant source of growth with a new high of approximately $15 billion in assets. Ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA custody offering, we recruited approximately $2 billion in assets in fourth quarter. In each of these 3 models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipelines, which position them going forward for increased contributions to organic growth. Large financial institutions were a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&T and will continue to contribute this year with the planned onboarding of CUNA. Our insights and progress over the last 18 months have led to the continued enhancement of our value proposition. And consequently, our demand and pipeline in this market continue to build. Given our experience and more seasoned view from this work, we see large financial institutions as a more accessible market opportunity for us and another new and distinct affiliation model that can drive sustainable organic growth over time. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2022, we will maintain our focus on developing capabilities and solutions in 3 key areas. The first is to enrich the end-client experience with expanded digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business.  Second, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients with differentiated advice, products and pricing. Third, we will continue to advance client work to our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more clients, all of which contributes to enhanced performance of their practice. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention. Let's next move to our third strategic thing, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past 2 years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pure model, including voice, chat and digital support giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. In 2022, we will continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisers. Now this year, we will also advance to the next phase of our transformation, which is the streamlining and automation of our back-office operations. We will leverage Six Sigma process optimization and robotics and machine learning to reengineer our core clearing functions, including new account opening, transfers and money movement. These efforts will increase speed and accuracy for our advisers and their clients. In the future, we plan to extend this transformation from the service and operations organization to trading and compliance. Doing so better positions us to create frictionless, efficient processes throughout our operations that enhance service levels, delight advisers and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisers run the most successful businesses in the independent market. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisers more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. In the fourth quarter, our subscription base continued to grow, more than doubling year-over-year to approximately 3,000 subscribers, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. And while working with advisers on evolving our suite of business solutions, we identified a new category of opportunity that will help advisers more efficiently and effectively deliver comprehensive financial advice and planning solution. And to help solve for this need, we are innovating on services that provide expertise and leverage to do this planning in a scalable way across their entire client base. Our first offering in this area is paraplanning, which is a service that builds financial plans for advisers and then in turn utilize them to establish an investment strategy, help clients achieve their goals and objectives. This service launched last month and is receiving positive early feedback and engagement in the marketplace. We're also incubating other solutions, including tax planning and high network service.  As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio to help advisers run extraordinary businesses and provide differentiated planning and advice for their clients and, in turn, to drive gross profit and organic growth over time. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and, as a result, have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Alex, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. So look, I think we always look at sort of the structural opportunities, first and foremost, relative to organic growth. And as we stated in our remarks, right, you've got new store sales, you've got same-store sales, and then certainly retention. And as it relates to new store sales, again, I think the flexibility and optionality around our model, continued investment in differentiation and the capability side of our platform and then using our rate-driven sort of underwriting process, we think that is really a feel in combination that continues to create that sort of structural differentiation out in the marketplace as we move forward. And I think that drives the primary sort of activity and results at the end of the day. Now to your point, certainly, you have to overlay some market conditions that may influence that overall trajectory in the short run. There are cases to where you could have a significant market displacement that could occur that could temporarily disrupt the overall trend of opportunity out in the marketplace, i.e., advisers aren't moving as much because they're focused on those market conditions in serving and supporting their clients, and we've certainly seen that historically in the past. Up to this point, the volatility that we're seeing in the early part of the year, I think, is more aligned with sort of what we've played in the last couple of years. And so we're not seeing, thus far, some outsized impact for disruption in the overall movement out in the marketplace. I do think there's an overall, as we noted in our remarks, a bit slower movement in certain parts of the industry. But again, don't see necessarily thus far the macro influencing that. That's always subject to change if something more dramatic should shift as we move forward. And I think with respect to interest rates, you're suggesting is if there's greater economics built into recruiting, how does that influence transition assistance and/or financial incentives. And again, we've seen no reflection of changing in the underwriting across the marketplace. And we continue to use a return-based approach to that concept. And we factor in, certainly, I think, the characteristics of our overall economics factored in with the macro. And so again, we haven't seen any shift at this point in the overall pricing out in the marketplace for cost of acquisition. I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Thanks, Bill. So yes. Look, organic growth is a key part of our strategy, as we've talked about, and we've stayed very intentional and focused on how do we deliver those results. And I think if you think about our growth going forward, perhaps if you look at the last couple of years as a framework for that, you've got 7% growth in 2020 and 13% growth in 2021, and those are probably pretty nice bookends as a way to think about a range of potential growth over the long run or as we go forward. Obviously, as we talked about in the last question, macro conditions at any point in time, that influence that overall opportunity set. And I think, Bill, what we do to drive that, to get specifically to the second part of your question is we continue to look at investing in our traditional markets, growing the appeal of those markets, so it drives continued new store sales growth and continues to keep retention in that 2% range that we've talked about before. And we believe that investing in continued capabilities that help those advisers differentiate and win out in the marketplace is key to that. So think about that as focus #1. I think second is expanding and accelerating the growth in our new markets. And you said it, we see continued momentum building there. Some of that was a go-to-market. We're new to the marketplace. We continue to iterate and refine those models to make sure they're well positioned and appealing as they can be and create the value that they should for those different segments of the marketplace, and we're seeing that versatility and that flexibility ultimately open up new opportunities. And frankly, it's even helping advisers in our existing platform who have one model, and potentially were thinking about transition to another, staying on our platform because we have that flexibility now. And so we do see continued momentum there, and we've gotten off to a good start here in Q1 relative to the strategic wealth solution as an example. So continued growing contribution from those new markets. And financial institutions, what I was referring to as large financial institutions, this being somewhat of a new market for us. It wasn't a place that we always looked at for opportunity. I don't think we had demonstrated being able to bring a new solution to the marketplace that resonated, and it was actually a different contexted sort of solution for that segment of the marketplace. And I think through a couple of the wins that we've had, it's helped us learn, understand, refine and ultimately see that segment of the marketplace as a more sustainable avenue for growth and for contribution to come. So that's the way to think about the large financial institution markets, if that's helpful. And then finally, the last one is helping our existing advisers grow. And they've certainly done a great job of that over the last couple of years in tough markets, and we continue to see opportunity to invest to help them differentiate their advice, expand their advice, solve new problems for clients and generate net new assets from that. So those are the primary sort of drivers underneath that growth. And I think if you try to apply all of that to 2022, as we think about this year, knowing that a large financial institution is onboarding in CUNA in the first half of the year, we believe we're in the upper half range of that 7% to 13%. So hopefully, that gives you some helpful color. How about I take part A. Matt, take part B. So thanks for the question. And look, with respect to Business Solutions, just as a bit of a context, if you'll remember, that was an opportunity originally around this hypothesis of how do we help advisers, not only be great advisers, but to help them run private businesses. And we knew there was a significant amount of local level of spend that advisers are trying to help anything, accounting or bookkeeping to some sort of cash flow analysis to marketing support, tech support, all the things that you would think about in running a more entrepreneurial, smaller, midsized business. And so that was our original hypothesis.  And so as we've gotten in and continue to learn and serve and support them through our CFO solution, our marketing solution and our admin solution, I think those fundamentally and structurally resonate them and the needs that they have associated with those types of roles resonated. And what we've learned along the way, though, was there's also discrete problems that we can solve that don't require a full CFO. And we've been able to come up with sort of second-generation products, if you will, across the CFO and marketing landscape that expand our product offering, give different price points that make those services more and more accessible to more and more advisers. And so we will continue to innovate around what I would call the Business Services and think there's a significant room for opportunity when you look out overall -- advisers. And so those, again, I think, are really interesting, not only in the fundamental for initial offering, but multiple generations from their products in place. And I think at the same time, as we've been innovating and working on those types of solutions, we learn more and more about new ways of new things that advisers are trying to solve for, and that's where we came up with help with succession planning around assurance plan. So our M&A solutions where that was borne out of how we think about succession planning and selling my business or an adviser is going to grow through buying a business. And we realized that those were obstacles and [obstacles] typically don't do, and we could come in with some expertise and leverage and help them execute around that to make those possible. So solving specifically again in and around how do I grow in to think about succession planning have been valuable areas of innovation to help drive that subscription base. I think as we go forward, what we've also unlocked is a new category of opportunity where we will focus on helping them be great business owners. Now we've unlocked this opportunity where they may share, \u201chey, look, I want to provide a broader base of financial planning across my entire client base. I need some leverage to do that as that's time-consuming and hard to do.\u201d So hence, this concept of consulting them [indiscernible] do the plans for them to position them than to go build the financial strategy and investment strategy associated with that. And so this has unlocked this full new category of helping them expand and broaden for the comprehensive advice, which just makes them more appealing and differentiated from other options out in the marketplace and hence help us to further this. So that's opportunity set as we move forward with respect to business and solutions. And to some degree, some of the initial products that have helped us get where we are, I hope that helps. Thanks for the question. And yes, we are encouraged by the offering in the marketplace. And I think we probably -- when we first went to market with this solution, I think we've done some good research and insights, and all solid offering. But as people get in and begin to use that solution, you obviously begin to learn opportunities of probably creating some additional digital workflows that help them with efficiency inside the practices, which have being good feedback and learnings for us.  Continuing to more fully integrate some of our banking solutions was a another feedback that we've gotten that we've been working on to do that we think makes the solution more appealing. I think some of our high net worth solutions that we're working on have also been -- they've been a good source of feedback there to help us refine the development in those. So those are maybe some categories to think about where we've both made some improvements and continue to work to enhance the model. But I think foundation, if you think about 85%, 90% of the core solution and the feedback we're getting in the NPS scores that we're getting from this group, it would reflect a good, solid offering, delivering on what they had hoped, which is to help to transition to an independent practice and the ongoing support, operate a successful and independent business. So we feel good about where we are and continue to take that feedback and apply it to enhanced offering. Yes. I think you should think about that as the ongoing similar momentum that you've seen over the last year. With a bigger base requires obviously more incremental growth to create a doubling effect, if you will. But I do think that we've become better at offering these products. We've refined the existing version of products. And the new products coming out, that certainly will contribute to subscription growth. And again, we continue to try to refine our approach. And if we see opportunity or we've got gaps to fill in, then we certainly pivot and make those investments along the way. But I think the consistent sort of trajectory that we're on now feels like the best way to describe how we think about it over the next year. So if we go in reverse order, we are having more dialogue around the possibilities of serving or supporting larger financial institutions, also a larger set of institutions in different sort of categories. So that creates more dialogue and more opportunities. With respect to the planning around these, I think we've got to be thoughtful and diligent around not just thinking about winning those deals, but making sure that we execute well behind them. And you've got to be thoughtful about your funnel and the pacing of that. These are also longer sales cycles because they're more complex than our typical other business development efforts and activity. And so without giving you a perfect time line, I think we have to be thoughtful and factor in our ability to execute match with that demand and opportunity and then plan those out so that we execute them well.  It's also worked on the other side with these institutions to work through and think through doing that. And so they also have their own execution limitations, if you will, that we've got to collaborate and partner up with them. And so without giving you some specific time frame around when some next deal may come, I think we have active dialogue going on with a broader set of prospects and then we'll factor in their ability to execute, our ability to execute and time those in a way that makes sense for doing that well. Yes. I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next time. Have a good evening."

Over the past quarter, our advisors continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results. In the third quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.13 trillion, up 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, third quarter net new assets were $27 billion, which translated to 10% annualized growth, driven by continued strength across new store, sales, same-store sales, and retention. Over the past year, net new assets totaled $110 billion or 14% organic growth. In the third quarter recruited assets were $13 billion, which increased our total over the past year to $83 billion. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets. During the quarter, we continued to drive solid recruiting results across each of our markets, including $10 billion in our traditional independent model and $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. Multiple channels contributing to our growth better positions us to drive higher levels of recruiting over time. Looking at same-store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and expanding share of wallet with existing clients. A combination that drove same-store sales to new highs in the third quarter. At the same time, we further enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter and over the past year. In July, we on-boarded the advisors from Waddell & Reed and the final asset retention rate for the deal was approximately 99%. Currently, we are focused on the integration work to help these advisors optimally leverage our platform and support the growth of their businesses. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost, which is an increase of 23% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace. Our approach is to provide a platform that has the flexibility and personalization that make it simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice. We do this by providing advisors a breadth of the affiliation models, advisory platforms, investment content, technology, custody, and practice support that provides more flexibility in one place than anywhere else. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to an industry-leading advisor experience, continued solid organic growth, and increased market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in term. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. In our traditional markets, in the third quarter, we continue to increase our recruiting results, gain market share, and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite advisor movement remaining at lower levels. Looking at the large financial institutions marketplace, we on-boarded BMO Harris and M&T earlier this year and are applying the insights from those experiences to make our institutional offering even more robust and differentiated. This innovation and marketplace momentum are helping drive a solid pipeline with a growing number of prospects. As we look ahead, we are preparing to on-board CUNA Brokerage Services in the middle of next year and continue to see financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, the combination of a compelling value proposition and positive referrals from advisors using the new models are attracting more prospects and contributing to our growth. As a reminder, a year and a half ago, we launched Strategic Wealth Services and we have now added 17 practices, including eight in the past quarter. We subsequently brought our employee model to market later in the year and five practices have joined, including two over the past three months. Then earlier this year, we relaunched our RIA custody offering and have been encouraged by the number of RIAs, who quickly partnered with us. As we look ahead, we see these new affiliation models continuing to build momentum and becoming a larger contributor to our organic growth. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is the breadth and flexibility of our advisory platforms, from our turnkey centrally managed solutions to advisors managing portfolios themselves. This optionality is contributed to advisory now making up a majority of our total assets specifically within our centrally managed solutions with our ongoing investments in capabilities and pricing, our assets have increased to nearly $90 billion at an average annual organic growth rate of over 20% for the past five years. A key contributor to the growth of our centrally managed offerings is the increased personalization that enables advisors to use these solutions in the way that works best for them. For example, earlier this year, we introduced our Firm Sleeve solution, which together with Advisor Sleeve enables advisors and institutions to personalized centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models. We are now taking the next steps in this personalization journey by adding separately managed accounts while also integrating all centrally managed investment content into a single account for each client. These enhancements make it easier and more efficient for an advisor to expand the scope of their solutions while also providing a simpler and more unified experience which in turn contributes to the appeal and future growth of our centrally managed advisory solutions. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients and in turn, help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel Client Care Model. As a reminder, over the past year, we rolled out voice chat and digital help to our advisors giving them access to differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We are now focused on helping our advisors fully leveraged these channels to better serve their clients and more efficiently run their businesses. To further enhance our service model, we are also experimenting with specialized service pods designed specifically for different types of advisor practices. These pods include integrated teams comprised of service, case management, compliance, and relationship management. These experiments are helping us to tailor services based on advisors affiliation models and practice attributes and are making positive contributions to the advisor experience. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. Now, as we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our services portfolio. In the third quarter, our subscription base continued to grow more than doubling year over year to approximately 2600 subscriptions demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. We continue to innovate on our business solutions portfolio to expand the variety of needs we can solve for and provide a wider range of price points to enable a broader set of advisors to engage. One of our sources of innovation comes from advisor feedback on our existing solutions, which we use as a catalyst to iterate on our core offerings like CFO solutions. As an example, over the last year, this approach helped us identify several additional finance related needs for our advisors, which led to the development and launch of M&A solutions, Assurance Plan, and our book keeping pilot. Going forward, we will continue to leverage advisor feedback as fuel to expand our solutions portfolio. Now with the expansion and seasoning of our portfolio, the strategic value of business solutions also continues to expand and has become an important component of the value proposition and a contributor to growth and our new model such as Strategic Wealth Services. As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to innovate and expand the portfolio to increase the contribution to gross profit and organic growth. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients or driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remained focused on executing our strategy that help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of double-digit organic growth. In addition after on-boarding Waddell & Reed, BMO, and M&T, we continue to work with these advisors to acclimate and leverage our platform and capabilities, while also preparing to on-board CUNA in the middle of next year. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and grow our business. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.13 trillion up 2% from Q2. A key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $27 billion or a 10% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting, same-store sales, and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q3 recruited --in Q3, recruited assets were $13 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $83 billion. Moving onto our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $21 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are 52% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now, let's turn to our Q3 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77, up 23% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $631 million, up $29 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees, net of payout were $202 million, up $5 million from Q2, primarily driven by organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. In Q3, our payout ratio is 87.1%, up 80 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed, which earned a slightly lower payout on their platform. Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4. So, we anticipate our payout ratio will be up roughly 30 basis points sequentially to approximately 87.4%. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $210 million in Q3, up $21 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $91 million, up $1 million from Q2. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $51 billion, up $2 billion from last quarter. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q3, up 3 basis points from Q2. Now moving onto our fixed rate portfolio. In Q3, we added a new $1 billion fixed contract at the three-year point of the curve, which was about 45 basis points at the time and as a reminder, at the end of the third quarter, we also had a fixed rate maturity of $2.3 billion yielding approximately 160 basis points. As we look ahead to Q4, given these factors and where interest rates, client rates, and cash balances are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decline by approximately 5 basis points. Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues. There were $140 million, up $3 million sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from our national adviser conference and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. Looking ahead to Q4, based on the lower trading levels we've seen so far in October and the typical seasonal increase in IRA fees, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in line with Q3. Turning to business solutions. We ended the quarter with approximately 2600 subscriptions, which is up 500 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $25 million of annual revenue and more importantly, they contribute to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales, and retention. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $271 million in Q3, up $19 million sequentially driven by a full quarter of Waddell & Reed and continued investment to drive and support organic growth. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are tightening our 2021 core G&A outlook to a range of $990 million to $1 billion and given our current rate of organic growth, we expect to be in the upper half of that range. Additionally, now that we have on board Waddell & Reed and have a better sense of the timing of those expenses, we will include those costs in our overall outlook going forward. As a result, we expect Waddell & Reed to add $55 million to $60 million to our outlook, which brings our total 2021 core G&A outlook to $1 billion 45 million to $1 billion 60 million. Moving on to Q3 promotional expenses. They were $84 million, up $20 million sequentially primarily driven by meeting expense as two of our largest advisor conferences took place in Q3. Turning to Q4, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by a couple of million dollars sequentially. Driven by transition assistance, large financial institution on boarding expenses, and advisor conferences that we were scheduled to Q4 from earlier in the year. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. In July, we completed the onboarding, which resulted in 99% of client assets joining our platform, up from 98% estimated last quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $50 million in Q3 and we anticipate it ramping to approximately $60 million in Q4 as we build toward $85 million run rate by the middle of next year. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q3 with the leverage ratio at 2.2 times and corporate cash of $266 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocated capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and M&A as well as restarted our share repurchase program buying back $40 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q4 while remaining flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital to drive growth emerge. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue invest in to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you very much. So just wanted to circle back to maybe some of the recruiting trends you spoke to, it sounds like you have a few more things in the hopper in the bank channel side. I was wondering if you, maybe you could flush that out a little bit. And then on the business solutions sort of wondering on your huge step up sequentially. Where do you think you are in terms of your penetration rate of your base FAs and maybe some update as it relates to the beta test outside of your core footprint? Thank you\nDan Arnold: Bill. So, let me take those on the, I think on the institutional front, which may have been your first question in terms of and how we think about that opportunity and see that and how we see the opportunity going forward. So look at the short answer is, we're excited about the opportunities across both the traditional bank outsourcing markets - that's your bank and credit even in the outsourcing market and then the new large institution market and just pursue those opportunities we continue to invest in our capabilities to make the model more appealing as a driver of growth across what is a collective $1 trillion market opportunity as you know. So again, I think we're well positioned to win the day and as we enhance our capabilities, we think that distinguishes our value proposition going forward. And we continue to be active and exploring those possibilities across that entire landscape. We see our pipeline continuing to grow and without giving you specific some, we have good confidence that we can continue to see this - this financial institution space as an ongoing sustainable and multi-year contributor to our organic growth. So that's, I think question number one. With your second question on with respect to our business solutions. So look, we have lots of opportunity here, right. This is a, this is a new offering where we continue to both take our core offering and expand it. So you think about starting with three to four professional services and how do you then broaden if you will, the reach across multiple different solutions inside the LPL advisor base. And so for there, I think that's predominantly where that 1200 subscriptions sit today. We do believe there is significant upside to continue to drive that penetration as we refine the value propositions of those offerings and we expand the number of solutions that we offer at different price points, you really significantly increase the available market within side that 20,000 advisors, and so we do believe that we're just in the logical normal early innings part of a 9-inning ballgame around the existing advisors on the LPL platform. So, I think that I hope that helps in terms of giving you that directional opportunity, I think when you explore outside the LPL platform, our priority is focused on the LPL platform today, so the only place we've experimented outside is with M&A solutions where I think it's very logical that you would, we would be interested in getting both potential buyers and sellers outside of the LPL platform to enrich our M&A solutions, our offering in the breadth of that marketplace. And so we continue to experiment there. We haven't done any deals outside of the LPL advisor family today, but we continue to explore that possibility. So, again we're just very early into exploring offering that type of solution outside the LPL advisor. I hope that helps.\nBill Katz: Okay, thanks. And maybe a follow-up for Matt would be, and thanks for taking the questions. Just in terms of your new guidance, how much of that is sort of inflation pressures we're sort of hearing that across companies that are reporting versus just maybe a step-up of recruitment. And then how do you think about the interplay for next year. I know it's obviously early days, but as we should think about maybe the relationship between growth and spent? Thank you.\nMattAudette: Sure. Bill, I think when you look at the updated guidance for this quarter, it's really our where we land on our expenses within that range is really driven by organic growth in the cost and specifically the variable costs associated with supporting it. And so I think when you look at our growth this year, in the last 12 months, call it in the 14% range, well into double-digits that's what's driving us up to the higher end of that range, but I just emphasize is still within the, within the range that we started for this year. As we look ahead to next year, I mean I think we're in the midst of planning for that right now. As you can imagine. And I think we'll talk a little bit about that and give you some guidance as we typically do on next quarter's call. The thing I'd emphasize now is we're approaching it the same way we typically do and focusing in on the same core principles, which are investing to drive and support organic growth and at the same time, really focusing on delivering operating leverage. Right. So those principles will, will remain and our quarter our planning and we'll give you an update next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your question please\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good afternoon, Matt, Dan. Maybe just starting off with a question on the ICA strategy. I was hoping you could provide Matt some perspective as to how demand is evolving with really high expectations getting pulled forward, whether there is any market differences in demand for floating versus fixed rate contracts, and given the increase in three to five-year swap rates, I think they're now at about 90 to 120 bps. How is it, what's your appetite at least today to do additional extensions?\nMattAudette: Yes, Steve. And I think when you look at the market today, right. It's both from a demand standpoint as well as pricing I the headline to give is it's looking better. Right. Both on the floating side, on the fixed side, I think to click down on that, on the floating rate side and while emphasizing, we haven't seen a broad-based return of demand. We are starting to have more conversations and those conversations are about folks coming to market, Fed funds plus 5 basis point zone versus if you go back the last few quarters, it's really been Fed funds flat or basically sure, I'll take your money, but it's one basis point, that's it. So, the dialog there is certainly improving. And on the fixed rate side, just the say, we're starting to have dialog there and I think you hit it well in your question as the, as the yield curve starts to steepen, there's just economics in there that banks cannot on their side. So, the dialog there is picking up and you can see we've, this is the second quarter in a row, we've been able to, to put a new fixed rate contracts. So the headline I give you is things are looking better just based on the dialogs that we're having. I think to the last part of your question on our appetite on how and when to fix out, our focus in philosophy there is really unchanged, and that's ultimately wanting to be at a place where the fixed component of the portfolio is in the 50% to 75% range and in periods of low late rates, I think we'd say closer to the low end of that range and in periods of higher rates, especially with some steepness to the curve we'd say closer to 75%. Right. So, we're sitting at 25% today. So I think as opportunity start to emerge and we're able to take advantage of that and deploy that in a fixed rate I think would be interested in doing so once that demand comes back. So, I think if, if what we're hearing, this quarter continues. I think you'd start to see some, some more demand in future quarters.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that color. And maybe for my follow-up. It's actually one of the same lines of what Bill just asked on the expense side, maybe taking a slightly different tack. Matt, I know when you had initially laid out the core G&A growth guidance last year the 5.5% to 8% growth, you talked about half of that growth being allocated towards efforts to accelerate organic growth in your traditional markets. The other half allocated towards some newer initiatives expanding the addressable TAM or market. As organic growth has accelerated, I understand that there is some upward pressure, but I just want to get a sense as to whether that philosophy still holds in terms of what's going to drive core G&A growth from here? And also wanted to you to provide some context around the promotional side, given that's the biggest area of upward expense pressure that we saw in the quarter, certainly higher than what we had been contemplating and how we should think about the growth in promotional from here given some of those upward pressures and the competitive environment?\nMattAudette: Yes. Is that I think Steve as like a four-part question on how we've been going - I think on the core G&A going forward. I think that if you build on the focus on investing and spending to drive organic growth, It's tied really to that. So, if you look at our plans for next year that will, we'll share next quarter that working through, whether it'd be growth in traditional markets. I think you heard a lot from Dan in the prepared remarks on how the new models are growing, and we've talked a bit about on this call and how business solutions is growing. So, I think it's going to all be tied to growth. I think the split that we talked about this year, we'll see if that same split plays out next year, but at its core, it's really investing to drive organic growth, while at the same time balancing, delivering, operating leverage to the bottom line. On the promotional side, I think the headline I would give you there. As we look ahead to 2022, is there's really two drivers of promotional one growth in the business overall. And then two our conferences and I think when you look at growth of the business overall, a little bit similar to what I was just talking about on core G&A. The drivers are really going to be the transition assistance associated with advisors joining our platform and the onboarding expenses for some of the larger ones associated with that. So as you, as you start to look at what we've delivered over the recent periods, right hitting new highs for organic growth in our traditional markets, right having a full year of the larger wins like BMO an M&T on the platform, onboarding CUNA in the middle of next year and then of course beyond organic growth and Waddell having a full-year effect of that, so that's going to be the big driver on the TA side. On the conferences side, I think like most folks and we really pulled back on conferences last year in 2020 given the, I think the obvious COVID environment. This year we've face those back in. But I'd say we're not at pre-COVID levels. So, I think we're still working and planning on this for 2022. But, I think we'll be looking to balance what I think we are quite confident is a positive return on conferences in person just a few we've done recently, I can tell you that the returns have been quite good, just given the excitement in the interaction folks have both us as employees in the home office as well as advisors getting to see each other. While at the same time, I think taking advantage of the digital capabilities that we've deployed, this year as well as managing costs and the safety of those attending. So that's something that will come together next quarter, but the headline for you on promotional is it's about growth overall and then really how the conference plans land.\nSteven Chubak: Knocked all four out. Thanks so much for taking my questions, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon guys. All right. So, we'll continue with the multipart questions I guess to keep everybody awake, so essentially managed really nice growth, obviously good organic growth, good asset growth. How do you see sort of the internal addressable market in this part of the model? Is that something that you see advisor sort of switching from somebody else like external TAMs or these new folks that are, have not really use these services before? And maybe just remind us on the economics again, kind of, how does LPA, LPL ultimately makes money on this? Does that show up in advisory or does it show up in other? So, just a little bit more granularity, that would be great. Thanks.\nDan Arnold: I'll take the first part of that. Matt, you take the second. So, Alex with respect to where the opportunity sets coming from I think your question set it up well, for the most part, it's new advisors coming onto our platform that will move from some other solution that they had been using wherever they came from. So that's obviously one driver of growth. A second driver of growth as we're seeing more and more advisors utilize essentially managed solutions versus Rep as PM or constructing their own portfolios for the efficiency gains for the opportunities of which to create some professional leverage points that allow them free, free up time to do other things, I think is a positive trade. So, the more we add capability to this and lower the cost, the more and more of, that's a logical trade for them. So that is the second component. And then I think the third is that you just continue to have this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory, which is obviously a tailwind across the entire advisory platform including centrally managed. So, you might, you might think about it through those three drivers.\nMattAudette: And then. Alex, just on the economics. I think when you look at the long-term trends where interest rates are, is going to impact the numbers overall, but just to give you a sense of the different platforms. I think we, when you look at brokerage assets from an ROA standpoint, our gross profit ROA standpoint. They have been in the 15 plus, 15 to 20 zone depending on where interest rates are. When you move into the advisory platforms, it's about 10 basis points above that. And then within the advisory platforms when you move into essentially managed, it's another 10 basis points on average above that. So hope that helps on the economic side.\nAlex Blostein: Yes, that's great. And then a follow-up on Waddell, so $85 million plus an EBITDA contribution middle of next year. Can you help us frame the opportunity around the plus, how much of that would be sort of cross selling, how much of that would be maybe accelerated growth for Waddell advisors, are there additional kind of cost-cutting measures that are maybe embedded in the plus piece? Just trying to frame what the opportunity could be? Thanks.\nMattAudette: Yes. Yes, definitely, I think, future growth would be, it would be above and beyond that, I think when you look at our moving Waddell onto our platform and then what we've done so far through the quarter is really getting the synergies on the revenue of the gross profit side as we move them onto our platform move them off of their custodian and I think from this point forward, it's really about the work on expense synergies. Right. The natural things that you would do in a corporate integration that we plan to get done by the middle of next year. So the plus on $85 plus is really just that work. And if that goes better than estimated at this point that's where the plus could come from.\nDan Arnold: Yes, I think. Alex, just to add to that. Beyond that you would begin to factoring can we support and help their same-store sales growth, expand their utilization of advisory platforms et cetera. So those are, those are things that aren't necessarily contemplated that in the short run.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just hoping you could update us on the digital offering what that looks like today and how do you expect that offering to evolve over the next 12-24 months, maybe you can give us a sense of what's next on the to-do list there?\nDan Arnold: Michael, just for purposes of a little bit of distinction are you talking about for the end client or for the advisor, or both?\nMichael Cyprys: Both, please.\nDan Arnold: Yes, so for the advisor, we continue to see an income, an important part of the overall value proposition being the operating platform of which we provide them with that digital platform. So, anything that we can do that helps them operationally simplify what they do straight through processing, easy user interfaces that make for simple clicks to ultimately kick off a series of integrated workflows, those are great outcomes. And so that's where we think about this digital platform of which helping our advisors in terms of simplifying the overall day to day processing and drive efficiencies into their work. I think the second place that we think about is how do we add and enhance robotics AI into these overall systems to improve and enhance the efficacy of those systems. So, think about improving and enhancing our overall collaborative risk management with them would be another place. So you streamline, how you think about risk management, you have systems that are more efficient and effective at overall assessing some said risk and collaborating and working together with them is another opportunity and maybe a third one is, how do we help them with respect to prospective insights or trends that are occurring within their client base and how to position to better serve or support them or take a certain action. So, that might be three places in a wide spectrum of areas that we see is big opportunities on the, what I would call the advisor platform. And that's what we sometimes refer to as client works, as an operating platform or client works connected where we're actually streamlining workflows. With respect to the, to the end investor that's been a place of investment for us. That is not historically been a place that we - necessarily played into create great value and in the last four years, we've pivoted pretty significantly and are trying to create what I would call a digital platform that we wrap around the advisors, not meant to replace the advisors, actually meant to enhance the advisors value proposition to the client and enrich how they show up for that advisor. So, think about the combination of the advisors professional IP together with a really modernized digital experience around that and so we're investing in our digital capabilities in order to achieve that. So, anything from your standard ability to initiate and kick off workflows by the end investor to having robust content that provides them insights on industry opportunities within their portfolios to just the standard data they may need to better manage their account, when they want to, however they want to, sort of meeting them where they are. So, we see that is a really robust and ongoing place to invest as we think about transforming that over time into smarter, more intuitive AI driven opportunities to make sure we're there when client, we're there with the advisor when the client needs us most.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks for that. Just as a follow-up. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on the traction you were seeing in the RIA custody offering and the momentum there, maybe you could comment on how many advisors have partnered with you since the re-launch of that, but the feedback has been and what sort of actions that you're taking here to enhance the growth and enhance the offering?\nDan Arnold: Yes. In that case we were, as I had mentioned to you before, we were already a custodian if you will for RIAs. We just had done it in a more defensive posture and so we've been investing to streamline and improve the efficiency and experience that we can deliver as a custodian for someone, who is just focused on RIA business or advisory business. So, one that's been up. I would call it a year journey to improve that. We're still working on that, but we feel good about that journey in that trajectory. And then the second thing that we've done is we've added resources to focus on growing this business and hence the combination of those intersection point launching this last spring and we've had some what is what we expected was a trajectory very similar to our Swiss model or LPL employee model where you sort of build and ramped in and, and I would say that we were pleased that the quick response we and the interest that we've had in that custodial side that exceeded a bit of the ramp that we saw in those other models and so we still have some iteration and work to do as we learn to get feedback from those advisors that have joined us, but it's been a small handful today and the pipeline is interesting. And again we've got business development resources that are focused on going out and winning this business. So, I think you should think about it as we've seen the trajectory of those other two models. We do think it will follow a similar pattern. I'll buy it. We've got a faster start out of the gates. But, we think it will, it will follow a similar trajectory if you will, of growing into that. So it's very, very early on and we are establishing ourselves as a market player, a competitor, who has a viable competitive offering capability set that's competitively priced and now we've got to go out and sell it and pull those deals through. So, I think there's more to come on that. It's just really early and pleased that the quick response that we've had, we've onboarded several advisors and we've got a good solid pipeline building.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for taking my questions. Matt, I just was curious about squaring a couple of the comments on the ICA dynamics and how they've been changing, it looks like the money fund balances went up in the quarter a decent amount. But yet, I think you indicated that the floaters, the ICA floaters, we're now Fed funds plus 5, so maybe could you help me square why the money fund balances were gone up if the floaters are looking more attractive or was it that that's now post 09/30 and that's the current environment and so we should expect those money fund balances to move out and move into the floaters?\nMattAudette: Yes, sure, Brian. So two different things going on, on floating rate dialog in the Fed funds plus 5 zone. I was just giving some color on what the dialog is in the current market. Right, We've got no new contracts there. Just to try and give a sense now that there is some steepness to the curve, that folks are starting to engage at a place that I think is constructive versus in the past it's been one basis point and a lot of cases. So, I think I just look to future quarters will update on how that's going, I'll just give you a sense as to the dialog in the marketplace right now. On the money fund side, that's a little bit different. I think what you see happening there is really the overflow capacity that we have where there's really two types of overflow. It can be, in ICA contracts or bank contracts or money markets and the capacity in that part of the market is really primarily coming from money markets. Could you can imagine on that type of short-term money the banks don't have a lot of economics and therefore don't have a lot of demand for it versus the money funds don't have the similar balance sheet constraints. So, that's where you just see a lot more demand there. Now those are overflow so kind of to square that back with the first part of your question, when demand does return those balances will naturally go back into whether it be floating rate contracts or fixed rate contracts whenever the capacity returns. It's a little bit of two different things going on there.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Okay, thanks. And then on promotion. I know the there, you had referenced that there's a lot of flux going on in the conference world, which is totally understandable. Normally, if we go back to pre-2020, 3Q to 4Q you guys typically have a pretty decent drop, about a $10 million or $12 million drop in conference expense quarter over quarter. With that, I'm trying to think about the promotional indication of up a few million quarter-over-quarter would that typical seasonal pattern of the conference expense decline in the fourth quarter and therefore the TA amortization would continue to ramp or is this year going to look a little different on the conference end of things, I know it's a ticky tacky question, just want to get it straight?\nMattAudette: Yes. No worries. Yes, I think the last part, you said there this year is a little bit different and I think the key is when you look at, when you look at last year for conferences, mean in Q4 of 2020 we really didn't have any conference spend just given COVID in the environment when typically you would have it spread throughout the year. And then when you look at our plans for this year, even though we have a return to pre-COVID levels we've really scheduled. The conference is almost entirely in the second half of the year. So, when you get into the Q4 21 versus Q4 2020 comparison, it's just a little bit of an abnormal year where you've got basically half of our conference spend this year in Q4 when to your point, historically would typically see a decline. So it's just a little bit of a different year.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. So more like a flat quarter-over-quarter conference dynamic than the typical drop?\nMattAudette: Yes. And I think my comments in the prepared remarks just promotional up a couple million next quarter which to your point is likely driven by growth in TA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Gerry, please make sure your line is unmuted and if in a speaker phone lift your handset.\nGerry O'Hara: Great, thanks. Sorry about that long day. Anyway, Dan, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about the traditional markets continuing obviously to be strong for you all despite lower assets in motion. If, I kind of got that correctly. So hoping you might be able to kind of flush out that dynamic a little bit whether that's just sort of a slowing in the breakaway broker trend, whether it's a little bit more near-term, or if it's just kind of more secular in nature, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yes, I think, where I mean in the traditional markets or maybe the advisor movement. I don't actually mean to reflect those that are moving out of the warehouses, I actually a more reflecting the movement within the independent space and I do think that's more timing than anything. I think you had lots of folks that are already in the independent space with some of the success that they're having in the marketplace today and growing their practices and supporting their clients, as well as you just add to the complexity of coming out of a significant amount of change in the prior year due to the COVID environment. I think it's much more circumstantial than it is some structural shift in terms of the advisor movement in the independent space, but I do think that's probably reflective of the balance of this year and as we get to a place where we think, hopefully the COVID environment more normalizing, I think you'll see people ramped back up continuing to explore the strategic options versus just tactically managing their business. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Good afternoon. I think you want to come back to the conversation we're just having now about kind of independent broker movement and yes I guess it's a longer-term point of view, again you're just talking about, you think about the market. I mean there still huge fragmentation smaller group of scale players. If you just think about the past year and a half or so, I mean it just feels like the leaders are separating themselves and it's more obvious just around technology some of things you guys are talking about on service and just the evolution of the model. And so what does this kind of to talk a bit about how this plays out longer term and just the consolidation of the market to the larger firms, is this clearly being going on for years. You guys have been a winner of that, but what point if at all, it does, it really kind of accelerate. It feels like there's maybe some inertia right now and to your point, yes, there is some friction in trying to move after kind of a lot of change over the past year. But, why aren't advisor is kind of long-term kind of going towards where there's just, it feels like tremendous value relative to some of the smaller platform just aren't could be able to keep up technology wise or service wise or with some of the innovation that a large firms are bringing. So it's kind of tailoring on the prior question, but would love a little more detail there?\nDan Arnold: Yes, sure. And so, as you say, outside of the current environment. Right. We do see that structural trend from moving from a - from let's call it a smaller provider to one that has more capabilities or higher quality capabilities that are going to help them better serve their clients, so that trend did exist today, even in this environment, and we do expect it to continue. Now as we are able to invest more robustly in new capabilities, new opportunities, new economics. I think that will only accelerate that trend, Devin. And then at some point when it hits one of those firms hard enough, then you will see as you say the capitulation point of trading the franchise and so we do expect that trend to continue. I think we, why we lead with organic growth and why we're so committed to investing in our capabilities to further enhance the appeal of the model, because we do see the independent space as a robust opportunity to continue to fuel our organic growth. Now the nice thing is, is you have the flexibility of the models that we offer now, right. We can take those investments and across these different models create a much bigger opportunity set from that growing appeal in this broadened available market and so much like we see that continued trend from the all captive to the independent model. We continue to expect that to accelerate and evolve and obviously we're playing or trying to in a significant way to be a participant in that. So, I think you've got it right. I think those structural trends continue and at some point on an individual sort of basis these companies will hit an inflection point where they feel like strategically, it makes more sense to explore some sort of transaction and certainly we're positioned to participate in that market at right valuations. So I hope that helps.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. I appreciate it. Thanks, Dan and quick follow up here. You may have hit this, but on commissions, just a little step back on particularly sales commissions of what I'm looking at here, more step back in the quarter. Is it seasonality or is this kind of kind of the right level maybe last quarter was a little more active above average, just any color on how to think about the trajectory and whether it was just a lighter quarter because either again some seasonality or people was engaged. Any color on how to think about the quarter for commissions, but maybe modeling going forward as well?\nDan Arnold: Yes. that makes sense. And not to be overly precise, I would, as you say, look at it over a broader set of data than just one quarter. Naturally speaking, you've some, some elements of seasonality inside the third quarter because of the July, August timeframe or summer time frames, which sometimes reduces activity. And so, that said again without trying to make that the specific correlation here I kind of look at it more broadly over the last 12 months and you have seen some sustained elevated levels from where, from our jumping-off point in the prior 12 months. Right. And I think you've got a couple of things going on to think about summer are in market driven. You've got good solid equity performance in the market. You've got good liquidity in the market, which certainly drive some activity, coupled with I think ongoing rising interest rate environments will create more opportunities for certain brokerage solutions to be offered, think about things like annuities. So, those are some things to think about in the macro, I think when you think about our structural opportunities certainly the growing number of advisors we have will lead to more commission-based and sales-based business. And then on the sort of that same sort of structural concept that you've got the headwind of this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory and those are the sort of the drivers of the inputs that I would think about as you think about the opportunity set going forward. But look, I think the last couple of quarters, if you look at those across that entire sort of spectrum, you've got a logical sort of level of activity that I think reflects the current market environment. Hope that helps.\nOperator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dan Arnold for closing remarks. Sir.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Hey, thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we know it's a busy day for you. So, we really appreciate the time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of double-digit organic growth. In addition after on-boarding Waddell & Reed, BMO, and M&T, we continue to work with these advisors to acclimate and leverage our platform and capabilities, while also preparing to on-board CUNA in the middle of next year. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and grow our business. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.13 trillion up 2% from Q2. A key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $27 billion or a 10% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting, same-store sales, and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q3 recruited --in Q3, recruited assets were $13 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $83 billion. Moving onto our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $21 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are 52% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now, let's turn to our Q3 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77, up 23% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $631 million, up $29 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees, net of payout were $202 million, up $5 million from Q2, primarily driven by organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. In Q3, our payout ratio is 87.1%, up 80 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed, which earned a slightly lower payout on their platform. Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4. So, we anticipate our payout ratio will be up roughly 30 basis points sequentially to approximately 87.4%. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $210 million in Q3, up $21 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $91 million, up $1 million from Q2. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $51 billion, up $2 billion from last quarter. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q3, up 3 basis points from Q2. Now moving onto our fixed rate portfolio. In Q3, we added a new $1 billion fixed contract at the three-year point of the curve, which was about 45 basis points at the time and as a reminder, at the end of the third quarter, we also had a fixed rate maturity of $2.3 billion yielding approximately 160 basis points. As we look ahead to Q4, given these factors and where interest rates, client rates, and cash balances are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decline by approximately 5 basis points. Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues. There were $140 million, up $3 million sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from our national adviser conference and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. Looking ahead to Q4, based on the lower trading levels we've seen so far in October and the typical seasonal increase in IRA fees, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in line with Q3. Turning to business solutions. We ended the quarter with approximately 2600 subscriptions, which is up 500 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $25 million of annual revenue and more importantly, they contribute to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales, and retention. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $271 million in Q3, up $19 million sequentially driven by a full quarter of Waddell & Reed and continued investment to drive and support organic growth. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are tightening our 2021 core G&A outlook to a range of $990 million to $1 billion and given our current rate of organic growth, we expect to be in the upper half of that range. Additionally, now that we have on board Waddell & Reed and have a better sense of the timing of those expenses, we will include those costs in our overall outlook going forward. As a result, we expect Waddell & Reed to add $55 million to $60 million to our outlook, which brings our total 2021 core G&A outlook to $1 billion 45 million to $1 billion 60 million. Moving on to Q3 promotional expenses. They were $84 million, up $20 million sequentially primarily driven by meeting expense as two of our largest advisor conferences took place in Q3. Turning to Q4, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by a couple of million dollars sequentially. Driven by transition assistance, large financial institution on boarding expenses, and advisor conferences that we were scheduled to Q4 from earlier in the year. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. In July, we completed the onboarding, which resulted in 99% of client assets joining our platform, up from 98% estimated last quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $50 million in Q3 and we anticipate it ramping to approximately $60 million in Q4 as we build toward $85 million run rate by the middle of next year. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q3 with the leverage ratio at 2.2 times and corporate cash of $266 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocated capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and M&A as well as restarted our share repurchase program buying back $40 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q4 while remaining flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital to drive growth emerge. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue invest in to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Sure. Bill, I think when you look at the updated guidance for this quarter, it's really our where we land on our expenses within that range is really driven by organic growth in the cost and specifically the variable costs associated with supporting it. And so I think when you look at our growth this year, in the last 12 months, call it in the 14% range, well into double-digits that's what's driving us up to the higher end of that range, but I just emphasize is still within the, within the range that we started for this year. As we look ahead to next year, I mean I think we're in the midst of planning for that right now. As you can imagine. And I think we'll talk a little bit about that and give you some guidance as we typically do on next quarter's call. The thing I'd emphasize now is we're approaching it the same way we typically do and focusing in on the same core principles, which are investing to drive and support organic growth and at the same time, really focusing on delivering operating leverage. Right. So those principles will, will remain and our quarter our planning and we'll give you an update next quarter. Yes, Steve. And I think when you look at the market today, right. It's both from a demand standpoint as well as pricing I the headline to give is it's looking better. Right. Both on the floating side, on the fixed side, I think to click down on that, on the floating rate side and while emphasizing, we haven't seen a broad-based return of demand. We are starting to have more conversations and those conversations are about folks coming to market, Fed funds plus 5 basis point zone versus if you go back the last few quarters, it's really been Fed funds flat or basically sure, I'll take your money, but it's one basis point, that's it. So, the dialog there is certainly improving. And on the fixed rate side, just the say, we're starting to have dialog there and I think you hit it well in your question as the, as the yield curve starts to steepen, there's just economics in there that banks cannot on their side. So, the dialog there is picking up and you can see we've, this is the second quarter in a row, we've been able to, to put a new fixed rate contracts. So the headline I give you is things are looking better just based on the dialogs that we're having. I think to the last part of your question on our appetite on how and when to fix out, our focus in philosophy there is really unchanged, and that's ultimately wanting to be at a place where the fixed component of the portfolio is in the 50% to 75% range and in periods of low late rates, I think we'd say closer to the low end of that range and in periods of higher rates, especially with some steepness to the curve we'd say closer to 75%. Right. So, we're sitting at 25% today. So I think as opportunity start to emerge and we're able to take advantage of that and deploy that in a fixed rate I think would be interested in doing so once that demand comes back. So, I think if, if what we're hearing, this quarter continues. I think you'd start to see some, some more demand in future quarters. Yes. Is that I think Steve as like a four-part question on how we've been going - I think on the core G&A going forward. I think that if you build on the focus on investing and spending to drive organic growth, It's tied really to that. So, if you look at our plans for next year that will, we'll share next quarter that working through, whether it'd be growth in traditional markets. I think you heard a lot from Dan in the prepared remarks on how the new models are growing, and we've talked a bit about on this call and how business solutions is growing. So, I think it's going to all be tied to growth. I think the split that we talked about this year, we'll see if that same split plays out next year, but at its core, it's really investing to drive organic growth, while at the same time balancing, delivering, operating leverage to the bottom line. On the promotional side, I think the headline I would give you there. As we look ahead to 2022, is there's really two drivers of promotional one growth in the business overall. And then two our conferences and I think when you look at growth of the business overall, a little bit similar to what I was just talking about on core G&A. The drivers are really going to be the transition assistance associated with advisors joining our platform and the onboarding expenses for some of the larger ones associated with that. So as you, as you start to look at what we've delivered over the recent periods, right hitting new highs for organic growth in our traditional markets, right having a full year of the larger wins like BMO an M&T on the platform, onboarding CUNA in the middle of next year and then of course beyond organic growth and Waddell having a full-year effect of that, so that's going to be the big driver on the TA side. On the conferences side, I think like most folks and we really pulled back on conferences last year in 2020 given the, I think the obvious COVID environment. This year we've face those back in. But I'd say we're not at pre-COVID levels. So, I think we're still working and planning on this for 2022. But, I think we'll be looking to balance what I think we are quite confident is a positive return on conferences in person just a few we've done recently, I can tell you that the returns have been quite good, just given the excitement in the interaction folks have both us as employees in the home office as well as advisors getting to see each other. While at the same time, I think taking advantage of the digital capabilities that we've deployed, this year as well as managing costs and the safety of those attending. So that's something that will come together next quarter, but the headline for you on promotional is it's about growth overall and then really how the conference plans land. And then. Alex, just on the economics. I think when you look at the long-term trends where interest rates are, is going to impact the numbers overall, but just to give you a sense of the different platforms. I think we, when you look at brokerage assets from an ROA standpoint, our gross profit ROA standpoint. They have been in the 15 plus, 15 to 20 zone depending on where interest rates are. When you move into the advisory platforms, it's about 10 basis points above that. And then within the advisory platforms when you move into essentially managed, it's another 10 basis points on average above that. So hope that helps on the economic side. Yes. Yes, definitely, I think, future growth would be, it would be above and beyond that, I think when you look at our moving Waddell onto our platform and then what we've done so far through the quarter is really getting the synergies on the revenue of the gross profit side as we move them onto our platform move them off of their custodian and I think from this point forward, it's really about the work on expense synergies. Right. The natural things that you would do in a corporate integration that we plan to get done by the middle of next year. So the plus on $85 plus is really just that work. And if that goes better than estimated at this point that's where the plus could come from. Yes, sure, Brian. So two different things going on, on floating rate dialog in the Fed funds plus 5 zone. I was just giving some color on what the dialog is in the current market. Right, We've got no new contracts there. Just to try and give a sense now that there is some steepness to the curve, that folks are starting to engage at a place that I think is constructive versus in the past it's been one basis point and a lot of cases. So, I think I just look to future quarters will update on how that's going, I'll just give you a sense as to the dialog in the marketplace right now. On the money fund side, that's a little bit different. I think what you see happening there is really the overflow capacity that we have where there's really two types of overflow. It can be, in ICA contracts or bank contracts or money markets and the capacity in that part of the market is really primarily coming from money markets. Could you can imagine on that type of short-term money the banks don't have a lot of economics and therefore don't have a lot of demand for it versus the money funds don't have the similar balance sheet constraints. So, that's where you just see a lot more demand there. Now those are overflow so kind of to square that back with the first part of your question, when demand does return those balances will naturally go back into whether it be floating rate contracts or fixed rate contracts whenever the capacity returns. It's a little bit of two different things going on there. Yes. No worries. Yes, I think the last part, you said there this year is a little bit different and I think the key is when you look at, when you look at last year for conferences, mean in Q4 of 2020 we really didn't have any conference spend just given COVID in the environment when typically you would have it spread throughout the year. And then when you look at our plans for this year, even though we have a return to pre-COVID levels we've really scheduled. The conference is almost entirely in the second half of the year. So, when you get into the Q4 21 versus Q4 2020 comparison, it's just a little bit of an abnormal year where you've got basically half of our conference spend this year in Q4 when to your point, historically would typically see a decline. So it's just a little bit of a different year. Yes. And I think my comments in the prepared remarks just promotional up a couple million next quarter which to your point is likely driven by growth in TA."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Latif, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results. In the third quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.13 trillion, up 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, third quarter net new assets were $27 billion, which translated to 10% annualized growth, driven by continued strength across new store, sales, same-store sales, and retention. Over the past year, net new assets totaled $110 billion or 14% organic growth. In the third quarter recruited assets were $13 billion, which increased our total over the past year to $83 billion. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets. During the quarter, we continued to drive solid recruiting results across each of our markets, including $10 billion in our traditional independent model and $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. Multiple channels contributing to our growth better positions us to drive higher levels of recruiting over time. Looking at same-store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and expanding share of wallet with existing clients. A combination that drove same-store sales to new highs in the third quarter. At the same time, we further enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter and over the past year. In July, we on-boarded the advisors from Waddell & Reed and the final asset retention rate for the deal was approximately 99%. Currently, we are focused on the integration work to help these advisors optimally leverage our platform and support the growth of their businesses. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost, which is an increase of 23% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace. Our approach is to provide a platform that has the flexibility and personalization that make it simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice. We do this by providing advisors a breadth of the affiliation models, advisory platforms, investment content, technology, custody, and practice support that provides more flexibility in one place than anywhere else. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to an industry-leading advisor experience, continued solid organic growth, and increased market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in term. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. In our traditional markets, in the third quarter, we continue to increase our recruiting results, gain market share, and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite advisor movement remaining at lower levels. Looking at the large financial institutions marketplace, we on-boarded BMO Harris and M&T earlier this year and are applying the insights from those experiences to make our institutional offering even more robust and differentiated. This innovation and marketplace momentum are helping drive a solid pipeline with a growing number of prospects. As we look ahead, we are preparing to on-board CUNA Brokerage Services in the middle of next year and continue to see financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, the combination of a compelling value proposition and positive referrals from advisors using the new models are attracting more prospects and contributing to our growth. As a reminder, a year and a half ago, we launched Strategic Wealth Services and we have now added 17 practices, including eight in the past quarter. We subsequently brought our employee model to market later in the year and five practices have joined, including two over the past three months. Then earlier this year, we relaunched our RIA custody offering and have been encouraged by the number of RIAs, who quickly partnered with us. As we look ahead, we see these new affiliation models continuing to build momentum and becoming a larger contributor to our organic growth. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is the breadth and flexibility of our advisory platforms, from our turnkey centrally managed solutions to advisors managing portfolios themselves. This optionality is contributed to advisory now making up a majority of our total assets specifically within our centrally managed solutions with our ongoing investments in capabilities and pricing, our assets have increased to nearly $90 billion at an average annual organic growth rate of over 20% for the past five years. A key contributor to the growth of our centrally managed offerings is the increased personalization that enables advisors to use these solutions in the way that works best for them. For example, earlier this year, we introduced our Firm Sleeve solution, which together with Advisor Sleeve enables advisors and institutions to personalized centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models. We are now taking the next steps in this personalization journey by adding separately managed accounts while also integrating all centrally managed investment content into a single account for each client. These enhancements make it easier and more efficient for an advisor to expand the scope of their solutions while also providing a simpler and more unified experience which in turn contributes to the appeal and future growth of our centrally managed advisory solutions. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients and in turn, help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel Client Care Model. As a reminder, over the past year, we rolled out voice chat and digital help to our advisors giving them access to differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We are now focused on helping our advisors fully leveraged these channels to better serve their clients and more efficiently run their businesses. To further enhance our service model, we are also experimenting with specialized service pods designed specifically for different types of advisor practices. These pods include integrated teams comprised of service, case management, compliance, and relationship management. These experiments are helping us to tailor services based on advisors affiliation models and practice attributes and are making positive contributions to the advisor experience. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. Now, as we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our services portfolio. In the third quarter, our subscription base continued to grow more than doubling year over year to approximately 2600 subscriptions demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. We continue to innovate on our business solutions portfolio to expand the variety of needs we can solve for and provide a wider range of price points to enable a broader set of advisors to engage. One of our sources of innovation comes from advisor feedback on our existing solutions, which we use as a catalyst to iterate on our core offerings like CFO solutions. As an example, over the last year, this approach helped us identify several additional finance related needs for our advisors, which led to the development and launch of M&A solutions, Assurance Plan, and our book keeping pilot. Going forward, we will continue to leverage advisor feedback as fuel to expand our solutions portfolio. Now with the expansion and seasoning of our portfolio, the strategic value of business solutions also continues to expand and has become an important component of the value proposition and a contributor to growth and our new model such as Strategic Wealth Services. As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to innovate and expand the portfolio to increase the contribution to gross profit and organic growth. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients or driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remained focused on executing our strategy that help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Bill. So, let me take those on the, I think on the institutional front, which may have been your first question in terms of and how we think about that opportunity and see that and how we see the opportunity going forward. So look at the short answer is, we're excited about the opportunities across both the traditional bank outsourcing markets - that's your bank and credit even in the outsourcing market and then the new large institution market and just pursue those opportunities we continue to invest in our capabilities to make the model more appealing as a driver of growth across what is a collective $1 trillion market opportunity as you know. So again, I think we're well positioned to win the day and as we enhance our capabilities, we think that distinguishes our value proposition going forward. And we continue to be active and exploring those possibilities across that entire landscape. We see our pipeline continuing to grow and without giving you specific some, we have good confidence that we can continue to see this - this financial institution space as an ongoing sustainable and multi-year contributor to our organic growth. So that's, I think question number one. With your second question on with respect to our business solutions. So look, we have lots of opportunity here, right. This is a, this is a new offering where we continue to both take our core offering and expand it. So you think about starting with three to four professional services and how do you then broaden if you will, the reach across multiple different solutions inside the LPL advisor base. And so for there, I think that's predominantly where that 1200 subscriptions sit today. We do believe there is significant upside to continue to drive that penetration as we refine the value propositions of those offerings and we expand the number of solutions that we offer at different price points, you really significantly increase the available market within side that 20,000 advisors, and so we do believe that we're just in the logical normal early innings part of a 9-inning ballgame around the existing advisors on the LPL platform. So, I think that I hope that helps in terms of giving you that directional opportunity, I think when you explore outside the LPL platform, our priority is focused on the LPL platform today, so the only place we've experimented outside is with M&A solutions where I think it's very logical that you would, we would be interested in getting both potential buyers and sellers outside of the LPL platform to enrich our M&A solutions, our offering in the breadth of that marketplace. And so we continue to experiment there. We haven't done any deals outside of the LPL advisor family today, but we continue to explore that possibility. So, again we're just very early into exploring offering that type of solution outside the LPL advisor. I hope that helps. I'll take the first part of that. Matt, you take the second. So, Alex with respect to where the opportunity sets coming from I think your question set it up well, for the most part, it's new advisors coming onto our platform that will move from some other solution that they had been using wherever they came from. So that's obviously one driver of growth. A second driver of growth as we're seeing more and more advisors utilize essentially managed solutions versus Rep as PM or constructing their own portfolios for the efficiency gains for the opportunities of which to create some professional leverage points that allow them free, free up time to do other things, I think is a positive trade. So, the more we add capability to this and lower the cost, the more and more of, that's a logical trade for them. So that is the second component. And then I think the third is that you just continue to have this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory, which is obviously a tailwind across the entire advisory platform including centrally managed. So, you might, you might think about it through those three drivers. Yes, I think. Alex, just to add to that. Beyond that you would begin to factoring can we support and help their same-store sales growth, expand their utilization of advisory platforms et cetera. So those are, those are things that aren't necessarily contemplated that in the short run. Michael, just for purposes of a little bit of distinction are you talking about for the end client or for the advisor, or both? Yes, so for the advisor, we continue to see an income, an important part of the overall value proposition being the operating platform of which we provide them with that digital platform. So, anything that we can do that helps them operationally simplify what they do straight through processing, easy user interfaces that make for simple clicks to ultimately kick off a series of integrated workflows, those are great outcomes. And so that's where we think about this digital platform of which helping our advisors in terms of simplifying the overall day to day processing and drive efficiencies into their work. I think the second place that we think about is how do we add and enhance robotics AI into these overall systems to improve and enhance the efficacy of those systems. So, think about improving and enhancing our overall collaborative risk management with them would be another place. So you streamline, how you think about risk management, you have systems that are more efficient and effective at overall assessing some said risk and collaborating and working together with them is another opportunity and maybe a third one is, how do we help them with respect to prospective insights or trends that are occurring within their client base and how to position to better serve or support them or take a certain action. So, that might be three places in a wide spectrum of areas that we see is big opportunities on the, what I would call the advisor platform. And that's what we sometimes refer to as client works, as an operating platform or client works connected where we're actually streamlining workflows. With respect to the, to the end investor that's been a place of investment for us. That is not historically been a place that we - necessarily played into create great value and in the last four years, we've pivoted pretty significantly and are trying to create what I would call a digital platform that we wrap around the advisors, not meant to replace the advisors, actually meant to enhance the advisors value proposition to the client and enrich how they show up for that advisor. So, think about the combination of the advisors professional IP together with a really modernized digital experience around that and so we're investing in our digital capabilities in order to achieve that. So, anything from your standard ability to initiate and kick off workflows by the end investor to having robust content that provides them insights on industry opportunities within their portfolios to just the standard data they may need to better manage their account, when they want to, however they want to, sort of meeting them where they are. So, we see that is a really robust and ongoing place to invest as we think about transforming that over time into smarter, more intuitive AI driven opportunities to make sure we're there when client, we're there with the advisor when the client needs us most. Yes. In that case we were, as I had mentioned to you before, we were already a custodian if you will for RIAs. We just had done it in a more defensive posture and so we've been investing to streamline and improve the efficiency and experience that we can deliver as a custodian for someone, who is just focused on RIA business or advisory business. So, one that's been up. I would call it a year journey to improve that. We're still working on that, but we feel good about that journey in that trajectory. And then the second thing that we've done is we've added resources to focus on growing this business and hence the combination of those intersection point launching this last spring and we've had some what is what we expected was a trajectory very similar to our Swiss model or LPL employee model where you sort of build and ramped in and, and I would say that we were pleased that the quick response we and the interest that we've had in that custodial side that exceeded a bit of the ramp that we saw in those other models and so we still have some iteration and work to do as we learn to get feedback from those advisors that have joined us, but it's been a small handful today and the pipeline is interesting. And again we've got business development resources that are focused on going out and winning this business. So, I think you should think about it as we've seen the trajectory of those other two models. We do think it will follow a similar pattern. I'll buy it. We've got a faster start out of the gates. But, we think it will, it will follow a similar trajectory if you will, of growing into that. So it's very, very early on and we are establishing ourselves as a market player, a competitor, who has a viable competitive offering capability set that's competitively priced and now we've got to go out and sell it and pull those deals through. So, I think there's more to come on that. It's just really early and pleased that the quick response that we've had, we've onboarded several advisors and we've got a good solid pipeline building. Yes, I think, where I mean in the traditional markets or maybe the advisor movement. I don't actually mean to reflect those that are moving out of the warehouses, I actually a more reflecting the movement within the independent space and I do think that's more timing than anything. I think you had lots of folks that are already in the independent space with some of the success that they're having in the marketplace today and growing their practices and supporting their clients, as well as you just add to the complexity of coming out of a significant amount of change in the prior year due to the COVID environment. I think it's much more circumstantial than it is some structural shift in terms of the advisor movement in the independent space, but I do think that's probably reflective of the balance of this year and as we get to a place where we think, hopefully the COVID environment more normalizing, I think you'll see people ramped back up continuing to explore the strategic options versus just tactically managing their business. I hope that helps. Yes, sure. And so, as you say, outside of the current environment. Right. We do see that structural trend from moving from a - from let's call it a smaller provider to one that has more capabilities or higher quality capabilities that are going to help them better serve their clients, so that trend did exist today, even in this environment, and we do expect it to continue. Now as we are able to invest more robustly in new capabilities, new opportunities, new economics. I think that will only accelerate that trend, Devin. And then at some point when it hits one of those firms hard enough, then you will see as you say the capitulation point of trading the franchise and so we do expect that trend to continue. I think we, why we lead with organic growth and why we're so committed to investing in our capabilities to further enhance the appeal of the model, because we do see the independent space as a robust opportunity to continue to fuel our organic growth. Now the nice thing is, is you have the flexibility of the models that we offer now, right. We can take those investments and across these different models create a much bigger opportunity set from that growing appeal in this broadened available market and so much like we see that continued trend from the all captive to the independent model. We continue to expect that to accelerate and evolve and obviously we're playing or trying to in a significant way to be a participant in that. So, I think you've got it right. I think those structural trends continue and at some point on an individual sort of basis these companies will hit an inflection point where they feel like strategically, it makes more sense to explore some sort of transaction and certainly we're positioned to participate in that market at right valuations. So I hope that helps. Yes. that makes sense. And not to be overly precise, I would, as you say, look at it over a broader set of data than just one quarter. Naturally speaking, you've some, some elements of seasonality inside the third quarter because of the July, August timeframe or summer time frames, which sometimes reduces activity. And so, that said again without trying to make that the specific correlation here I kind of look at it more broadly over the last 12 months and you have seen some sustained elevated levels from where, from our jumping-off point in the prior 12 months. Right. And I think you've got a couple of things going on to think about summer are in market driven. You've got good solid equity performance in the market. You've got good liquidity in the market, which certainly drive some activity, coupled with I think ongoing rising interest rate environments will create more opportunities for certain brokerage solutions to be offered, think about things like annuities. So, those are some things to think about in the macro, I think when you think about our structural opportunities certainly the growing number of advisors we have will lead to more commission-based and sales-based business. And then on the sort of that same sort of structural concept that you've got the headwind of this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory and those are the sort of the drivers of the inputs that I would think about as you think about the opportunity set going forward. But look, I think the last couple of quarters, if you look at those across that entire sort of spectrum, you've got a logical sort of level of activity that I think reflects the current market environment. Hope that helps. Yes. Hey, thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we know it's a busy day for you. So, we really appreciate the time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks."

And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on their client's journey to achieve life's goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion up more than 45% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth or Waddell & Reed acquisition and equity market appreciation. Now with respect to organic growth, second quarter net new assets were $37 billion. This result to a 16% annualized growth rate driven by continued strength across new store sales, same store sales and retention, and brought our organic growth rate to over 12% for the past year. In the second quarter, recruited assets were 35 billion, which brought our total over the past year to $80 billion. Our continued growth in recur or in recruited assets, including new quarterly and full year highs reflects our ongoing progress on enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets during the quarter. Our recruiting results increased each in each of our markets with over $10 billion in our traditional independent model, over $22 billion and our institution services model and approximately $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. These broader and more diversified results help position us to drive higher levels of recruiting going forward. Now, now looking at the same store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remain proactive and focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and capturing more assets from existing clients, which drove same-store sales to new highs in the second quarter. At the same time, we further enhanced the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was over 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past year. Our second quarter of business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.85 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which is an increase of 30% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace. Our approach is to provide a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice through a breadth of affiliation models and the ability to personally configure the components of our offering to align with each advisor's unique needs and goals. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to continued solid organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors, where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets, where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our adjustable markets and our traditional markets, despite it visor movement in the overall industry remaining lower. In the second quarter, we continued to increase our recruiting results and gain market share the combination of our recruiting momentum and the appeal of our model continues to expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline. Looking at our financial institutions channel within the past two quarters, we on-boarded two new clients, BMO Harris and M&T. Then in June, we announced that CUNA brokerage services made the decision to partner with us and plans to join early next year. These results reflect the market opportunity that exists to leverage our capabilities, to serve large institutions. And as we look ahead, we continue to progress prospects through the pipeline and see large financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building across all three of our new affiliation models. Over the past quarter, we added five new practices across our strategic wealth services and employee models. And after re-launching the RIA only offering in April, we have been encouraged by the positive market reaction, including a new RIA that joined in May. Looking ahead, we see a growing pipeline across all of our new affiliation models. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a compliment to organic growth. After closing our Waddell & Reed Acquisition in April last week, we transitioned to our platform over 900 advisors, who serve approximately 98% of client assets. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is helping our advisors enrich how they serve their clients through the use of advisory platforms. In that spirit, we continue to innovate on our platform most recently with the introduction of a number of product pricing and capability enhancements. One new capability to highlight increases the personalization available within our centrally managed advisory solutions. Now, two years ago, we introduced adviser sleep, which allows advisors to personalize centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models while outsourcing the day-to-day work of portfolio allocation and trading to us. To build on this capability, last quarter, we launched from sleeve. This innovation enables larger firms, RIAs, and institutions to develop models that all advisors across their firms can use and thus providing additional ways to leverage our centrally managed platforms, to help me client needs differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency and advisor practices. At a over $9 billion of client assets is invested across advisor sleeve and firms sleeve and we will continue innovating to increase the value of these personalized investment offerings. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients. And in turn help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omni-channel client care model. And the second quarter we launched a digital help center, a machine learning based solution that gives advisors easy access to information that addresses their most common service related needs. This resource puts information that's personalized, timely and relevant at their fingertips, thus positioning advisors to serve their clients in a simpler and more efficient way. Together with our voice and chat channels, the digital help center enables advisors to access industry leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations through the enhancement of our digital operating model, including investing in new bots across our care organization. Now, this helps us to increase both our service levels and our capacity to grow as we can continue to scale our business. And we believe these investments in our client care model and the automation and streamline streamlining of our service operations are making positive contributions to the service experience while also increasing the scalability of our platform. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. As we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our product portfolio. In the second quarter, our subscription-based continued to scale to approximately 2100 monthly subscribers, more than double a year ago. This includes about 80 subscriptions with advisors who joined from Waddell &Reed. Now the more work on business solutions, the more we work on business solutions, the more opportunities we find to help our advisors solve additional challenges through the expansion of our product portfolio. We now have 7 solutions available in our product portfolio, three additional solutions in pilot and a handful of other offerings in the incubation phase. As we continue add new solutions, we expect to expand the adjustable market while at the same time, accelerating our pace of innovation, the foreclosing, I want to highlight our ongoing efforts to actively shape and refine our advisor centric culture, which is instrumental to executing our strategy. In the second quarter, we rolled out our adviser promise, which is a modern evolution of the advisor commitment creed our founders wrote more than 30 years ago. We will use this promise to drive further accountability for providing industry leading advisor experience and to continue to increase the competitive advantage, our advisor centric culture provides in the marketplace. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result drive long-term shareholder value with that. I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history. And in addition, we have now on-boarded three of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed, who collectively added over 100 billion of assets to our platform, helping drive our total assets to over $1.1 trillion. Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Starting with organic growth,total net new assets were $37 billion, which translates to a 16% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting same-store sales and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting and Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $35 billion, which brought our 12 month total to a new high of $80 billion. Moving on to our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2 advisory, net new assets for $21 billion. We're a 17% annualized growth rate with this growth. Our advisory assets are 52% of total assets. As we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.85 up 30% from a year ago, looking at our top-line growth gross profit reached a new high of $602 million up $22 million or 4% sequentially looking at the components commission advisory fees, net of payout. We're $197 million up $13 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and assets from Waddell & Reed in Q2. Our parent ratio was 86.3% up about 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout ratio will be approximately up approximately 100 basis points driven by the expected seasonal build and production bonus, as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed assets, which aren't a slightly lower payout on their platform. Moving on to asset based revenues sponsor revenues were $189 million in Q2 of $22 million sequentially.This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth. Waddell & Reed and equity market appreciation. Turning to the client cash revenues,they were $90 million down, $7 million from Q1 driven by lower ICA balances during the quarter. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $48 billion roughly flat with last quarter, looking more closely at our IC a yield. It was 98 basis points in Q2, relatively flat with Q1. As we look ahead to Q3 given where interest rates, quiet rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q3 ICU to be roughly flat to Q2. Now looking at our fixed rate portfolio, as a reminder, we have a fixed rate maturity at the end of the third quarter, which will lower our Q4 see a yield by approximately 10 basis points that said I would highlight that as the yield curve steepened earlier in Q2, we saw demand starts to return to the fixed rate suite market. As a result, we were able to enter into $600 million of new fixed rate contracts at the three-year point, which was about 40 basis points at the time, looking beyond Q3 and given the expectation that short-term interest rates will begin rising in late '20, '22 or early 2023.We thought it would be helpful to share the economic benefit of rising rates using the deposit betas we experienced in the most recent interest rates cycle.Using our current suite balances a 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate would translate to approximately $340 million of annual gross profit. Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues,they were $137 million down $4 million sequentially driven by trading volume that decreased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q3 prior to Waddell & Reed, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in-line with Q2. As we anticipate seasonally, lower transaction volumes and IRA fees will be offset by revenues from our national advisor conference. Turning to business solutions, we ended the quarter with approximately 2100 subscriptions, which is up 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $20 million of annual revenue. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core DNA. It was $252 million in Q2 and $240 million prior to what outreach looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 cords unit to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T but it's prior to expenses associated with what I would read moving on to two, two promotional expenses. They were $64 million up $10 million sequentially.Prior to Waddell & Reed costs,promotion was $57 million up $3 million sequentially, primarily driven by large financial institution onboarding and increased marketing expense. Turning to Q3, prior to Waddell & Reed, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by around $10 million. As we have two of our largest advisor conferences in Q3. I would also note that we have shifted several conferences that are typically in the first half of the year to the fourth quarter, this will likely lead to a similar level of promotional spending Q4. However, our plans could change depending on the environment. So we'll give you a more specific update next quarter. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed overall, the transaction is progressing even better than we expected across multiple fronts. As mentioned Waddell & Reed advisor serving approximately 98% of client assets have joined our platform, which is up from our prior estimate of 95% factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels. We now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $85 million up from $80 million. And we continue to expect to reach this run rate by the middle of next year. Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q2 with the leverage ratio at 2.3 times and corporate cash of $278 million as for capital deployment. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the first half of this year, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth and M&A. Looking ahead while we continue to see compelling opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth, we also feel well positioned to restart our share repurchase program. Initially focusing on repurchasing shares to offset dilution, which we estimate to be approximately $40 million per quarter, we will, of course remain flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth emerge. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results, including the best organic growth in our history. And just last week on board of the advisors, from Waddell & Reed, as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing, to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that operator,please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions].The first question comes from the line of Steven Chubakfrom Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Why did I start off with a question on just some of the ICA dynamics certainly encouraging to see the interest from bank partners for some longer dated money, but some of the ICA concerns to rest, but if rates remain at zero, the bank deposit mat demand remains tepid. You can just speak to the strategy for managing fixed term contracts over the next few years. And just generally, what are you hearing from your bank partners with regards to appetite to take on some additional fixed term contracts in the current environment?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, Steven, I I'll, I'll take that obviously. I think when you look at our, our fixed rate approach and strategy, it's really unchanged, right? Even the environment that you described, which is our goal remains getting to 50% to 75% of the portfolio fixed of course, in an environment where there is demand that that can help us do so. And I think when we're in an environment like we are now with rates low and the curve relatively flat, I think that's an environment where we would stay closer to that 50% point. And if you're in an environment where the absolute level of rates are higher and there's some steepness to that curve, I think we would naturally migrate to that 75% side of the, of that range. So that's been our approach for awhile. I think the, the environment we're in really doesn't change that. I think to your point on what we're hearing from our bank partners, I think it's, it's probably more what we're seeing and their actions, which is when there's some steepness to the curve and just looking at Q2 when it was the 10 year was at that 150 to 160 zone, right. There's economics on their side. And that's really when you saw them start to come back into the market and we were able to execute a relatively small amount, but I think from a really an indicator of their approach and intentions I think it spoke really, really loudly that once there some economics to be had that the fixed rate sweet market is something that I think would -- would return. So we're obviously not in that environment at this very moment, but I think it's a good idea as to what things could look like,if rates move up again.\nSteven Chubak: Actually I [Indiscernible] and just my follow-up maybe for Dan, you touched on this quite a bit in your prepared remarks in terms of the better balance across all the different affiliation options and the accelerating organic growth that you're seeing? I mean, one of the questions that we probably field most often from investors is this trying to unpack given some of the momentum that you're seeing, the new organic growth algorithm, especially given the momentum you're seeing within the institutional channel in particular, which seems to be adding at least 200 basis points plus of organic road? I didn't know, Dan, if you could just speak to given the progress you're seeing on the organic growth side, what do you think is like a new sustainable organic growth rate? if some of the success that you're seeing in non-traditional areas continues to build from here?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. That makes sense. And so perhaps it's as a way to.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks. That makes sense. Helps if I have the microphone on, sorry about that?\nDan Arnold: Yeah, for, for context, perhaps look, we're focused on organic growth and over the past three years, the team has done a great job of expanding that, think about that, that March from sort of 3% to over the last 12 months, 12%. Right. So if you break that down to get at your question, a bit two thirds of that has come from those traditional three oars in the water, if you talk about new store sales, same store sales and attrition. And if you peel that back a little further, that contribution from those oars is really well balanced across all three which I think, I think speaks to the durability of that growth, right. So that's two thirds of that, that journey from 3% to 12%. And then I think if you, if you look at the remaining third, that's come from our entry into supporting large financial institutions. And, and, and again, I think we're being very intentional about vesting in our capabilities that created an appealing solution for these large institutions as we've partnered with BMO and M&T we continue to invest in our capabilities for institutions, which we think just enrichens the, the appeal of the model. So we're quite optimistic about our pipeline there and our ability to continue to pull through pull through new institutions.And so we see that as a contributor to, to growth over the next several years or an ongoing contributor to growth that might be a way at least to think about the dynamics of how we got from three to 12 and perhaps how we think about going forward the durability around, have them look at the end of the day. Organic growth is a key point of our strategy, and we're focused on trying to drive that rate higher. And, and we've got three good avenues of which to continue to do that through our traditional markets, these expanded new markets and then this institution's marketplace. So I hope that gives you some color and helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open\nBill Katz: And a good evening, everyone. And thank you for taking the question just want to follow up on. So Steve's line of questioning there, just coming back at it a slightly different cut at the organic growth. Something that we're observing is combination of further penetration within each segment. As I sold, look at where you're picking up shift from, and also that mandate sizes seem to be rising. So could you speak a little bit to maybe why the seeing the, the better efficacy is this just idiosyncratic or is there something else, a Fort here as you saw the cumulative maybe time recruitment, what have you, is helping to bolster sort of that penetration?\nDan Arnold: Yeah, thanks for the question bill. And it's --it's a, it's a good one as you point out in terms of maybe the nuance that sits underneath it.So we look at it this way. We, we launched these three new models at different times, but we, we launched them from a, from a place of a hypothesis around a business model that we took to the marketplace. You get feedback, you'll learn as a part of that. You continue to invest in enrich your capabilities within that model. You successfully deliver it to clients. You begin to build a reputation with those clients around the success of that model and between new capabilities in the building reputation that, that supports momentum. That supports confidence in prospects exploring further this opportunity. And I think naturally leads to in many cases larger opportunities because of that building credibility. So I think that's how we think about the Swiss model and that's the most mature of the new models. We're seeing sort of a similar flight pattern. If you will, with a lens of growth, it's just 6, 7, 8 months behind the trajectory of Swiss and then RIA, we just, we just obviously relaunched in, in April. So hopefully that helps, but we do think it's that growing credibility with delivering a good solution that is serving clients well in the continued evolution of capabilities we'll create that natural lift on, on larger clients, bigger demand, growing pipelines and what we're trying to do is drive a much bigger contribution from those models.\nBill Katz: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe one from Matt, glad to see the buyback taking a little bit sooner, then maybe we modeling how'd you arrive at sort of the dilution offset. So I think about opportunity to grow organically opportunity for anything else on the M&A side of the equation. And then what, what, what are some of the other metrics we should be looking at to think about the potential me to upsize that buyback as we look ahead?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, though, I think the key thing is just our capital allocation framework. I think we're, we're continuing to deploy capital as you can see in the quarter in organic growth and M&A but at the same time, I think when you, when you go back six months ago, I think we're through some of the, the chunkier capital deployments on those first two categories. So I think we've got a little bit more excess capital to deploy. And when you run it through that framework, while we continue to have opportunities in those first two categories, I think we feel quite comfortable allocating capital to, to share our purchases, given both the capital level and the returns they generate. And I think as we look forward to your question, I think we'll continue to look at it from that same lens, with the principles of making sure we maintain a strong balance sheet is that's quite supportive of our organic growth. And if the opportunities to allocate to organic growth and M&A increase we'd move capital to there. And it's returning capital to shareholders is the primary place where it makes sense. We'd move capital to there. It's all about applying the framework. So that's how we'll continue to approach it going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just on the, with Dell transactions, help you can elaborate a little bit on the contribution in the quarter in terms of some of the puts and takes. I think there were also some one-time costs or some drag that was maybe partially offsetting some things there as well. So it'd be, you could elaborate a little bit on that and how we should be thinking about the timing of the ramp here particularly as we go into the second half of the year in terms of the contribution from Waddell?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, sure, sure. Michael, I think when you, we've got hopefully some good disclosures on that, that as I, as I talk here, you can look at, or maybe even look at later in our team metrics deck on slide 8 that I think helps with that. But I'll get a little bit, a little bit of color here. I think when you look in the second quarter, really the, the main action or activity was, was closing on the transaction and we're actually able to get some of that, that kind of first round of expense synergies a little bit earlier than we had expected a quarter ago. That's why you see that run rate hitting, $50 million from an annual basis. For the two months that we had, what on board in the quarter, as we look ahead to Q3 it's really about onboarding is the key integration activity, which, happened just last weekend. So that'll lead to some more gross profits synergies, also moving the advisers onto our payout grid, which is a little bit higher and then eliminating the cost of their custodian. Now, those things, coincidentally kind of net out, which is why you see Q3 still being at that same $50 million run rate, but, but a lot of activities happening. And then from this point forward meeting in Q4 through the middle of next year is really about the rest of the expense synergies and integration. And those are the activities that will bring us to that $85 million plus run rate by about the middle of next year. So, so that's the path on the, on the integration and run rate side your question on the kind of one timers, I think the acquisition costs which we now estimate, or a total will be a total of around a hundred million that shows up in that acquisition cost line item, which you saw that really increase in the second quarter from the closing. And then I'd highlight the third quarter is probably going to be the, the quarter with the largest amount of that a hundred million. Our estimate right now is in the $40 to $50 million range and that's really tied to the onboarding activities, which are, which is the activity that naturally encouraged the most costs. So hope that helps\nMichael Cyprys: Super, thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the ICA balances. We saw the overflow balances decline a bit in the quarter. Just curious what appetite or ability is there to sort of expand the the variable balances and really take those overflows down to zero. What's the potential to do that? Would you say?\nMatt Audette: Well, I think that gets back to just when there's demand from the banks, right. I talked a little bit earlier about, when the, on the fixed rate side, when, when rates move up along the curve, meaning that, that three to five-year point, there's some demand there on the floating rate side, I think it's really going to come back to the, the amount of liquidity that's in the market in banks needing liquidity for their balance sheets. And I think we're, where we sit today, there's still just a, a substantial amount of liquidity in the market, but I think we're now in the second quarter, in a row where you're starting to see some signs of activity that ultimately would lead to that demand returning right. Consumer spending, picking up, right,that's coming out of checking's and savings accounts at the banks. Loan balance is beginning to grow, meaning they're loaning out that cash.So I think if you continue to see the trends there, I think those are the things that would ultimately lead to that demand picking up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. So maybe a two part question, I think you've changed some of the rate sensitivities in your deck on the gross profit benefit from, from rate hikes. And you noted that the beta was two and a half percent through your first four hikes in the last cycle. So yes, the first question is, should we take the sensitivity to mean you expect similar beta dynamics during the next psyching cycle? And the second part of that question is it's really like if you look back during the last rate hiking cycle, you took advantage of the gross profit benefit to really increase technology spending and reinvest in the platform? However, you're, you're in a different spot today in terms of ongoing reinvestment into the platform. So as we look ahead towards the next rate hiking cycle and as you kind of outlined very meaningful, gross profit -- profit benefits, how should we think about how much of that could fall to the bottom line versus wanting to take advantage of the environment to, to reinvest in the business and increased spending?\nMatt Audette: Yeah,Yeah, I think on the, on the sensitivities, and I think that the, what we were trying to do there is really, give some empirical data on from the last interest rate cycle right now, market demand and market pricing ultimately drives where deposit betas go. But I think from our chair that the best information to look at to get an expectation of what, what happened is what happened most recently. And I think that's what we updated our our metrics to show, which was an average beta 15%, that period of 2015 to 2019, but then the early part of the cycle, it was two and a half and then later part of the cycle '25. So I think the, the, the market dynamics will determine where that goes. But I think looking at the history from our chair, it's probably the best thing to look at. Now to your point on what to do with that revenue, I think it will go back to our capital allocation framework, right. The same thing that we're applying today on where the, the highest and best returns are and when you look at investing in the platform, those are things that drive organic growth and if there's things that can drive a return there, we focus there. And then to M&A then returning capital to shareholders, which from a gross profit standpoint, can, can show up in the form of, of just incremental margin and delivering, operating leverage. So it'll just be based on our opportunity set at that time. And I just emphasize, I think when we, when we take a step back and even just building on what Dan was talking about earlier in our opportunities and the different channels and models we have, I think we're excited about an environment where we can continue to grow further.\nOperator: This question comes from the line of Alex Blosteinfrom Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: You on-boarded in the second quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the financial advisors appetite to enhance capabilities that LPL can offer resonates most? And then maybe just put some, putting some numbers around that gross profit on that a hundred billion dollars of assets kind of where's that now. And what do you think that could ultimately go?\nDan Arnold: Let me take the first half of that, Matt, and you take the second. So yeah, Alex with respect to the advisors look, the, the typical principles that, that one large institution might, might choose or use to, to make the selection to partner with us typically has to do with enhanced technology capabilities. So can we provide them technology, automated workflows, et cetera, to drive efficiency into their practices, free up time for them in their teams to spend on clients and prospects and so that is a priority and we spend a good bit of time making sure that you do the appropriate level of training, coaching, and, and, and, and work to ensure that they can leverage that, that sort of comprehensive technology offering. And that takes time. They don't get that on day one, but you continue to work on it and they become proficient at it quickly. And that becomes a big leverage point. So that is one area that they tend to look at. A second one would be the advisory platform that we have and the breadth of options and alternatives. We give them from a capability set from an investment content from a pricing standpoint, from a vertical integration and ease of doing business that that certainly is a, is a way for them to, to provide expanded or enhanced value of advice to their, to their end clients ultimately help them differentiate and support their growth aspirations. And so there you get a great client experience at the end of the day, matched with also some tailwinds for growth. And so that would be a second area that I would tend to highlight. And if you look at the institutions at a macro level, right our ability to partner in and provide a good deal of support and advice through -- through the compliance and risk management support that we can provide shifts the risk profile for them with this business initiative. And I think creates at an institutional level unimportant element of value. A second one is just improved and enhanced economics typically shifting from a, a model where you've got the entire cost structure and then have to make the investment labor and technology, et cetera, to do it. And you can go to a more outsourced arrangement. We typically see an improvement and enhancement and overall economic, so I'll stop there, but those were maybe some high level things that are in it for the, for the advisors and their clients, as well as the institution as a whole.\nMatt Audette: And then, and then now it's just on the, on the gross profit or the return side, when you look at the financial institutions channel, right, they're typically much larger to the point of the first part of your question, a little bit heavily focused on the brokerage side. So you get RIAthat are that as a starting point or closer where brokerage RIAare. So think 15 basis points a little bit of additional color on CUNA there a network of credit unions. So we, we share some of that gross profit with them. So for that particular opportunity to be more than the 10 to 15 basis points zone. And then on the cost side, I think that the, the cost to serve is lower just given, given that size. And then the, the TA and the underwriting factors in all those economics, you bring it down to the bottom line. And you look at our, if you look at our EBITDA operating margins, they're quite creative to that with, with one caveat that, that deals of this size in the, in the nature of this channel, usually come with some, incentives in the early terms of the deal, first year and second year. So those economics grow over time as you, as you get deeper into the contract. So hope that helps.\nAlex Blostein: That helps. Thanks. and just maybe a quick clarification around the ICA dynamics. So clearly LPL continues to have significant amount of upside higher interest rates and appreciate you guys highlighted below the positive bit as well, but that's obviously very helpful from the last cycle. How do you think about the trade-off I guess here between fixing out kind of at 40 bips for three years if the demand picks up again, sort of versus waiting for a particular, potentially a much more material upside, 12 to 18 months out?\nMatt Audette: Yeah, I think it goes back to that 50% to 75% approach. Alex. I think we're really focused on on having a stable earning stream in this area and not trying to be folks that pick the points where interest rates make sense and don't make sense. I think we've got a principle is we'll hedge a little bit lower on the percent. If the, if the economics look like they're at the lower point and a little bit higher on the, on the percentage, if we look like they're at a higher point, but once you get below that, we're not trying to tactically pick those points, I think, specific to this quarter. I think when you're in the market that I think we're all collectively in when a bank comes up and has demand for sweep deposits I think most people would -- would say yes and, and deploy that. And that's what we did on that particular opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was I was hoping maybe we could get a little extra color on the on the business solutions. It sounds like Dan may, may have mentioned three in pilot, a handful of others that are perhaps on the com. I don't know if it's too early, but would, would certainly love to hear a little bit about, about those. And then also, what has been really resonating? I think it sounded like 80 or so if my notes are right that have already been kind of picked up from some of the widow advisors. So any, anything additional, there would be a, I think of of use. Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Maybe I'll give you just a quick snapshot of the product portfolio. And then and then I can answer your question about maybe some of the early interests from the Waddell & Reed folks, and, and then happy to share the three that we've got in pilot phase. And so if you look at the, the, the solutions today, as I mentioned, there's seven there's the original three, which were admin solution, CFO and marketing. With respect to Waddell & Reed, the most popular one for them thus far has been admin solutions, which makes sense if you're thinking about coming in and learning a new environment and making the transition. So and you've got people in the LPL ecosystem that are experienced in supporting and helping do that. I think that's a, that's a, that's a logical place to look for a leverage point. And if you didn't have access to that admin at the, the market rates of hiring someone directly, this is, this is actually a new service and a good alternative, lower cost way to do that. With respect to the solutions then that we've added to that original portfolio, you've got the assurance plan which is we just rolled out the resilience plan and those two are ways of which to support and help advisors plan for unexpected and or expected transitions from the business. So assurance plan was the old plan that if unfortunately it kind of gave someone downside protection if something happened to them unexpectedly and the, in the business had to be transitioned. This gives them an orderly way to, to make that transition to do that resilience plan was added as a, as an ideation from that in a learning and a feedback that advisors really liked the assurance plan, but they also said, well, what if we have a short term disruption in our ability to operate or run the business, could you help us with that as well? And so that's where we came up with this idea with the resilience plan that gives them some support and a backstop, if they had an unexpected problem, think about disability or something like that, or if they even have a planned need to have an extended leave from the business such as a fraternity or maternity type of leaves. And so pretty cool innovation that came from the feedback and the appeal of the insurance plan. There's also M&A solutions that we've launched earlier in the year and remote office solutions that emerged during the pandemic, the three they're in pilot real quickly, you've got a bookkeeping solution that we're experimenting with that was born out of the, the CFO solution. And I continued innovation from the feedback that our clients give us on their needs. There's a paraplanning solution in pilot. And then finally something we call it client engage, which is meant to be a way to support and help the advisors managing successfully the servicing communications with their clients. I'll pause there, but that's, that's that gives you a quick snapshot of the portfolio.\nGerry O'Hara: Helpful. Appreciate and appreciate that. And then maybe just one for Matt, if you might have a comment or two just on the environment around, around transition assistance, what, you're, what you're saying, what you're hearing? I think we'd all appreciate that as well. Thank you. \nMatt Audette: Yeah, sure. I think that the headline is we're, we're seeing a pretty consistent environment, which is the, the overall value prop at the firm is what matters the most. And I think when you get then click down into transition assistance, to help facilitate the move from one firm to another I think we're seeing pretty similar levels that we've seen in the last few quarters. So, so no change on that, on our end. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good evening guys.S tart here with just a bigger picture question. As we watch the business scale and increase, affiliation options with a lot of success, bringing in larger advisors that have, more complex businesses does the thinking evolve at all around potentially re-exploring the merits of becoming a bank and I appreciate it's complicated. And, and obviously you guys decided to not two years ago, but just given those dynamics of how the business is evolving, maybe coupled with some of the near term dynamics around rates. I'm just curious if it kind of comes back on or the pendulum swings in one direction there?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. Maybe we both can give some color on that. I'll start Matt, you feel free to provide any insights. So obviously from a strategic standpoint, we, we have a significant set of considerations that you always think about and you're diligent around always evolving your assessment, given changes in the marketplace, changes in the business changes in the competitive landscape. And so potentially being a bank is one of those things that we would always keep active sort of that assessment in that consideration. And I think we would look at it from a strategic standpoint, are there capabilities that, that -- that could potentially support advisors and their value to clients. And is it a better way to manage ultimately, our, our cash balances and, or ultimately deploy and execute against some of that expanded capability that I was mentioned earlier. And so I think we always look at it from the standpoint of what's the best way to do that, right The old do, do we do it ourselves or do we outsource it The marketplace has given us lots of options of which to find different ways to provide capabilities and, and to effectively manage our cash balances using someone else's balance sheet to do that. And we think that strategically makes sense in the short run, as long as we find the options and alternatives to do that, and we can deliver the capabilities that our clients need. And that's kind of how we see it in the short run, but I think we continually look at the different market dynamics and keep that assessment alive, just so it's fresh, we're clear and have the most informed view that we can about our set of options.I'll pause there. You want to add anything to that? \nMatt Audette: That is all said. I just emphasize a couple of things that the key Devin is, is making sure that we're in a position to deliver the products and capabilities that matter to our advisors and their clients. And do you need a bank charter to do that? And I think to Dan's point, the marketplace has given us plenty of options where you don't. And I think the second part of the question is, well, what, what's the best return on capital, right? Deposits on our balance sheet versus someone else's. And I think you run that math, especially in an environment like this and the return on capital of having a bank is not a pretty picture. So I think it makes sense where we are now, but to Dan's point, I think we always look to make sure if the world changes that, we'd be aware of that.\nDevin Ryan: I appreciate the update there. And then the follow-up, I guess shorter term or a smaller topic you guys talked about streamlining, automating, the service offering, which is interesting. And as we think about just the, the bigger opportunity to automate the platform and, and, utilize technology to, to, to kind of scale the business from here, how should we think about like the expense buckets and maybe where there's incremental operating leverage in the model like, so service feels like that that's one example where, there's a number of people doing jobs where in some cases new technology may be able to step in and disintermediate some of that and save some money for LPL. I guess if there's any way to frame that and are there any other areas like that that could be kind of margin enhancing?\nDan Arnold: Yeah, that's a good, it's a great question. And it's one from an, an operational execution standpoint, I think we're, we're keen on exploring what are those sort of world of possibilities and how we might best do that. So if I just gave you a little color on areas that we think about, there's certainly leveraging robotics, as you say, for more repetitive type of work where as you expand and you grow and you can transform that work into, to a more automated type of solution makes tons of sense in the short run from potential expense synergies. But adds a lot from a scalability standpoint,so across our operations and our compliance organizations you see opportunities for robotics. You also have opportunities to use AI for quicker assessments and more robust, broader spectrum assessments. So think about the efficacy of oversight of our own compliance controls or risk management controls. And that's a place where you could use AI to step in as a, as a real leverage point for for the work that, that our folks do. And in that case, that may not eliminate jobs, but that may create lots of scalability as you go forward because of the more efficient, effective use of automation to assess greater and greater volumes of, of, of business. So that would be another example, I think, where you could use newer technology with you, if you will, our automation and deploy it within the organization. Maybe I'll pause there. And I don't know if you want to take on the implications or contribution that may occur from that.\nMatt Audette: Yeah. I just emphasize with Dan said, I think the biggest opportunities are really investing in and deploying technology that allows us to scale, right?So for, every, every dollar of assets we're adding, we're adding less expense than we had to add for the prior asset, right. That somatically that's the primary approach. I think when you look at what that could deliver, I think it gets back to our principles of the amount that we would invest. We're going to be focused on both investing to support that growth, but at the same time, delivering, operating leverage. Right. And I think that you see us doing that, I think right now. \nDan Arnold: And I think that same approach as allude have going forward. Yeah. I'd leave you with this. Think about it as dry using automation and technology and modern technology to drive the future advisor and end client experience the efficacy of your risk management oversight, and finally third scalability in the overall operations.\nOperator: And there are no other questions over the phone line at this time. I would like to turn the call over back to Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks, sir.\nDan Arnold: Thanks much RJ. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. And we look forward to speaking with you again. Next quarter, have a great day\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history. And in addition, we have now on-boarded three of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed, who collectively added over 100 billion of assets to our platform, helping drive our total assets to over $1.1 trillion. Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Starting with organic growth,total net new assets were $37 billion, which translates to a 16% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting same-store sales and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting and Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $35 billion, which brought our 12 month total to a new high of $80 billion. Moving on to our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2 advisory, net new assets for $21 billion. We're a 17% annualized growth rate with this growth. Our advisory assets are 52% of total assets. As we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.85 up 30% from a year ago, looking at our top-line growth gross profit reached a new high of $602 million up $22 million or 4% sequentially looking at the components commission advisory fees, net of payout. We're $197 million up $13 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and assets from Waddell & Reed in Q2. Our parent ratio was 86.3% up about 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout ratio will be approximately up approximately 100 basis points driven by the expected seasonal build and production bonus, as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed assets, which aren't a slightly lower payout on their platform. Moving on to asset based revenues sponsor revenues were $189 million in Q2 of $22 million sequentially.This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth. Waddell & Reed and equity market appreciation. Turning to the client cash revenues,they were $90 million down, $7 million from Q1 driven by lower ICA balances during the quarter. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $48 billion roughly flat with last quarter, looking more closely at our IC a yield. It was 98 basis points in Q2, relatively flat with Q1. As we look ahead to Q3 given where interest rates, quiet rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q3 ICU to be roughly flat to Q2. Now looking at our fixed rate portfolio, as a reminder, we have a fixed rate maturity at the end of the third quarter, which will lower our Q4 see a yield by approximately 10 basis points that said I would highlight that as the yield curve steepened earlier in Q2, we saw demand starts to return to the fixed rate suite market. As a result, we were able to enter into $600 million of new fixed rate contracts at the three-year point, which was about 40 basis points at the time, looking beyond Q3 and given the expectation that short-term interest rates will begin rising in late '20, '22 or early 2023.We thought it would be helpful to share the economic benefit of rising rates using the deposit betas we experienced in the most recent interest rates cycle.Using our current suite balances a 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate would translate to approximately $340 million of annual gross profit. Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues,they were $137 million down $4 million sequentially driven by trading volume that decreased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q3 prior to Waddell & Reed, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in-line with Q2. As we anticipate seasonally, lower transaction volumes and IRA fees will be offset by revenues from our national advisor conference. Turning to business solutions, we ended the quarter with approximately 2100 subscriptions, which is up 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $20 million of annual revenue. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core DNA. It was $252 million in Q2 and $240 million prior to what outreach looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 cords unit to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T but it's prior to expenses associated with what I would read moving on to two, two promotional expenses. They were $64 million up $10 million sequentially.Prior to Waddell & Reed costs,promotion was $57 million up $3 million sequentially, primarily driven by large financial institution onboarding and increased marketing expense. Turning to Q3, prior to Waddell & Reed, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by around $10 million. As we have two of our largest advisor conferences in Q3. I would also note that we have shifted several conferences that are typically in the first half of the year to the fourth quarter, this will likely lead to a similar level of promotional spending Q4. However, our plans could change depending on the environment. So we'll give you a more specific update next quarter. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed overall, the transaction is progressing even better than we expected across multiple fronts. As mentioned Waddell & Reed advisor serving approximately 98% of client assets have joined our platform, which is up from our prior estimate of 95% factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels. We now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $85 million up from $80 million. And we continue to expect to reach this run rate by the middle of next year. Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q2 with the leverage ratio at 2.3 times and corporate cash of $278 million as for capital deployment. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the first half of this year, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth and M&A. Looking ahead while we continue to see compelling opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth, we also feel well positioned to restart our share repurchase program. Initially focusing on repurchasing shares to offset dilution, which we estimate to be approximately $40 million per quarter, we will, of course remain flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth emerge. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results, including the best organic growth in our history. And just last week on board of the advisors, from Waddell & Reed, as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing, to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that operator,please open the call for questions. Yeah, Steven, I I'll, I'll take that obviously. I think when you look at our, our fixed rate approach and strategy, it's really unchanged, right? Even the environment that you described, which is our goal remains getting to 50% to 75% of the portfolio fixed of course, in an environment where there is demand that that can help us do so. And I think when we're in an environment like we are now with rates low and the curve relatively flat, I think that's an environment where we would stay closer to that 50% point. And if you're in an environment where the absolute level of rates are higher and there's some steepness to that curve, I think we would naturally migrate to that 75% side of the, of that range. So that's been our approach for awhile. I think the, the environment we're in really doesn't change that. I think to your point on what we're hearing from our bank partners, I think it's, it's probably more what we're seeing and their actions, which is when there's some steepness to the curve and just looking at Q2 when it was the 10 year was at that 150 to 160 zone, right. There's economics on their side. And that's really when you saw them start to come back into the market and we were able to execute a relatively small amount, but I think from a really an indicator of their approach and intentions I think it spoke really, really loudly that once there some economics to be had that the fixed rate sweet market is something that I think would -- would return. So we're obviously not in that environment at this very moment, but I think it's a good idea as to what things could look like,if rates move up again. Yeah, though, I think the key thing is just our capital allocation framework. I think we're, we're continuing to deploy capital as you can see in the quarter in organic growth and M&A but at the same time, I think when you, when you go back six months ago, I think we're through some of the, the chunkier capital deployments on those first two categories. So I think we've got a little bit more excess capital to deploy. And when you run it through that framework, while we continue to have opportunities in those first two categories, I think we feel quite comfortable allocating capital to, to share our purchases, given both the capital level and the returns they generate. And I think as we look forward to your question, I think we'll continue to look at it from that same lens, with the principles of making sure we maintain a strong balance sheet is that's quite supportive of our organic growth. And if the opportunities to allocate to organic growth and M&A increase we'd move capital to there. And it's returning capital to shareholders is the primary place where it makes sense. We'd move capital to there. It's all about applying the framework. So that's how we'll continue to approach it going forward. Yeah, sure, sure. Michael, I think when you, we've got hopefully some good disclosures on that, that as I, as I talk here, you can look at, or maybe even look at later in our team metrics deck on slide 8 that I think helps with that. But I'll get a little bit, a little bit of color here. I think when you look in the second quarter, really the, the main action or activity was, was closing on the transaction and we're actually able to get some of that, that kind of first round of expense synergies a little bit earlier than we had expected a quarter ago. That's why you see that run rate hitting, $50 million from an annual basis. For the two months that we had, what on board in the quarter, as we look ahead to Q3 it's really about onboarding is the key integration activity, which, happened just last weekend. So that'll lead to some more gross profits synergies, also moving the advisers onto our payout grid, which is a little bit higher and then eliminating the cost of their custodian. Now, those things, coincidentally kind of net out, which is why you see Q3 still being at that same $50 million run rate, but, but a lot of activities happening. And then from this point forward meeting in Q4 through the middle of next year is really about the rest of the expense synergies and integration. And those are the activities that will bring us to that $85 million plus run rate by about the middle of next year. So, so that's the path on the, on the integration and run rate side your question on the kind of one timers, I think the acquisition costs which we now estimate, or a total will be a total of around a hundred million that shows up in that acquisition cost line item, which you saw that really increase in the second quarter from the closing. And then I'd highlight the third quarter is probably going to be the, the quarter with the largest amount of that a hundred million. Our estimate right now is in the $40 to $50 million range and that's really tied to the onboarding activities, which are, which is the activity that naturally encouraged the most costs. So hope that helps Well, I think that gets back to just when there's demand from the banks, right. I talked a little bit earlier about, when the, on the fixed rate side, when, when rates move up along the curve, meaning that, that three to five-year point, there's some demand there on the floating rate side, I think it's really going to come back to the, the amount of liquidity that's in the market in banks needing liquidity for their balance sheets. And I think we're, where we sit today, there's still just a, a substantial amount of liquidity in the market, but I think we're now in the second quarter, in a row where you're starting to see some signs of activity that ultimately would lead to that demand returning right. Consumer spending, picking up, right,that's coming out of checking's and savings accounts at the banks. Loan balance is beginning to grow, meaning they're loaning out that cash.So I think if you continue to see the trends there, I think those are the things that would ultimately lead to that demand picking up. Yeah,Yeah, I think on the, on the sensitivities, and I think that the, what we were trying to do there is really, give some empirical data on from the last interest rate cycle right now, market demand and market pricing ultimately drives where deposit betas go. But I think from our chair that the best information to look at to get an expectation of what, what happened is what happened most recently. And I think that's what we updated our our metrics to show, which was an average beta 15%, that period of 2015 to 2019, but then the early part of the cycle, it was two and a half and then later part of the cycle '25. So I think the, the, the market dynamics will determine where that goes. But I think looking at the history from our chair, it's probably the best thing to look at. Now to your point on what to do with that revenue, I think it will go back to our capital allocation framework, right. The same thing that we're applying today on where the, the highest and best returns are and when you look at investing in the platform, those are things that drive organic growth and if there's things that can drive a return there, we focus there. And then to M&A then returning capital to shareholders, which from a gross profit standpoint, can, can show up in the form of, of just incremental margin and delivering, operating leverage. So it'll just be based on our opportunity set at that time. And I just emphasize, I think when we, when we take a step back and even just building on what Dan was talking about earlier in our opportunities and the different channels and models we have, I think we're excited about an environment where we can continue to grow further. And then, and then now it's just on the, on the gross profit or the return side, when you look at the financial institutions channel, right, they're typically much larger to the point of the first part of your question, a little bit heavily focused on the brokerage side. So you get RIAthat are that as a starting point or closer where brokerage RIAare. So think 15 basis points a little bit of additional color on CUNA there a network of credit unions. So we, we share some of that gross profit with them. So for that particular opportunity to be more than the 10 to 15 basis points zone. And then on the cost side, I think that the, the cost to serve is lower just given, given that size. And then the, the TA and the underwriting factors in all those economics, you bring it down to the bottom line. And you look at our, if you look at our EBITDA operating margins, they're quite creative to that with, with one caveat that, that deals of this size in the, in the nature of this channel, usually come with some, incentives in the early terms of the deal, first year and second year. So those economics grow over time as you, as you get deeper into the contract. So hope that helps. Yeah, I think it goes back to that 50% to 75% approach. Alex. I think we're really focused on on having a stable earning stream in this area and not trying to be folks that pick the points where interest rates make sense and don't make sense. I think we've got a principle is we'll hedge a little bit lower on the percent. If the, if the economics look like they're at the lower point and a little bit higher on the, on the percentage, if we look like they're at a higher point, but once you get below that, we're not trying to tactically pick those points, I think, specific to this quarter. I think when you're in the market that I think we're all collectively in when a bank comes up and has demand for sweep deposits I think most people would -- would say yes and, and deploy that. And that's what we did on that particular opportunity. Yeah, sure. I think that the headline is we're, we're seeing a pretty consistent environment, which is the, the overall value prop at the firm is what matters the most. And I think when you get then click down into transition assistance, to help facilitate the move from one firm to another I think we're seeing pretty similar levels that we've seen in the last few quarters. So, so no change on that, on our end. That is all said. I just emphasize a couple of things that the key Devin is, is making sure that we're in a position to deliver the products and capabilities that matter to our advisors and their clients. And do you need a bank charter to do that? And I think to Dan's point, the marketplace has given us plenty of options where you don't. And I think the second part of the question is, well, what, what's the best return on capital, right? Deposits on our balance sheet versus someone else's. And I think you run that math, especially in an environment like this and the return on capital of having a bank is not a pretty picture. So I think it makes sense where we are now, but to Dan's point, I think we always look to make sure if the world changes that, we'd be aware of that. Yeah. I just emphasize with Dan said, I think the biggest opportunities are really investing in and deploying technology that allows us to scale, right?So for, every, every dollar of assets we're adding, we're adding less expense than we had to add for the prior asset, right. That somatically that's the primary approach. I think when you look at what that could deliver, I think it gets back to our principles of the amount that we would invest. We're going to be focused on both investing to support that growth, but at the same time, delivering, operating leverage. Right. And I think that you see us doing that, I think right now."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, RJ. And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on their client's journey to achieve life's goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion up more than 45% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth or Waddell & Reed acquisition and equity market appreciation. Now with respect to organic growth, second quarter net new assets were $37 billion. This result to a 16% annualized growth rate driven by continued strength across new store sales, same store sales and retention, and brought our organic growth rate to over 12% for the past year. In the second quarter, recruited assets were 35 billion, which brought our total over the past year to $80 billion. Our continued growth in recur or in recruited assets, including new quarterly and full year highs reflects our ongoing progress on enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets during the quarter. Our recruiting results increased each in each of our markets with over $10 billion in our traditional independent model, over $22 billion and our institution services model and approximately $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. These broader and more diversified results help position us to drive higher levels of recruiting going forward. Now, now looking at the same store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remain proactive and focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and capturing more assets from existing clients, which drove same-store sales to new highs in the second quarter. At the same time, we further enhanced the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was over 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past year. Our second quarter of business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.85 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which is an increase of 30% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace. Our approach is to provide a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice through a breadth of affiliation models and the ability to personally configure the components of our offering to align with each advisor's unique needs and goals. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to continued solid organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors, where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets, where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our adjustable markets and our traditional markets, despite it visor movement in the overall industry remaining lower. In the second quarter, we continued to increase our recruiting results and gain market share the combination of our recruiting momentum and the appeal of our model continues to expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline. Looking at our financial institutions channel within the past two quarters, we on-boarded two new clients, BMO Harris and M&T. Then in June, we announced that CUNA brokerage services made the decision to partner with us and plans to join early next year. These results reflect the market opportunity that exists to leverage our capabilities, to serve large institutions. And as we look ahead, we continue to progress prospects through the pipeline and see large financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building across all three of our new affiliation models. Over the past quarter, we added five new practices across our strategic wealth services and employee models. And after re-launching the RIA only offering in April, we have been encouraged by the positive market reaction, including a new RIA that joined in May. Looking ahead, we see a growing pipeline across all of our new affiliation models. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a compliment to organic growth. After closing our Waddell & Reed Acquisition in April last week, we transitioned to our platform over 900 advisors, who serve approximately 98% of client assets. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is helping our advisors enrich how they serve their clients through the use of advisory platforms. In that spirit, we continue to innovate on our platform most recently with the introduction of a number of product pricing and capability enhancements. One new capability to highlight increases the personalization available within our centrally managed advisory solutions. Now, two years ago, we introduced adviser sleep, which allows advisors to personalize centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models while outsourcing the day-to-day work of portfolio allocation and trading to us. To build on this capability, last quarter, we launched from sleeve. This innovation enables larger firms, RIAs, and institutions to develop models that all advisors across their firms can use and thus providing additional ways to leverage our centrally managed platforms, to help me client needs differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency and advisor practices. At a over $9 billion of client assets is invested across advisor sleeve and firms sleeve and we will continue innovating to increase the value of these personalized investment offerings. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients. And in turn help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omni-channel client care model. And the second quarter we launched a digital help center, a machine learning based solution that gives advisors easy access to information that addresses their most common service related needs. This resource puts information that's personalized, timely and relevant at their fingertips, thus positioning advisors to serve their clients in a simpler and more efficient way. Together with our voice and chat channels, the digital help center enables advisors to access industry leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations through the enhancement of our digital operating model, including investing in new bots across our care organization. Now, this helps us to increase both our service levels and our capacity to grow as we can continue to scale our business. And we believe these investments in our client care model and the automation and streamline streamlining of our service operations are making positive contributions to the service experience while also increasing the scalability of our platform. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. As we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our product portfolio. In the second quarter, our subscription-based continued to scale to approximately 2100 monthly subscribers, more than double a year ago. This includes about 80 subscriptions with advisors who joined from Waddell &Reed. Now the more work on business solutions, the more we work on business solutions, the more opportunities we find to help our advisors solve additional challenges through the expansion of our product portfolio. We now have 7 solutions available in our product portfolio, three additional solutions in pilot and a handful of other offerings in the incubation phase. As we continue add new solutions, we expect to expand the adjustable market while at the same time, accelerating our pace of innovation, the foreclosing, I want to highlight our ongoing efforts to actively shape and refine our advisor centric culture, which is instrumental to executing our strategy. In the second quarter, we rolled out our adviser promise, which is a modern evolution of the advisor commitment creed our founders wrote more than 30 years ago. We will use this promise to drive further accountability for providing industry leading advisor experience and to continue to increase the competitive advantage, our advisor centric culture provides in the marketplace. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result drive long-term shareholder value with that. I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yeah. That makes sense. And so perhaps it's as a way to. Yeah, for, for context, perhaps look, we're focused on organic growth and over the past three years, the team has done a great job of expanding that, think about that, that March from sort of 3% to over the last 12 months, 12%. Right. So if you break that down to get at your question, a bit two thirds of that has come from those traditional three oars in the water, if you talk about new store sales, same store sales and attrition. And if you peel that back a little further, that contribution from those oars is really well balanced across all three which I think, I think speaks to the durability of that growth, right. So that's two thirds of that, that journey from 3% to 12%. And then I think if you, if you look at the remaining third, that's come from our entry into supporting large financial institutions. And, and, and again, I think we're being very intentional about vesting in our capabilities that created an appealing solution for these large institutions as we've partnered with BMO and M&T we continue to invest in our capabilities for institutions, which we think just enrichens the, the appeal of the model. So we're quite optimistic about our pipeline there and our ability to continue to pull through pull through new institutions.And so we see that as a contributor to, to growth over the next several years or an ongoing contributor to growth that might be a way at least to think about the dynamics of how we got from three to 12 and perhaps how we think about going forward the durability around, have them look at the end of the day. Organic growth is a key point of our strategy, and we're focused on trying to drive that rate higher. And, and we've got three good avenues of which to continue to do that through our traditional markets, these expanded new markets and then this institution's marketplace. So I hope that gives you some color and helps. Yeah, thanks for the question bill. And it's --it's a, it's a good one as you point out in terms of maybe the nuance that sits underneath it.So we look at it this way. We, we launched these three new models at different times, but we, we launched them from a, from a place of a hypothesis around a business model that we took to the marketplace. You get feedback, you'll learn as a part of that. You continue to invest in enrich your capabilities within that model. You successfully deliver it to clients. You begin to build a reputation with those clients around the success of that model and between new capabilities in the building reputation that, that supports momentum. That supports confidence in prospects exploring further this opportunity. And I think naturally leads to in many cases larger opportunities because of that building credibility. So I think that's how we think about the Swiss model and that's the most mature of the new models. We're seeing sort of a similar flight pattern. If you will, with a lens of growth, it's just 6, 7, 8 months behind the trajectory of Swiss and then RIA, we just, we just obviously relaunched in, in April. So hopefully that helps, but we do think it's that growing credibility with delivering a good solution that is serving clients well in the continued evolution of capabilities we'll create that natural lift on, on larger clients, bigger demand, growing pipelines and what we're trying to do is drive a much bigger contribution from those models. Let me take the first half of that, Matt, and you take the second. So yeah, Alex with respect to the advisors look, the, the typical principles that, that one large institution might, might choose or use to, to make the selection to partner with us typically has to do with enhanced technology capabilities. So can we provide them technology, automated workflows, et cetera, to drive efficiency into their practices, free up time for them in their teams to spend on clients and prospects and so that is a priority and we spend a good bit of time making sure that you do the appropriate level of training, coaching, and, and, and, and work to ensure that they can leverage that, that sort of comprehensive technology offering. And that takes time. They don't get that on day one, but you continue to work on it and they become proficient at it quickly. And that becomes a big leverage point. So that is one area that they tend to look at. A second one would be the advisory platform that we have and the breadth of options and alternatives. We give them from a capability set from an investment content from a pricing standpoint, from a vertical integration and ease of doing business that that certainly is a, is a way for them to, to provide expanded or enhanced value of advice to their, to their end clients ultimately help them differentiate and support their growth aspirations. And so there you get a great client experience at the end of the day, matched with also some tailwinds for growth. And so that would be a second area that I would tend to highlight. And if you look at the institutions at a macro level, right our ability to partner in and provide a good deal of support and advice through -- through the compliance and risk management support that we can provide shifts the risk profile for them with this business initiative. And I think creates at an institutional level unimportant element of value. A second one is just improved and enhanced economics typically shifting from a, a model where you've got the entire cost structure and then have to make the investment labor and technology, et cetera, to do it. And you can go to a more outsourced arrangement. We typically see an improvement and enhancement and overall economic, so I'll stop there, but those were maybe some high level things that are in it for the, for the advisors and their clients, as well as the institution as a whole. Yeah. Maybe I'll give you just a quick snapshot of the product portfolio. And then and then I can answer your question about maybe some of the early interests from the Waddell & Reed folks, and, and then happy to share the three that we've got in pilot phase. And so if you look at the, the, the solutions today, as I mentioned, there's seven there's the original three, which were admin solution, CFO and marketing. With respect to Waddell & Reed, the most popular one for them thus far has been admin solutions, which makes sense if you're thinking about coming in and learning a new environment and making the transition. So and you've got people in the LPL ecosystem that are experienced in supporting and helping do that. I think that's a, that's a, that's a logical place to look for a leverage point. And if you didn't have access to that admin at the, the market rates of hiring someone directly, this is, this is actually a new service and a good alternative, lower cost way to do that. With respect to the solutions then that we've added to that original portfolio, you've got the assurance plan which is we just rolled out the resilience plan and those two are ways of which to support and help advisors plan for unexpected and or expected transitions from the business. So assurance plan was the old plan that if unfortunately it kind of gave someone downside protection if something happened to them unexpectedly and the, in the business had to be transitioned. This gives them an orderly way to, to make that transition to do that resilience plan was added as a, as an ideation from that in a learning and a feedback that advisors really liked the assurance plan, but they also said, well, what if we have a short term disruption in our ability to operate or run the business, could you help us with that as well? And so that's where we came up with this idea with the resilience plan that gives them some support and a backstop, if they had an unexpected problem, think about disability or something like that, or if they even have a planned need to have an extended leave from the business such as a fraternity or maternity type of leaves. And so pretty cool innovation that came from the feedback and the appeal of the insurance plan. There's also M&A solutions that we've launched earlier in the year and remote office solutions that emerged during the pandemic, the three they're in pilot real quickly, you've got a bookkeeping solution that we're experimenting with that was born out of the, the CFO solution. And I continued innovation from the feedback that our clients give us on their needs. There's a paraplanning solution in pilot. And then finally something we call it client engage, which is meant to be a way to support and help the advisors managing successfully the servicing communications with their clients. I'll pause there, but that's, that's that gives you a quick snapshot of the portfolio. Yeah. Maybe we both can give some color on that. I'll start Matt, you feel free to provide any insights. So obviously from a strategic standpoint, we, we have a significant set of considerations that you always think about and you're diligent around always evolving your assessment, given changes in the marketplace, changes in the business changes in the competitive landscape. And so potentially being a bank is one of those things that we would always keep active sort of that assessment in that consideration. And I think we would look at it from a strategic standpoint, are there capabilities that, that -- that could potentially support advisors and their value to clients. And is it a better way to manage ultimately, our, our cash balances and, or ultimately deploy and execute against some of that expanded capability that I was mentioned earlier. And so I think we always look at it from the standpoint of what's the best way to do that, right The old do, do we do it ourselves or do we outsource it The marketplace has given us lots of options of which to find different ways to provide capabilities and, and to effectively manage our cash balances using someone else's balance sheet to do that. And we think that strategically makes sense in the short run, as long as we find the options and alternatives to do that, and we can deliver the capabilities that our clients need. And that's kind of how we see it in the short run, but I think we continually look at the different market dynamics and keep that assessment alive, just so it's fresh, we're clear and have the most informed view that we can about our set of options.I'll pause there. You want to add anything to that? Yeah, that's a good, it's a great question. And it's one from an, an operational execution standpoint, I think we're, we're keen on exploring what are those sort of world of possibilities and how we might best do that. So if I just gave you a little color on areas that we think about, there's certainly leveraging robotics, as you say, for more repetitive type of work where as you expand and you grow and you can transform that work into, to a more automated type of solution makes tons of sense in the short run from potential expense synergies. But adds a lot from a scalability standpoint,so across our operations and our compliance organizations you see opportunities for robotics. You also have opportunities to use AI for quicker assessments and more robust, broader spectrum assessments. So think about the efficacy of oversight of our own compliance controls or risk management controls. And that's a place where you could use AI to step in as a, as a real leverage point for for the work that, that our folks do. And in that case, that may not eliminate jobs, but that may create lots of scalability as you go forward because of the more efficient, effective use of automation to assess greater and greater volumes of, of, of business. So that would be another example, I think, where you could use newer technology with you, if you will, our automation and deploy it within the organization. Maybe I'll pause there. And I don't know if you want to take on the implications or contribution that may occur from that. And I think that same approach as allude have going forward. Yeah. I'd leave you with this. Think about it as dry using automation and technology and modern technology to drive the future advisor and end client experience the efficacy of your risk management oversight, and finally third scalability in the overall operations. Thanks much RJ. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. And we look forward to speaking with you again. Next quarter, have a great day"

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call for LPL Financial Holdings Inc. Joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call will be open for questions. The company would appreciate if analysts would limit themselves to one question and one follow-up each.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Kirby, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continue to be a source of extraordinary support and guidance for their clients. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This combination positions us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of over $950 billion, up more than 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, first quarter net new assets were $29 billion, which included $12 billion from BMO Harris Financial Advisors. This result translated to double-digit annualized growth of 13%, driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. First quarter recruited assets were $24 billion, which includes $15 billion from BMO. This result brought our total recruited assets over the past year to a new high of $56 billion. Our continued progress on recruiting is primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and the expanded flexibility of our platform. At the same time, we further enhanced the advisor experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention remained solid at 98% in the first quarter and Net Promoter Scores increased year-over-year. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost. Let's now turn to the progress we have made executing our strategic plan. As a reminder, we have evolved our long-term vision. We aspire to expand beyond our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time, and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor centered marketplace. Now our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to use with the flexibility to construct the perfect practice for themselves and their clients. This approach breaks down the walls between traditional market segments and instead focuses on creating total empowerment for LPL advisors to thrive and that is the heart of our mission. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practice. By winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but to also increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets, while overall industry advisor movement remained at lower levels in the first quarter, we continue to gain share and grow our pipeline. Looking more specifically at the regional bank segment of our financial institution channel, we onboarded BMO Harris Financial Advisors in late March. We continue to prepare for M&T to join in the next few months and we advanced conversations with additional prospects. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building in our new affiliation models. Earlier this month, we onboarded two new practices to Strategic Wealth Services, bringing us to a total of seven on the platform. And earlier this week, we added another advisor to our employee-based model. Looking ahead, we feel good about our pipeline for both of these models. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a complement to organic growth. With respect to our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business, we now have commitments from Waddell & Reed advisors who serve approximately 95% of client assets. We are engaging closely with these advisors to help them prepare to transition to LPL and begin leveraging our platform to serve their clients and grow their businesses. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is enriching the end client experience. Advisory platforms are increasingly at the center of the end-client experience as the secular trend toward advisory continues in our business and across the industry. Given this, we remain focused on providing our advisors with an industry-leading advisory platform, including a number of recent enhancements. Within the quarter, we introduced simplified pricing and lowered account minimums on our centrally managed platforms. We also expanded our no-transaction-fee ETF product offering, which now serves about 40% of ETF assets in advisory accounts. At the same time, we are introducing new platform capabilities in the spirit of creating a differentiated UMA offering that combines multiple centrally managed portfolios within a single account. These enhancements increase the appeal, accessibility and flexibility of our advisory offering, which in turn supports our advisors' efforts to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients and that, in turn, helps drive advisor retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel client care model that provides our advisors with differentiated service. In Q1, we completed the rollout of live chat as a complement to our voice channel. Advisors now have a choice of either voice or chat to efficiently connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Our next step is completing the rollout of our digital self-service experience, which, together with voice and chat will position advisors to access industry-leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations. In Q1, our area of focus included enhancing the administrative support around tax season, digitizing forms and automating account transfers. Enhancements in these areas are helping strengthen the advisor experience and the scalability of our platform as our business grows. By remaining focused on the transformation of our service model into a client care model and continuous improvement through the automation and streamlining of our service operations, we believe we are making positive contributions to the service experience, advisor retention and Net Promoter Scores. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which help advisors operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. As we discussed last quarter, we see several pathways for continued business solutions growth, including partnering with more of our advisors, introducing new solutions to the portfolio and experimenting with serving advisors outside LPL. In the first quarter, our subscription base continued to scale to about 1,700 monthly subscriptions, that generated annualized revenue of approximately $19 million. This growth was primarily driven by our ongoing expansion and evolution of the value proposition of our existing portfolio. Looking at our product road map, we continue to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions, while expanding into new offerings. In Q1, we launched M&A solutions, which is generating solid demand, including over 50 advisors who are leveraging this offering today. In Q2, we plan to introduce our seventh business solution, Client Engage. Now this is -- this evolved from our existing marketing offering and is focused on providing advisors with a digital approach to effectively and efficiently stay connected with their clients. As we look outside LPL, we plan to begin marketing M&A solutions later this year. By experimenting with this scalable technology-driven solution, we can efficiently learn from serving outside advisors, while continuing to focus our resources and investments on delivering business solutions to LPL advisors. Now before closing, I also want to highlight that we released our 2021 sustainability report last week. We believe operating a sustainable business is good for all of our stakeholders. We hope this report provides helpful insight into our practices and performance. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2021, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history. And in addition, we are in the midst of onboarding what will become three of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. We expect these three partners to collectively add approximately $100 billion of AUM to our platform, bringing our total AUM to over $1 trillion. Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $958 billion, up 6% from Q4, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $29 billion, which translates to a 12.8% annualized growth rate. Prior to large bank onboarding, organic growth was 7.6%. Moving on to recruiting and retention. We continue to produce strong results in the first quarter. Recruited assets in Q1 were the strongest in our history at $24 billion, which included $15 billion from large bank onboarding. These results brought our 12-month recruiting total to a new high of $56 billion. Looking at retention, it remained strong at 98.1%. I would also note that we updated our retention metric to reflect asset retention rather than our previous method of production retention. We believe this change will be more helpful in evaluating our business results, and we have provided historical data in our Key Metrics presentation, so you can see both the old and new metric. Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $23 billion or a 20% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 52% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend toward advisory. Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77. Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $579 million, up $46 million or 9% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $184 million, up $31 million from Q4, primarily driven by organic growth and seasonally lower production expense. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $168 million in Q1, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Turning to client cash revenues. They were $97 million, down $8 million from Q4, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $48 million, roughly flat with last quarter. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 99 basis points, down nine basis points from Q4. The decrease during the quarter was primarily driven by fixed rate and LIBOR-based contracts that matured and lower short-term interest rates. Looking ahead to Q2, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured in Q1 as well as another $1 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q2. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we would expect our Q2 ICA yield to be in the mid-90 basis point range. I would also note, we have no additional fixed rate contracts maturing in the second half of this year. Moving on to Q1 transaction and fee revenues. They were $141 million, up $11 million sequentially, driven by trading volume that increased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, trading activity in April has declined from the elevated levels we saw in Q1. And if this trend continues through the quarter, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by about $10 million. Turning to Business Solutions. They continue to scale with 1,700 subscriptions at the end of Q1. This is up 300 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $19 million of annual revenue, up from $17 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $236 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 core G&A to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed. Moving on to Q1 promotional expenses. They were $54 million, up $6 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from higher recruiting and large bank onboarding expenses. Turning to Q2, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $5 million prior to Waddell & Reed, primarily driven by increased transition assistance and large bank onboarding expenses. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $11 million in Q1, up from $8 million in Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect share-based compensation expense to be at a similar level to Q1. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $35 million in Q1, up $7 million sequentially as several improvements to our advisory platform and end-client experience were rolled out sooner than anticipated. Looking ahead, we expect depreciation in Q2 to be in line with Q1 levels. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The transaction is progressing better than we originally estimated across multiple fronts. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisor is serving approximately 95% of client assets have committed to join our platform. Factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels, we expect the run rate EBITDA benefit from Waddell & Reed to be at least $80 million, up from our original $50 million estimate. As a result of the higher retention, we now expect $110 million of acquisition costs, up from our original estimate of $85 million. These updates bring our estimated purchase multiple to five times EBITDA, an improvement from our original estimate of 6.5 times EBITDA. Now I want to provide an update on our expected close timing. Over the past several months, we have had strong collaboration with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, and we have received the required regulatory approvals. As a result, we are pleased to share that we anticipate closing the acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business as early as tomorrow. And we continue to expect to onboard the advisors a few months after closing. Looking ahead, we are focused on providing transparency on the progress we are making on the transaction. With this in mind, we will share Waddell & Reed financial results in two primary categories. First, to provide more clarity around our results, we have added an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L. Looking at Q2, we expect roughly one-third of our total acquisition costs to be incurred during the quarter. Second, we will keep you updated each quarter on how we expect EBITDA to build as we progress toward hitting the full run rate benefit by the middle of 2022. In Q2, we expect annualized negative run rate EBITDA of approximately $10 million as we add resources to prepare to support Waddell & Reed. Moving on to capital management, starting with our debt refinancing. Given the continued strength of our business, combined with the low interest rate environment, we were able to refinance our highest cost debt from 5.75% to 4%, reducing our annual interest expense by $13 million. We were also able to increase the size of our revolver from $750 million to $1 billion. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the near term, we continue to expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities. And if at that time, we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our options look like at that time. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nQ - Bill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much and good evening, everybody. So maybe, Dan, to start off with you. It seems like I'm seeing from the headlines in your comments that the -- there's been acceleration in both Strategic Wealth Services and building so on sort of the independent play side. What's changing at the margin here? Is it just time or maybe a sense of maybe peel back a layer sort of what's been the incremental change in the marketplace that's resonating better?\nDan Arnold: Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. And as a reminder, we just launched these last year, SWS in April and then the employee model in the second half of last year. And as you know, it takes a bit of positioning in the marketplace, seasoning, iterating on your value proposition as you learn and you get feedback, bringing on clients and then having a good experience and being able to use them as a reference to future prospects and considerations. We've also continued to invest and enhance in the talent on our business development team. So a combination of those things are driving a bigger pipeline, better positioning out in the marketplace from a competitive standpoint, building on existing clients who are having a good experience and then finally using that quality talent to ultimately help go execute. So that's a similar concept for both. SWS, or Strategic Wealth Services, is a bit ahead of the independent employee model only because it started several months earlier, but you can see them on a similar trajectory. I hope that helps.\nBill Katz: Yes. Thanks. And then maybe one just for Matt. I guess one of the themes that's been coming out is sort of this excess liquidity in the system overall. I think you mentioned in the last quarter as well. Can you sort of maybe update us your thinking on how to sort of track through fixed to float or float to fix, I should say, and so the ability to sort of drive the third-party sweep opportunity?\nMatt Audette: Yes. Sure, Bill. I think that -- maybe just starting with our strategy and goals here, which are really unchanged, specifically on the fixed rate deposit side, which is really to get to a place where 50% to 75% of the portfolio is fixed. So I think from a long-term perspective, that's where we're headed. But I think to the point of your question and similar to last quarter is when you look at the amount of liquidity in the system right now, there's really just very little demand for deposits. That said, I think you're starting to see some early indicators of that changing and maybe really early indicators, but things like the yield curve starting to steepen, right? The 10-year moving up, where there's a -- for those banks that are on the demand side of these deposits, there's some economics in the spread for them to invest it. Consumer spending picking up, right? There's trillions of dollars in savings and checking accounts that's built up over the pandemic. And as that spending picks up, that going back into the market is one of the things that could lead to that demand. So if those trends continue, I think those are some of the things that could start to change and improve that demand. But I'd emphasize we're not seeing that pick up today. But I'd just end with, I think, our long-term strategy of moving into that 50% to 75% fixed zone. When there is demand, we feel really good about being able to execute it then.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven, your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey. Dan, Matt, good afternoon. So I wanted to start off with a question on M&A and the appetite for more transformational deals. In August '17, you announced the NPH transaction. You retained about 70% of the assets as part of the deal. Since then, you've made a lot of enhancements, whether it's investments in digital or just to the platform more broadly and fast forward to Waddell and now you've retained 95%. So just given that much stronger retention and the favorable experience with Waddell, given all the metrics you have in cited. I'm just curious whether that increases your appetite to do more transformational deals as a much higher retention significantly impact some of the future deal math?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So Steven, it's Dan. So look, I think we continue to see M&A from a strategy standpoint as a complement to our organic growth and as you know, we look across the lens of growth opportunities or acceleration of capabilities. And so that hasn't changed in our overall strategy. We do believe that if we're good at executing on these transactions, then that becomes an interesting differentiator and an opportunity for us in terms of how we might structure a deal, value a deal, etc. And so we are staying disciplined on making sure with every acquisition that we learned from those and we apply those insights and learnings such that we can execute better the next time. If you look at the drivers of the difference in these two transactions, I think most of it were activities that we control or drive, where we maybe didn't do them as well back in 2017, '18 and we did them much better today. Things like being able to automate and streamline the transition of asset and advisors moving from one place to the next. You take the friction out and help them continue to focus on their clients, that's a pretty appealing scenario. Our ability to take a strategy and go deliver it in a simple articulate manner to help advisors understand what that experience would be like, what their structure, what their economics will be like on the other side of that transaction and do it at pace and clear, you begin to create the right dialogues very quickly that lead to good outcomes. And so those are things that as examples that we continue to learn and evolve and get better in terms of our ability to execute. So as we go forward, to your point, do we think there's continued consolidation, both in what I might call the smaller transactions across the entire spectrum, the larger transactions? Yes. Would we continue to have an opening and exploring and potentially participating in some of that consolidation? I think based on our strategy, the absolute answer would be yes. And to the extent that we get better and better at executing on these, we will use that insight perspective and advantage to think about how we consider approaching them.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that color, Dan. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the centrally managed platform. I mean the assets grew organically at a very impressive 47% rate. It looks like the bulk of the increase in the quarter was tied to the BMO onboarding. I was hoping you could speak to what drove such strong demand for the centrally managed product just from those advisors. And should we expect a higher ROA on those assets given the more attractive economics of centrally managed?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Steven, it's great observation in that you did see solid growth in centrally managed platforms. And you're continuing to see that underlying strong baseline growth and utilization of that platform increase, right? So that didn't change in the first quarter across our entire platform. And as we invest and add capabilities, investment content, lower price, we think those centrally managed solutions only become that much more appealing. And then you complement that or add that to, in this case, BMO's utilization of centrally managed solutions and that creates a really interesting opportunity not only for us to think about how we expand and grow our centrally managed platform, but even unique capabilities, we may put inside of it that are helpful and supportive of large institutions. And then all the way finally to large institutions or users of models-based approach and our robust centrally managed solution with MWP enables them to leverage both the growing momentum their advisors have in this space, the great talent they have to serve and support their clients, matched with a platform that is really well aligned with their needs and the way they serve their clients. And that is a pretty interesting formula that certainly drives higher ROA with the more advisory they do and then the utilization of those centrally managed platforms. Today, BMO's business is about one-third advisory, two-third brokerage. So as we go forward, we think our platform is a nice tool and a leverage point to help them as they evolve their business in order to serve their clients in the best way possible.\nSteven Chubak: That's great color, Dan. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nDan Arnold: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I was hoping to zone in on the retention stats you guys provided, not just for Waddell, but obviously for the book as a whole. It looks like you guys are running at about 98% overall retention on the assets. It's quite a bit above from where we've been historically. And I think, Dan, you talked about the pandemic being sort of one of the reasons why retention might be strong, albeit maybe temporarily. It feels like it's sticking around. So I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on whether or not we sort of entering a bit of a new paradigm with the retention of the assets being as high as it's been recently.\nDan Arnold: Yes, absolutely. As you say, if you look back historically, three years, you saw more of a retention rate in the 96% range. We saw -- if you look over the last 12 months, a retention range in the 97.5% level. So as you've said, we've seen some good stability in that 97% to 98% range for the better part of the last three quarters, which would indicate there's good staying power beyond the pandemic as you return to what I might call normal movement of advisors in the marketplace. And so we're encouraged by that. We continue to invest in the model to improve that service experience, expand the capabilities and deliver those to our advisors such that it helps support them operate an efficient practice and effective practice, serve their clients and grow their business, and you would expect retention rates to be pretty sticky. For us, we're trying to manage in that 97% to 98% range and think that's a pretty good solid outcome and a good sustainable place to operate in if we're doing our job of investing in our model, ensuring it's delivering the right value for our clients.\nAlex Blostein: Got you. Thanks for that. And Matt, a follow-up for you around expenses, I was just hoping to unpack that a little bit. So it sounds like the guidance obviously does not include any expenses related to Waddell & Reed, whether it's kind of their expenses coming on or I guess, expenses that you anticipate to kind of facilitate the transition, if I'm hearing that correctly? So kind of like the $10 million annualized EBITDA drag, for instance, that you're highlighting in the second quarter. That expense is not in your full year expense guide. I just want to, I guess, confirm that. And also, maybe you can help us think through expenses, core G&A inclusive of Waddell. And I guess, secondarily, as you guys pointed out in the slide, first quarter core G&A run rate is below the full year guide. So you anticipate a bit of a ramp. So maybe just kind of walk us through the sources of that ramp.\nMatt Audette: Alex, I think that was a three-part question. I'll answer. I think -- so you're correct. I think that the guidance of $975 million to $1 billion core G&A, that's excluding Waddell. And the reason for that is just as we ramp up both on the EBITDA side as well as the acquisition costs, I think our perspective was the way to give you the most clarity on that is to really keep them separate. Knowing that Waddell between both the revenues and gross profit and expenses, we're going to be ramping over roughly a year period to that $80 million run rate. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think obviously, when we get to the other side, everything will be put together from a dialogue and a guidance standpoint. I think -- we think that will be the most clear path and way to understand the core or existing business, if you will, as well as how and when, Waddell comes on board. So I think that covers questions one and two. Question three, on how the existing business is ramping. And it's really pretty similar to what you've seen in prior years, which is you kind of steadily ramp throughout the year, meaning that Q1 run rate, I think probably the premise of your question or the genesis of your question is where our run rate right now is kind of below the low end of that range. And it's just that natural ramping during the year. And I think you saw that last year as well. So that would be our expectation this year.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for that.\nMatt Audette: Yes.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, guys. I had a follow-up on Steve's earlier question on the centrally managed platform. We know this business is highly gross profit ROA and ROCA accretive, but can you walk us through the math relative to your advisory assets that are not on the centrally managed platform?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Craig, I think the dynamics haven't really changed. I think centrally managed usually adds about 10 basis points. I think we've got good disclosures in our investor deck on that. So I think the dynamics there are really pretty similar to what we have there. I think what I would add and note specific to BMO, just to build on Dan's comments earlier because that was a big driver in centrally managed for the quarter. When you look at those large financial institutions, right, those are contracts that are negotiated overall. And specific to large financial institutions, they typically start with a high percentage of brokerage, which brokerage assets overall are in that 15 to 20 basis point range. And just given the positive mixes at BMO that Dan highlighted, one-third of the assets in advisory and then a lot of that going into centrally managed. I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that BMO will be at the higher end of that range. The only thing I would add is similar to M&A, those contracts, usually, there's some ramping, right? The first couple of years usually have some incentives, not dissimilar from what we're just talking about on the ramp for Waddell & Reed. So as that ramp occurs, just as an overall point on BMO really coming out of the high concentration in advisory and centrally managed, you've got a really accretive from a margin standpoint versus our current margin on that business. So hopefully that helps.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Matt. And just circling back on cash sweep. How should we think about the near term opportunity to reinvest the $6 billion of overflow balances?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think when you look at the kind of the floating side of the sweep dynamic, it's really pretty similar to what's going on in the fixed contract side and that there's just not a lot of new demand. So if you think about those contracts in a normalized environment, you typically see them at a spread of 20 to 30 basis points versus Fed funds. And in this environment, you're really seeing them kind of Fed funds flat to Fed funds minus 5%. So I think that's kind of how I think of the marginal investment rates there. And this maybe give you just a little bit of color on those as those things mature, right? When you think about floating rate contracts, the nature of those are usually a one- to two-year contracts that typically roll into new periods pretty often. So just to give you context for us for the rest of the year, if you look past the Q2 guidance I gave on ICA overall, so kind of looking in the second half of the year. And if the contracts that mature in that period, if they -- if we invest -- reinvest all of them, Craig, to your question in current rates, that would bring the overall ICA yield down by just a couple of basis points by the end of the year. So it's a relatively small reinvestment risk there. And then add to that with no additional fixed maturities in the second half of the year, it kind of gives you, I think, a good perspective on overall ICA rates. There's not a lot of downside risk, at least in the current environment in the second half of the year. You're talking mid-90s to low 90s is just the way to think about it.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on the Business Solutions, I think you had quoted about $19 million of revenue annualized. I was just hoping you could maybe help us appreciate the profit margin on that, the gross profit contribution to that. And then just also maybe you can elaborate a little bit on some of the initiatives you have in place on expanding that out and growing the penetration within the existing advisor base?\nDan Arnold: You want to take the economics on the first half, and I'll get the second.\nMatt Audette: Yes, you got it. Mike, I think that when you look at Business Solutions, I think that there's two ways to think through it. First is on the economics. And I would think of it as a capability and a product that's generating fee revenue like we discussed. And then in addition to that, I think probably one of the more interesting parts of Business Solutions is really what that positions advisors that are utilizing them to do, right? It's about us helping them really run their small business in a really efficient and effective way that frees them up to be focused on the wealth management side, right, to deliver same-store sales and grow their practices or position them to do acquisitions with our new M&A solution. So I would really view that the financial benefits of Business Solutions really in a holistic way for the entire firm given the different types of dynamics that, that can drive.\nDan Arnold: Yes. And maybe to build on your product road map question, as we look at our different options and alternatives to expand the portfolio and thus reach either more LPL advisors and/or sell existing advisors additional services, this, again, is based on the premise that they are engaging in many of these services at a local level. So our concept is we can offer them at a higher quality and perhaps at a cheaper cost, a pretty appealing combination. And so if you think about our road map today, you've got the original three offerings, which were admin solution, a CFO solution and a marketing solution. So what we're doing with each one of those is we're exploring, can we create new variations of those offerings, of which might have a narrower value proposition, a lower price point and solve a specific problem or challenge that an advisor has to address on a weekly, monthly reoccurring basis. And so we are working inside our product portfolio across that entire spectrum of offerings to come up with new iterations on that. And you'll see a couple under the CFO solution, one that we're about to begin to go to pilot in Q2 that I mentioned earlier, and that was a derivative of our marketing solutions. And so that's kind of innovation area number one of the road map. The second one is we continue to experiment with new capabilities or new solutions. A great example of that would be experimenting with paraplanning, if you will. A whole new offering with respect to the professional services portfolio, but one that we're testing right now out in the marketplace, learning, iterating and potentially will become a whole new solution, if you will, to that portfolio. So that would be an example of a new solution. M&A solution would fit into that category of new offerings. And so those are the two primary places that we tend to explore, how do we expand the product road map and thus create more and more value that our advisors can leverage to replace that spend that we estimate is close to $1.5 billion a year that they spend on local level services. So that's what's driving that road map. I hope that helps.\nMichael Cyprys: Got it. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up here just on the expense side. It looked like the share-based comp and D&A were both up meaningfully on a sequential and year-on-year basis. I know you gave some guidance into the second quarter. But just curious, I guess, any color on what's driving that and how you would expect this to sort of trend over the next couple of years? Should these lines grow in line with AUM growth or something else or some multiplier to that?\nMatt Audette: Yes. On share-based comp, and you see the dynamic Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 kind of close and then it drops down in the second half of the year. And it's really about the timing of those grants that kind of drives that dynamic. So that's on share-based comp. On depreciation, I think a little bit of context there. The depreciation and amortization is largely driven by our technology spend. And obviously, that's the area where we're focused on developing capabilities that are key drivers of organic growth. And I think the key P&L dynamic to note that you probably know, but I'll highlight anyways, is that the expense really changes when you deploy the technology, not when you're spending the money. And when you look at Q1, we just had some larger projects that we deployed and rolled out. Dan covered a few of them in his prepared remarks. So that really started the depreciation and expense associated with that. So if you look at the few quarters leading up to this quarter, you saw relatively low or small increases in depreciation, and we would expect a similar dynamic in the next few quarters. So it's really just that kind of concentrated deployment. The overall tech spend trends have been pretty consistent and unchanged from our overall expectations. So I hope that helps.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.\nChris Harris: Great, thanks. So you guys are -- I mean LPL is just growing so incredibly fast right now. Can you maybe talk a bit about how you guys are feeling about the platform from a capacity perspective? In other words, you have the capacity in place, the services in place to be able to support all the incremental growth you're seeing and expected to see.\nDan Arnold: Yes, it's a great question. And I think it goes back to the start of our mission, right? We got to take care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients, which means we've got to make sure that we're there for them day in, day out from a service experience standpoint, that our platform has the stability necessary to leverage it and utilize it and then ultimately we're providing them the capabilities to create efficient workflows and capabilities to help them differentiate with their clients and continue to win. And we've got to make sure that we give them the tools necessary to pivot their businesses into a multichannel service business, where it's no longer just in person. They got to do it in a combined digital and in-person way. So there's a tremendous opportunity for this platform to show up and support and help them and add value every single day, and that comes first and foremost for them. So our -- we've got to be diligent around making sure that we understand and plan for that growth, well, that we've got the technology and engineering capabilities of which to build the tools that are necessary and scale the platform. We've got to make sure that we've got the fine-tuning, the testing, the utilization of AI to help us with respect to the risk management of our overall platform and stability, privacy, etc., associated with it. So that operating muscle to be really strong to execute on our plan comes first and foremost for us. I'd love to tell you we're perfect at it. We also have to have the humility to constantly listen to feedback. And if we're not getting something right to quickly focus on addressing it and iterating and then ultimately getting better because of it. And so I think that's a principle and the foundation of how we operate and execute. Then we got to make sure that we're investing in the right people, attracting the right talent that we've got the right size talent that is well aligned and positioned to collaborate and execute together to deliver on our expectations. So that comes number two, what are our operating metrics, how do we observe, measure, how we operate not on a weekly or a monthly basis, but on a daily basis. So it's that we can take that data, learn from it, fine-tune, revise, iterate, etc, to make sure that we can be the best that we can be every day. And then finally, we got to be investing in technology and automation that helps us scale. So you can scale into bursts of growth or you can constantly with consistent sustainable growth that you are constantly improving and enhancing your performance because you're able to digitize and automate it from end to end throughout the ecosystem, not to mention the benefits that you get from a scalability from an economic standpoint by doing that. So we continue to work on that. Introducing robotics, deploying AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem in order to do that. And so we've got a lot of passion for doing it. We're not perfect. We hold ourselves uber accountable to our NPS scores. We've got room to improve, and it's priority one for the firm. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Gerry, your line is now open.\nGerry O'Hara: Maybe circling back to Business Solutions. Just curious if you have tracked or have kept any data points around the overlap among advisors as it relates to the various different solutions. It almost strikes me as though if you could kind of get the adoption of one such as admin solution or CFO solution that could work as a gateway to additional, but not sure if you sort of track that or seen that metric develop?\nDan Arnold: I think that's great strategic utility. And I think that is a good hypothesis and a premise that we are seeing trend once someone is engaged in a service, if they're having good success and it's a good leverage point, there's a higher propensity to use another one. I think as we iterate on the portfolio and expand the different offerings and you create, as an example, not just a holistic CFO offering, but you can take elements of what a CFO's role might be, bookkeeping as an example, or FP&A work, and you're able to create discrete products out of things like that. I think your premise of sort of a land-and-expand strategy makes even more sense. And so there's more to play out on that as we evolve our product road map. But we are trying to also be digital first and use data of which to learn and understand how our clients are engaging with us, both so that we can improve our offering, better -- deliver a better service experience to them across this portfolio. It's a good question.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. Fair enough. And then perhaps you can remind us what the mix on the $100 billion of assets that's going to be onboarded across the two banks and Waddell as it relates to fee-based advisory versus more traditional commission-based business. I think you just sort of highlighted earlier, the BMO mix. But if you could just kind of remind us what that aggregate split is that would be helpful.\nMatt Audette: Yes. Gerry, I think, well, we can be directional here. I think to the point on BMO, they're a little bit higher on the advisory side than your typical large financial institution, right, meaning M&T would be more focused on the brokerage side. And then Waddell, I think as we're near closing and then onboarding, I think we'll give you more specifics on that in the near future.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions this evening.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan, your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This one, you might -- it might be -- have been answered by the last question on Waddell and the fact that more details are coming. But I wanted to follow up on Alex's question earlier to see whether or not we could get some -- maybe some more granularity on the profile of what it will look like? Are FAs going to ramp over time over that year? Or is there -- how should we assume that will come on board, both the revenues and the expenses when we think about modeling it? Or was your last comment basically to say that you're not really in a position to say and we got to hold our horses for these questions?\nMatt Audette: Yes, I think I liked it a little bit between those two points. So I think if you look at -- we did some updated disclosures in our key metric materials if you have those handy, I'll speak to them on Pages seven and eight. But I think you've got the mix of Waddell at the time we announced the deal, which is a little bit over 50% brokerage, so 45% advisory, 55% brokerage. At least you can see what it looked like back then. I think on the ramp, I'd highlight a few things. And this is where we added some detail on Slide eight, just to think about our path from closing, which could be as early as tomorrow to hitting that run rate EBITDA of $80 million. And there's really, I think, three broad steps that are happening that would drive it. And that's why I was giving a little bit of color on earlier. It's first and foremost is really adding the resources and technology and expenses, maybe to build a little bit on the question Dan was just answering just to make sure that we are in a position to receive Waddell the company at closing and to onboard the advisors a few months after that. So the expenses start first. I think then onboarding, we think it will happen a few months after closing, so call it a few months from now. And that's really where the gross profit synergies start, right? Once the advisors and their assets are on our platform, and then following that, it's really your classic M&A integration work to get the expense synergies. And we think that will take about a full year from close. So you kind of put all that together. And that's, I think, a pretty good road map from here till hitting that run rate EBITDA and using that time line that I just walked through kind of by the end of Q2 of next year of 2022.\nDan Arnold: Dan H. Arnold -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. In that maybe one helpful comment. Relative to your gross profit point because this is an acquisition, the ramp of the advisors is different than a normal recruiting scenario. So the assets and the advisors will all come over in mass. So let's say, we close tomorrow, let's just say, three months later, the assets come over a weekend and the advisors come over a weekend. And so they will be all on our platform. So your ability to begin ramping from that point is solid and a little different from recruiting where you ramp in over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.\nBrennan Hawken: It does. Thanks. It almost sort of suggests it's more like a step function than a ramp to some degree. Thanks for that. Also kind of curious about thinking about the impact of the reopening of the economy and the idea that people are going to start getting more comfortable with face-to-face meetings with vaccines rolling out as successfully as they have been. How should we think about -- there's a couple of different perspectives I'm curious about. Number one, from a recruiting perspective, is that going to put a bit more expense back into the recruiting effort versus before? Or are -- have you learned that you can be so much more efficient recruiting in a Zoom world that you'll keep a lot of the recruiting efforts to Zoom, that's one angle. And then from another angle, thinking about the advisors and the net new assets over the past year, how much of those -- has the amount that normally comes from an advisor's existing book of business been impacted by the fact that they can't do prospecting, dinners or seminars or what have you. And do you expect that, that might start to kick back in now that people will be coming back to restaurants and whatnot? And maybe what kind of an impact do you think that could have? Sorry for the multi-parter.\nDan Arnold: No, there's a lot there. So let me give you a directional answer of that, just I think to give you some guideposts and in some places, not to try to be overly precise on something we don't exactly know, right? So with respect to recruiting, your first part of your question, I think the short answer is it does not go back to what it was before, but it doesn't necessarily stay what it is today. And I do believe that we've continued to recruit throughout. We've had some people doing some travel throughout. We've been incurring some expense relative to our business development activities, right, the sort of the core G&A expenses associated with that. But we have used technology and learn to use technology in a much, much more creative way, and we've broken through and set new paradigms, if you will, on how to do that in acceptable ways to do that and gotten better at it over the years. So I actually think you'll see a mix where we'll use technology where it's more efficient, it's less wear and tear. And quite frankly, it's more appealing for the advisors or the prospect as well as for our business development resources as an example. And then where we do need to travel and where we do make a difference in face-to-face, we will absolutely do that. So if we do this well, we should find both improved efficiency and efficacy in our business development efforts. So that's how I would answer that one. Again, not trying to be really precise about exactly where the dial goes back to. But I think it's some middle ground. I hope that was helpful to you on the recruiting. On -- with respect to our advisors, a couple of things. Their baselines changed significantly in the first 90 days when the country shut down. But the pace of reopening, as you know, has been very, very different at a local level across the country. And many of our advisors are doing a lot more face-to-face than what we might -- would expect living in bigger cities. And so consequently, I think you've already seen a pivot for a lot of advisors, probably more back to that baseline way they did business. But I think the cool part about our advisors being in businesses for themselves, they've got to be quite innovative and have that entrepreneurial spirit, right, of a small business owner. And most have added this digital capability to their repertoire. So now they've got two ways of which to serve clients, which again, opens up the aperture of their opportunity to increase the size of their book, find more efficient ways to engage with clients, and then ultimately provide a mix of those that would rather meet in person versus those that are good doing it over the video. And you now redefine geography for them by doing that as well. And so we actually think this becomes a really interesting opportunity for our advisors as a catalyst to enhance the service experience, expand the flexibility around it and ultimately use that as a catalyst for growth. Do I think they're going to get back to doing dinners full time like they used to? No, but I do think that dial will go back to what is -- how that advisor uniquely wants to run their practice. So you'll see probably a spectrum of different outcomes depending on the advisor themselves and their clients. I'll stop there.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. Thanks for that color. Helpful.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you so much for our presenters and everyone who participated. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2021, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history. And in addition, we are in the midst of onboarding what will become three of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. We expect these three partners to collectively add approximately $100 billion of AUM to our platform, bringing our total AUM to over $1 trillion. Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $958 billion, up 6% from Q4, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $29 billion, which translates to a 12.8% annualized growth rate. Prior to large bank onboarding, organic growth was 7.6%. Moving on to recruiting and retention. We continue to produce strong results in the first quarter. Recruited assets in Q1 were the strongest in our history at $24 billion, which included $15 billion from large bank onboarding. These results brought our 12-month recruiting total to a new high of $56 billion. Looking at retention, it remained strong at 98.1%. I would also note that we updated our retention metric to reflect asset retention rather than our previous method of production retention. We believe this change will be more helpful in evaluating our business results, and we have provided historical data in our Key Metrics presentation, so you can see both the old and new metric. Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $23 billion or a 20% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 52% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend toward advisory. Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77. Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $579 million, up $46 million or 9% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $184 million, up $31 million from Q4, primarily driven by organic growth and seasonally lower production expense. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $168 million in Q1, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets. Turning to client cash revenues. They were $97 million, down $8 million from Q4, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $48 million, roughly flat with last quarter. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 99 basis points, down nine basis points from Q4. The decrease during the quarter was primarily driven by fixed rate and LIBOR-based contracts that matured and lower short-term interest rates. Looking ahead to Q2, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured in Q1 as well as another $1 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q2. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we would expect our Q2 ICA yield to be in the mid-90 basis point range. I would also note, we have no additional fixed rate contracts maturing in the second half of this year. Moving on to Q1 transaction and fee revenues. They were $141 million, up $11 million sequentially, driven by trading volume that increased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, trading activity in April has declined from the elevated levels we saw in Q1. And if this trend continues through the quarter, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by about $10 million. Turning to Business Solutions. They continue to scale with 1,700 subscriptions at the end of Q1. This is up 300 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $19 million of annual revenue, up from $17 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $236 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 core G&A to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed. Moving on to Q1 promotional expenses. They were $54 million, up $6 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from higher recruiting and large bank onboarding expenses. Turning to Q2, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $5 million prior to Waddell & Reed, primarily driven by increased transition assistance and large bank onboarding expenses. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $11 million in Q1, up from $8 million in Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect share-based compensation expense to be at a similar level to Q1. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $35 million in Q1, up $7 million sequentially as several improvements to our advisory platform and end-client experience were rolled out sooner than anticipated. Looking ahead, we expect depreciation in Q2 to be in line with Q1 levels. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The transaction is progressing better than we originally estimated across multiple fronts. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisor is serving approximately 95% of client assets have committed to join our platform. Factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels, we expect the run rate EBITDA benefit from Waddell & Reed to be at least $80 million, up from our original $50 million estimate. As a result of the higher retention, we now expect $110 million of acquisition costs, up from our original estimate of $85 million. These updates bring our estimated purchase multiple to five times EBITDA, an improvement from our original estimate of 6.5 times EBITDA. Now I want to provide an update on our expected close timing. Over the past several months, we have had strong collaboration with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, and we have received the required regulatory approvals. As a result, we are pleased to share that we anticipate closing the acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business as early as tomorrow. And we continue to expect to onboard the advisors a few months after closing. Looking ahead, we are focused on providing transparency on the progress we are making on the transaction. With this in mind, we will share Waddell & Reed financial results in two primary categories. First, to provide more clarity around our results, we have added an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L. Looking at Q2, we expect roughly one-third of our total acquisition costs to be incurred during the quarter. Second, we will keep you updated each quarter on how we expect EBITDA to build as we progress toward hitting the full run rate benefit by the middle of 2022. In Q2, we expect annualized negative run rate EBITDA of approximately $10 million as we add resources to prepare to support Waddell & Reed. Moving on to capital management, starting with our debt refinancing. Given the continued strength of our business, combined with the low interest rate environment, we were able to refinance our highest cost debt from 5.75% to 4%, reducing our annual interest expense by $13 million. We were also able to increase the size of our revolver from $750 million to $1 billion. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the near term, we continue to expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities. And if at that time, we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our options look like at that time. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes. Sure, Bill. I think that -- maybe just starting with our strategy and goals here, which are really unchanged, specifically on the fixed rate deposit side, which is really to get to a place where 50% to 75% of the portfolio is fixed. So I think from a long-term perspective, that's where we're headed. But I think to the point of your question and similar to last quarter is when you look at the amount of liquidity in the system right now, there's really just very little demand for deposits. That said, I think you're starting to see some early indicators of that changing and maybe really early indicators, but things like the yield curve starting to steepen, right? The 10-year moving up, where there's a -- for those banks that are on the demand side of these deposits, there's some economics in the spread for them to invest it. Consumer spending picking up, right? There's trillions of dollars in savings and checking accounts that's built up over the pandemic. And as that spending picks up, that going back into the market is one of the things that could lead to that demand. So if those trends continue, I think those are some of the things that could start to change and improve that demand. But I'd emphasize we're not seeing that pick up today. But I'd just end with, I think, our long-term strategy of moving into that 50% to 75% fixed zone. When there is demand, we feel really good about being able to execute it then. Alex, I think that was a three-part question. I'll answer. I think -- so you're correct. I think that the guidance of $975 million to $1 billion core G&A, that's excluding Waddell. And the reason for that is just as we ramp up both on the EBITDA side as well as the acquisition costs, I think our perspective was the way to give you the most clarity on that is to really keep them separate. Knowing that Waddell between both the revenues and gross profit and expenses, we're going to be ramping over roughly a year period to that $80 million run rate. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think obviously, when we get to the other side, everything will be put together from a dialogue and a guidance standpoint. I think -- we think that will be the most clear path and way to understand the core or existing business, if you will, as well as how and when, Waddell comes on board. So I think that covers questions one and two. Question three, on how the existing business is ramping. And it's really pretty similar to what you've seen in prior years, which is you kind of steadily ramp throughout the year, meaning that Q1 run rate, I think probably the premise of your question or the genesis of your question is where our run rate right now is kind of below the low end of that range. And it's just that natural ramping during the year. And I think you saw that last year as well. So that would be our expectation this year. Yes. Yes, Craig, I think the dynamics haven't really changed. I think centrally managed usually adds about 10 basis points. I think we've got good disclosures in our investor deck on that. So I think the dynamics there are really pretty similar to what we have there. I think what I would add and note specific to BMO, just to build on Dan's comments earlier because that was a big driver in centrally managed for the quarter. When you look at those large financial institutions, right, those are contracts that are negotiated overall. And specific to large financial institutions, they typically start with a high percentage of brokerage, which brokerage assets overall are in that 15 to 20 basis point range. And just given the positive mixes at BMO that Dan highlighted, one-third of the assets in advisory and then a lot of that going into centrally managed. I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that BMO will be at the higher end of that range. The only thing I would add is similar to M&A, those contracts, usually, there's some ramping, right? The first couple of years usually have some incentives, not dissimilar from what we're just talking about on the ramp for Waddell & Reed. So as that ramp occurs, just as an overall point on BMO really coming out of the high concentration in advisory and centrally managed, you've got a really accretive from a margin standpoint versus our current margin on that business. So hopefully that helps. Yes. I think when you look at the kind of the floating side of the sweep dynamic, it's really pretty similar to what's going on in the fixed contract side and that there's just not a lot of new demand. So if you think about those contracts in a normalized environment, you typically see them at a spread of 20 to 30 basis points versus Fed funds. And in this environment, you're really seeing them kind of Fed funds flat to Fed funds minus 5%. So I think that's kind of how I think of the marginal investment rates there. And this maybe give you just a little bit of color on those as those things mature, right? When you think about floating rate contracts, the nature of those are usually a one- to two-year contracts that typically roll into new periods pretty often. So just to give you context for us for the rest of the year, if you look past the Q2 guidance I gave on ICA overall, so kind of looking in the second half of the year. And if the contracts that mature in that period, if they -- if we invest -- reinvest all of them, Craig, to your question in current rates, that would bring the overall ICA yield down by just a couple of basis points by the end of the year. So it's a relatively small reinvestment risk there. And then add to that with no additional fixed maturities in the second half of the year, it kind of gives you, I think, a good perspective on overall ICA rates. There's not a lot of downside risk, at least in the current environment in the second half of the year. You're talking mid-90s to low 90s is just the way to think about it. Yes, you got it. Mike, I think that when you look at Business Solutions, I think that there's two ways to think through it. First is on the economics. And I would think of it as a capability and a product that's generating fee revenue like we discussed. And then in addition to that, I think probably one of the more interesting parts of Business Solutions is really what that positions advisors that are utilizing them to do, right? It's about us helping them really run their small business in a really efficient and effective way that frees them up to be focused on the wealth management side, right, to deliver same-store sales and grow their practices or position them to do acquisitions with our new M&A solution. So I would really view that the financial benefits of Business Solutions really in a holistic way for the entire firm given the different types of dynamics that, that can drive. Yes. On share-based comp, and you see the dynamic Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 kind of close and then it drops down in the second half of the year. And it's really about the timing of those grants that kind of drives that dynamic. So that's on share-based comp. On depreciation, I think a little bit of context there. The depreciation and amortization is largely driven by our technology spend. And obviously, that's the area where we're focused on developing capabilities that are key drivers of organic growth. And I think the key P&L dynamic to note that you probably know, but I'll highlight anyways, is that the expense really changes when you deploy the technology, not when you're spending the money. And when you look at Q1, we just had some larger projects that we deployed and rolled out. Dan covered a few of them in his prepared remarks. So that really started the depreciation and expense associated with that. So if you look at the few quarters leading up to this quarter, you saw relatively low or small increases in depreciation, and we would expect a similar dynamic in the next few quarters. So it's really just that kind of concentrated deployment. The overall tech spend trends have been pretty consistent and unchanged from our overall expectations. So I hope that helps. Yes. Gerry, I think, well, we can be directional here. I think to the point on BMO, they're a little bit higher on the advisory side than your typical large financial institution, right, meaning M&T would be more focused on the brokerage side. And then Waddell, I think as we're near closing and then onboarding, I think we'll give you more specifics on that in the near future. Yes, I think I liked it a little bit between those two points. So I think if you look at -- we did some updated disclosures in our key metric materials if you have those handy, I'll speak to them on Pages seven and eight. But I think you've got the mix of Waddell at the time we announced the deal, which is a little bit over 50% brokerage, so 45% advisory, 55% brokerage. At least you can see what it looked like back then. I think on the ramp, I'd highlight a few things. And this is where we added some detail on Slide eight, just to think about our path from closing, which could be as early as tomorrow to hitting that run rate EBITDA of $80 million. And there's really, I think, three broad steps that are happening that would drive it. And that's why I was giving a little bit of color on earlier. It's first and foremost is really adding the resources and technology and expenses, maybe to build a little bit on the question Dan was just answering just to make sure that we are in a position to receive Waddell the company at closing and to onboard the advisors a few months after that. So the expenses start first. I think then onboarding, we think it will happen a few months after closing, so call it a few months from now. And that's really where the gross profit synergies start, right? Once the advisors and their assets are on our platform, and then following that, it's really your classic M&A integration work to get the expense synergies. And we think that will take about a full year from close. So you kind of put all that together. And that's, I think, a pretty good road map from here till hitting that run rate EBITDA and using that time line that I just walked through kind of by the end of Q2 of next year of 2022."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Kirby, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continue to be a source of extraordinary support and guidance for their clients. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This combination positions us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of over $950 billion, up more than 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, first quarter net new assets were $29 billion, which included $12 billion from BMO Harris Financial Advisors. This result translated to double-digit annualized growth of 13%, driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. First quarter recruited assets were $24 billion, which includes $15 billion from BMO. This result brought our total recruited assets over the past year to a new high of $56 billion. Our continued progress on recruiting is primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and the expanded flexibility of our platform. At the same time, we further enhanced the advisor experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention remained solid at 98% in the first quarter and Net Promoter Scores increased year-over-year. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost. Let's now turn to the progress we have made executing our strategic plan. As a reminder, we have evolved our long-term vision. We aspire to expand beyond our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time, and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor centered marketplace. Now our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to use with the flexibility to construct the perfect practice for themselves and their clients. This approach breaks down the walls between traditional market segments and instead focuses on creating total empowerment for LPL advisors to thrive and that is the heart of our mission. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practice. By winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but to also increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets, while overall industry advisor movement remained at lower levels in the first quarter, we continue to gain share and grow our pipeline. Looking more specifically at the regional bank segment of our financial institution channel, we onboarded BMO Harris Financial Advisors in late March. We continue to prepare for M&T to join in the next few months and we advanced conversations with additional prospects. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building in our new affiliation models. Earlier this month, we onboarded two new practices to Strategic Wealth Services, bringing us to a total of seven on the platform. And earlier this week, we added another advisor to our employee-based model. Looking ahead, we feel good about our pipeline for both of these models. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a complement to organic growth. With respect to our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business, we now have commitments from Waddell & Reed advisors who serve approximately 95% of client assets. We are engaging closely with these advisors to help them prepare to transition to LPL and begin leveraging our platform to serve their clients and grow their businesses. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is enriching the end client experience. Advisory platforms are increasingly at the center of the end-client experience as the secular trend toward advisory continues in our business and across the industry. Given this, we remain focused on providing our advisors with an industry-leading advisory platform, including a number of recent enhancements. Within the quarter, we introduced simplified pricing and lowered account minimums on our centrally managed platforms. We also expanded our no-transaction-fee ETF product offering, which now serves about 40% of ETF assets in advisory accounts. At the same time, we are introducing new platform capabilities in the spirit of creating a differentiated UMA offering that combines multiple centrally managed portfolios within a single account. These enhancements increase the appeal, accessibility and flexibility of our advisory offering, which in turn supports our advisors' efforts to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients and that, in turn, helps drive advisor retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel client care model that provides our advisors with differentiated service. In Q1, we completed the rollout of live chat as a complement to our voice channel. Advisors now have a choice of either voice or chat to efficiently connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Our next step is completing the rollout of our digital self-service experience, which, together with voice and chat will position advisors to access industry-leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations. In Q1, our area of focus included enhancing the administrative support around tax season, digitizing forms and automating account transfers. Enhancements in these areas are helping strengthen the advisor experience and the scalability of our platform as our business grows. By remaining focused on the transformation of our service model into a client care model and continuous improvement through the automation and streamlining of our service operations, we believe we are making positive contributions to the service experience, advisor retention and Net Promoter Scores. Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which help advisors operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. As we discussed last quarter, we see several pathways for continued business solutions growth, including partnering with more of our advisors, introducing new solutions to the portfolio and experimenting with serving advisors outside LPL. In the first quarter, our subscription base continued to scale to about 1,700 monthly subscriptions, that generated annualized revenue of approximately $19 million. This growth was primarily driven by our ongoing expansion and evolution of the value proposition of our existing portfolio. Looking at our product road map, we continue to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions, while expanding into new offerings. In Q1, we launched M&A solutions, which is generating solid demand, including over 50 advisors who are leveraging this offering today. In Q2, we plan to introduce our seventh business solution, Client Engage. Now this is -- this evolved from our existing marketing offering and is focused on providing advisors with a digital approach to effectively and efficiently stay connected with their clients. As we look outside LPL, we plan to begin marketing M&A solutions later this year. By experimenting with this scalable technology-driven solution, we can efficiently learn from serving outside advisors, while continuing to focus our resources and investments on delivering business solutions to LPL advisors. Now before closing, I also want to highlight that we released our 2021 sustainability report last week. We believe operating a sustainable business is good for all of our stakeholders. We hope this report provides helpful insight into our practices and performance. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. And as a reminder, we just launched these last year, SWS in April and then the employee model in the second half of last year. And as you know, it takes a bit of positioning in the marketplace, seasoning, iterating on your value proposition as you learn and you get feedback, bringing on clients and then having a good experience and being able to use them as a reference to future prospects and considerations. We've also continued to invest and enhance in the talent on our business development team. So a combination of those things are driving a bigger pipeline, better positioning out in the marketplace from a competitive standpoint, building on existing clients who are having a good experience and then finally using that quality talent to ultimately help go execute. So that's a similar concept for both. SWS, or Strategic Wealth Services, is a bit ahead of the independent employee model only because it started several months earlier, but you can see them on a similar trajectory. I hope that helps. Yes. So Steven, it's Dan. So look, I think we continue to see M&A from a strategy standpoint as a complement to our organic growth and as you know, we look across the lens of growth opportunities or acceleration of capabilities. And so that hasn't changed in our overall strategy. We do believe that if we're good at executing on these transactions, then that becomes an interesting differentiator and an opportunity for us in terms of how we might structure a deal, value a deal, etc. And so we are staying disciplined on making sure with every acquisition that we learned from those and we apply those insights and learnings such that we can execute better the next time. If you look at the drivers of the difference in these two transactions, I think most of it were activities that we control or drive, where we maybe didn't do them as well back in 2017, '18 and we did them much better today. Things like being able to automate and streamline the transition of asset and advisors moving from one place to the next. You take the friction out and help them continue to focus on their clients, that's a pretty appealing scenario. Our ability to take a strategy and go deliver it in a simple articulate manner to help advisors understand what that experience would be like, what their structure, what their economics will be like on the other side of that transaction and do it at pace and clear, you begin to create the right dialogues very quickly that lead to good outcomes. And so those are things that as examples that we continue to learn and evolve and get better in terms of our ability to execute. So as we go forward, to your point, do we think there's continued consolidation, both in what I might call the smaller transactions across the entire spectrum, the larger transactions? Yes. Would we continue to have an opening and exploring and potentially participating in some of that consolidation? I think based on our strategy, the absolute answer would be yes. And to the extent that we get better and better at executing on these, we will use that insight perspective and advantage to think about how we consider approaching them. Yes. Steven, it's great observation in that you did see solid growth in centrally managed platforms. And you're continuing to see that underlying strong baseline growth and utilization of that platform increase, right? So that didn't change in the first quarter across our entire platform. And as we invest and add capabilities, investment content, lower price, we think those centrally managed solutions only become that much more appealing. And then you complement that or add that to, in this case, BMO's utilization of centrally managed solutions and that creates a really interesting opportunity not only for us to think about how we expand and grow our centrally managed platform, but even unique capabilities, we may put inside of it that are helpful and supportive of large institutions. And then all the way finally to large institutions or users of models-based approach and our robust centrally managed solution with MWP enables them to leverage both the growing momentum their advisors have in this space, the great talent they have to serve and support their clients, matched with a platform that is really well aligned with their needs and the way they serve their clients. And that is a pretty interesting formula that certainly drives higher ROA with the more advisory they do and then the utilization of those centrally managed platforms. Today, BMO's business is about one-third advisory, two-third brokerage. So as we go forward, we think our platform is a nice tool and a leverage point to help them as they evolve their business in order to serve their clients in the best way possible. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. As you say, if you look back historically, three years, you saw more of a retention rate in the 96% range. We saw -- if you look over the last 12 months, a retention range in the 97.5% level. So as you've said, we've seen some good stability in that 97% to 98% range for the better part of the last three quarters, which would indicate there's good staying power beyond the pandemic as you return to what I might call normal movement of advisors in the marketplace. And so we're encouraged by that. We continue to invest in the model to improve that service experience, expand the capabilities and deliver those to our advisors such that it helps support them operate an efficient practice and effective practice, serve their clients and grow their business, and you would expect retention rates to be pretty sticky. For us, we're trying to manage in that 97% to 98% range and think that's a pretty good solid outcome and a good sustainable place to operate in if we're doing our job of investing in our model, ensuring it's delivering the right value for our clients. You want to take the economics on the first half, and I'll get the second. Yes. And maybe to build on your product road map question, as we look at our different options and alternatives to expand the portfolio and thus reach either more LPL advisors and/or sell existing advisors additional services, this, again, is based on the premise that they are engaging in many of these services at a local level. So our concept is we can offer them at a higher quality and perhaps at a cheaper cost, a pretty appealing combination. And so if you think about our road map today, you've got the original three offerings, which were admin solution, a CFO solution and a marketing solution. So what we're doing with each one of those is we're exploring, can we create new variations of those offerings, of which might have a narrower value proposition, a lower price point and solve a specific problem or challenge that an advisor has to address on a weekly, monthly reoccurring basis. And so we are working inside our product portfolio across that entire spectrum of offerings to come up with new iterations on that. And you'll see a couple under the CFO solution, one that we're about to begin to go to pilot in Q2 that I mentioned earlier, and that was a derivative of our marketing solutions. And so that's kind of innovation area number one of the road map. The second one is we continue to experiment with new capabilities or new solutions. A great example of that would be experimenting with paraplanning, if you will. A whole new offering with respect to the professional services portfolio, but one that we're testing right now out in the marketplace, learning, iterating and potentially will become a whole new solution, if you will, to that portfolio. So that would be an example of a new solution. M&A solution would fit into that category of new offerings. And so those are the two primary places that we tend to explore, how do we expand the product road map and thus create more and more value that our advisors can leverage to replace that spend that we estimate is close to $1.5 billion a year that they spend on local level services. So that's what's driving that road map. I hope that helps. Yes, it's a great question. And I think it goes back to the start of our mission, right? We got to take care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients, which means we've got to make sure that we're there for them day in, day out from a service experience standpoint, that our platform has the stability necessary to leverage it and utilize it and then ultimately we're providing them the capabilities to create efficient workflows and capabilities to help them differentiate with their clients and continue to win. And we've got to make sure that we give them the tools necessary to pivot their businesses into a multichannel service business, where it's no longer just in person. They got to do it in a combined digital and in-person way. So there's a tremendous opportunity for this platform to show up and support and help them and add value every single day, and that comes first and foremost for them. So our -- we've got to be diligent around making sure that we understand and plan for that growth, well, that we've got the technology and engineering capabilities of which to build the tools that are necessary and scale the platform. We've got to make sure that we've got the fine-tuning, the testing, the utilization of AI to help us with respect to the risk management of our overall platform and stability, privacy, etc., associated with it. So that operating muscle to be really strong to execute on our plan comes first and foremost for us. I'd love to tell you we're perfect at it. We also have to have the humility to constantly listen to feedback. And if we're not getting something right to quickly focus on addressing it and iterating and then ultimately getting better because of it. And so I think that's a principle and the foundation of how we operate and execute. Then we got to make sure that we're investing in the right people, attracting the right talent that we've got the right size talent that is well aligned and positioned to collaborate and execute together to deliver on our expectations. So that comes number two, what are our operating metrics, how do we observe, measure, how we operate not on a weekly or a monthly basis, but on a daily basis. So it's that we can take that data, learn from it, fine-tune, revise, iterate, etc, to make sure that we can be the best that we can be every day. And then finally, we got to be investing in technology and automation that helps us scale. So you can scale into bursts of growth or you can constantly with consistent sustainable growth that you are constantly improving and enhancing your performance because you're able to digitize and automate it from end to end throughout the ecosystem, not to mention the benefits that you get from a scalability from an economic standpoint by doing that. So we continue to work on that. Introducing robotics, deploying AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem in order to do that. And so we've got a lot of passion for doing it. We're not perfect. We hold ourselves uber accountable to our NPS scores. We've got room to improve, and it's priority one for the firm. I hope that helps. I think that's great strategic utility. And I think that is a good hypothesis and a premise that we are seeing trend once someone is engaged in a service, if they're having good success and it's a good leverage point, there's a higher propensity to use another one. I think as we iterate on the portfolio and expand the different offerings and you create, as an example, not just a holistic CFO offering, but you can take elements of what a CFO's role might be, bookkeeping as an example, or FP&A work, and you're able to create discrete products out of things like that. I think your premise of sort of a land-and-expand strategy makes even more sense. And so there's more to play out on that as we evolve our product road map. But we are trying to also be digital first and use data of which to learn and understand how our clients are engaging with us, both so that we can improve our offering, better -- deliver a better service experience to them across this portfolio. It's a good question. Dan H. Arnold -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. In that maybe one helpful comment. Relative to your gross profit point because this is an acquisition, the ramp of the advisors is different than a normal recruiting scenario. So the assets and the advisors will all come over in mass. So let's say, we close tomorrow, let's just say, three months later, the assets come over a weekend and the advisors come over a weekend. And so they will be all on our platform. So your ability to begin ramping from that point is solid and a little different from recruiting where you ramp in over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. No, there's a lot there. So let me give you a directional answer of that, just I think to give you some guideposts and in some places, not to try to be overly precise on something we don't exactly know, right? So with respect to recruiting, your first part of your question, I think the short answer is it does not go back to what it was before, but it doesn't necessarily stay what it is today. And I do believe that we've continued to recruit throughout. We've had some people doing some travel throughout. We've been incurring some expense relative to our business development activities, right, the sort of the core G&A expenses associated with that. But we have used technology and learn to use technology in a much, much more creative way, and we've broken through and set new paradigms, if you will, on how to do that in acceptable ways to do that and gotten better at it over the years. So I actually think you'll see a mix where we'll use technology where it's more efficient, it's less wear and tear. And quite frankly, it's more appealing for the advisors or the prospect as well as for our business development resources as an example. And then where we do need to travel and where we do make a difference in face-to-face, we will absolutely do that. So if we do this well, we should find both improved efficiency and efficacy in our business development efforts. So that's how I would answer that one. Again, not trying to be really precise about exactly where the dial goes back to. But I think it's some middle ground. I hope that was helpful to you on the recruiting. On -- with respect to our advisors, a couple of things. Their baselines changed significantly in the first 90 days when the country shut down. But the pace of reopening, as you know, has been very, very different at a local level across the country. And many of our advisors are doing a lot more face-to-face than what we might -- would expect living in bigger cities. And so consequently, I think you've already seen a pivot for a lot of advisors, probably more back to that baseline way they did business. But I think the cool part about our advisors being in businesses for themselves, they've got to be quite innovative and have that entrepreneurial spirit, right, of a small business owner. And most have added this digital capability to their repertoire. So now they've got two ways of which to serve clients, which again, opens up the aperture of their opportunity to increase the size of their book, find more efficient ways to engage with clients, and then ultimately provide a mix of those that would rather meet in person versus those that are good doing it over the video. And you now redefine geography for them by doing that as well. And so we actually think this becomes a really interesting opportunity for our advisors as a catalyst to enhance the service experience, expand the flexibility around it and ultimately use that as a catalyst for growth. Do I think they're going to get back to doing dinners full time like they used to? No, but I do think that dial will go back to what is -- how that advisor uniquely wants to run their practice. So you'll see probably a spectrum of different outcomes depending on the advisor themselves and their clients. I'll stop there. Yes. Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Stay safe."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2022, our advisers remain the source of support and guidance for their clients against the backdrop of increased market volatility. In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and the important role they play for their clients. We thank them for their continued commitment and dedication as we focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their client. With respect to our performance, our fourth quarter business results drove a solid financial outlook, while at the same time, we continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $21 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to net new assets for the year of $96 billion, also representing an 8% organic growth. Recruited assets were $15 billion Q4, bringing our total for the full year to $82 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination which drove solid same-store sales in the fourth quarter. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention for the fourth quarter and full year was approximately 98%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.21 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $11.52, an increase of 64% from a year ago. Now let's turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business.  Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions to help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experience to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts the extraordinary business.  Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business, by winning in our traditional markets, also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our addressable market. In our traditional markets, ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team led to continued improvement to our win rates and an expansion of the depth and breadth of our despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.  As a result, Q4 was our strongest quarter of recruiting in 2022 in our traditional markets with approximately $11 billion in assets. looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q1. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $1 billion in assets in Q4. In each of these models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions for our organic growth. With respect to large enterprises, they remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2022, including the additions of CUNA and People's United. Looking ahead, we expect to onboard Commerce Bank around the middle of this year and continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. And at the same time, we continue to have success recruiting in our traditional enterprise channel, including the addition of bank for [indiscernible] South in Q4. Within this strategic play, we are also seeing positive early momentum with our most recent innovation of liquidity and succession capability where we are providing a differentiated offer to meet succession needs of the advisers. Over the next decade, it is estimated that up to 1/3 of advisers will be retired and will likely address succession needs of their practices. To solve for this need, our first innovation was providing M&A support service to help facilitate the transition of practices from adviser to advisory. Our key learnings from that experience, there are many instances due to factors like large practice size or lack of an identified successor that will require a different solution.  And without of this need, we created our differentiated liquidity and succession offering, which LPL will step in to purchase an adviser's business and serve as a bridge to the next entrepreneurial successor, all while preserving the principles of independent. The offering has been well received and we are encouraged our early momentum, having already executed on a handful of transactions with providers on our product. This year, we will also plan to take the capability to the external marketplace and look forward to sharing our progress. Our second strategic play is to provide capability to help our advisers differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency in the back. In 2023, we will focus our development of new capabilities and solutions within this play across four key areas. First, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients to differentiated advice, products and pricing.  Second, we will continue to advance ClientWorks, our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more fun. Third, we will expand our banking and lending services to help advisers address a broader spectrum of the clients' financial needs and thus deepen their role as an essential partner.  And the final area is to enrich the end client experience with additional digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention. Now let's move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention.  As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an omnichannel client care model, including voice, chat and digital support.  And as part of this journey, we have evolved the technology and instrumentation of our traditional voice channel while also making meaningful enhancements to our always- on digital support capabilities. As a result, approximately 75% of engagements with our digital channel fully resolve the service request and don't necessitate a phone call to complete the task. As we continue to expand and refine our digital support channel, we believe that an increasing share of advisers will leverage digital-first support for more flexible and efficient service experience. As we continue to evolve our service interface, we're also transforming the operational processing that takes place behind that interface. For example, last year, we began automating much of the processing for our core clearing, including money movement, account opening and account transfer, which collectively drive the majority of our operational process.  And with these learnings from our transformation and service and operations, we are reengineering other areas of the business, including our compliance and risk management. Out of that end, we've applied robotics and AI capabilities through a number of our compliance review workloads, which has improved both the efficiency of the reviews as well as the efficacy of the overall risk management.  Efforts on this front include automating the reviews of client communications, marketing materials and transactions. Now by automating more workflows, we continue to increase the scalability of our platform while also enhancing plan is good. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from driving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their client. As we discussed last quarter, we are encouraged by the seasoning of this business and the evolving appeal of our value proposition.  As a result of solid demand, in Q4, the number of advisers utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the year at over 3,000 active users, up more than 30% year-over-year and generating run rate revenue of $36 million. Now when we started our services group, we focused on addressing some of the most complex challenges facing our advisers. We were often more acute for advisers with larger practices. With the insights and learnings from this initial client segment, we're now expanding our service portfolio to address the needs of a broader adviser base. As we continue to evolve the offering in 2023, we are focused on several key opportunities for our services group: first, addressing additional channels, specifically building solutions solve for needs of enterprises; second, leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to continue to develop new services and evolve our existing portfolio; and third, contributing to the growth of our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth and Linsco, as well as expanding our ability to serve high net worth. So, in summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2022. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisers and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities.  We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients, developed and piloted our new liquidity and succession capability and announced two strategic acquisitions. We accomplished this all while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record earnings per share. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, up 7% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total net new assets were $21 billion or an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $15 billion. I would note, this included $11 billion from our traditional independent model, which was the highest quarter of the year. Looking ahead to Q1, our overall pipelines continue to remain strong. In particular, I would highlight that within our traditional models, the momentum we saw in Q4 has continued into Q1, and we are on pace to deliver one of our strongest first quarters in what is typically our slowest quarter of the year. As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $4.21, the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $972 million, up $135 million or 16% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $172 million, down $10 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production mode.  In Q4, our payout rate was 88.4%, up about 50 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production model. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 87% as the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, up $136 million from Q3 as the impact of higher short- term interest rates more than offset a sequential decline in balances. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $64 billion, down $3 billion driven by record net buying of $25 billion. Within our ICA  [Technical Difficulty]  As for Q1, we expect our ICA yield to increase to approximately 315 basis points, which include yesterday's 25 basis point hike at an assumed deposit beta of 25%. As for service and fee revenue, it was $120 million in Q4, down $2 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference revenue, following our largest adviser conference of the year in Q3. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect typical seasonal increases in IRA to be offset by lower comp charge, so we anticipate service and fee revenue to be roughly flat to Q4. Regarding Q4 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $4 million sequentially as trading volume increased. Based on what we have seen in Q1 to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be roughly flat with Q4. Turning to expenses. Our core G&A was $327 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.192 billion. This was in the middle of our outlook range and, for the full year, represents approximately 13% growth. As for our outlook for 2023, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We plan to continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage in our core business. As we shared at our Investor and Analyst Day, the current environment is creating opportunities to accelerate our investment plans. As such, we expect to grow our investments at a similar pace this year. More specifically, we plan to grow our 2023 core G&A in the range of 12% to 15%. To share a little more color on where our investments are focused, this expense growth spans the following three broad categories, with each driving approximately 4% to 5% growth in core G&A. First, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities. second, to support growth in our expanded addressable market and to scale our new services. and third, to accelerate the timing of investments that advance our strategy. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of this spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $320 million to $325 million. As always, we will remain flexible and can adjust to shifts in the operating. Turning to promotional expense. In Q4, it was $84 million, down $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference spend. In Q1, we expect promotional expense will increase by approximately $25 million as we have two of our largest conferences of the year during the quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $12 million in Q4, up $1 million from Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $5 million sequentially in Q1 as it tends to be our highest quarter of the year given the timing of our annual stock awards. As for interest expense, it was $37 million in Q4 and up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating rate debt. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $459 million, up $35 million from Q3. Our leverage ratio was 1.4 time, down from 1.7 time in Q3. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth in a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power.  As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth, first and foremost, pursuing M&A, where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. As we look ahead to 2023, the strength of our balance sheet leaves us with ample capacity to allocate capital across our entire framework. Specific to organic growth, we see opportunities in recruiting and continued investment in our technology platform. On M&A, we see opportunities in the succession offering where we are emerging from the pilot phase and closed four deals in 2022 for around $50 million. With regards to capital return, we plan to increase our share repurchases to roughly $250 million in Q1. And lastly, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 20% beginning in Q1. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi, guys. thanks for the question. So, Matt, maybe we can start with the question around just the cash dynamics. Obviously, it's an area that creates a lot of anxiety for investors still. Maybe talk a little bit about dynamics you saw in December that kind of let the balances being a little bit better than we saw with some of the peers, what you're seeing so far in January and then, importantly, the demand from the bank channel given that the fixed extensions you highlighted in the deck seemed pretty robust. So maybe kind of walk us through the current environment and cash.\nMatthew Audette: Yes, sure, Alex. So, I think in December, we saw the typical seasonal build that you see from tax loss harvesting and rebalancing. And I think as you pull that forward into what we're seeing in January, that cash typically goes back into the marketplace.  So that $1.6 billion or so that we saw a build in December in January naturally went back into the market. I'd also highlight, from a seasonality standpoint, advisory fees for the three months of the quarter, the first quarter of the month, as I think you know well, is typically the highest month for advisory fees, and those are about $1 billion in the month of January. So, if you just look from a seasonal standpoint, you'd have a decline of around $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion in the month. And then in addition to that and just commenting on the overall market activity, we have seen just broad adviser and investor reengagement in the marketplace. I think a good way to summarize that is our customer net buying metric. The highest month -- if you look at our monthly metrics, the highest month we've ever had was back in August of 2022 at $10 billion for the month.  For January, what we're seeing is just north of $11 billion, so the strongest engagement that we've had. And that money is really going back into the equity markets and, as you may expect, longer-dated fixed income securities and things like that. So that's naturally going to drive down balances when you pull those seasonal factors, and combined with the investment engagement, we expect January cash sweep to be around $60 billion -- in the $60 billion. I think specific to the -- I think the third question, the last part of your question, on the market for ICA contracts. The headline I'd give you is it continues to improve throughout 2022, continued to improve in Q4 and maybe break it up into two buckets. The market for the floating rate balances, the demand continues to be well in excess of the deposits that we have, and you're starting to see that lead to price improvement.  So, for the contracts that we're putting from a floating rate standpoint now, they're more fed funds plus 10 or 15 as opposed to last quarter, they were plus five to 10 and then back in the heart of the pandemic, if we could place them at all, it was fed funds flat to down. So, the market there is quite good. On the fixed rate side, we're able to add $4 billion in balances this quarter ranging from two to six years. And I think when you combine that with the progress in the past few quarters, we're now not at our high but starting to get close to the high that we've had from a percent of the portfolio at 45%.  And when we look ahead to Q1, we've got $2 billion of maturities coming up. And I think we feel quite good about being able to place those into new fixed rate agreements and, even beyond that, starting to be able to continue to grow the portfolio overall, just seeing the overall demand.  So, headline, I'd say from my side, Alex, is pretty good.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. And maybe just a second question around the balance sheet. It's nice to see the leverage come down now below your guidance target, which I think you guys revisited recently to lower that. So, as you think about priorities between building out the lending practice, perhaps inorganic opportunities and maybe accelerating some of the share repurchases, how would you think about that?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Well, I think, Alex, the key point on the lending side is it's not a big use of the balance sheet. So, it's really more about connecting the capabilities so our clients can use that. I think on the buyback, I think just going back to our overall capital allocation framework, I think we're focused on investing in organic growth first, M&A second and capital returns third.  And I think from a pace of the buyback, it would just all depend upon the opportunities that we see. So, if the opportunities to invest in organic growth weren't there or M&A wasn't as strong as we would expect, I think that's a scenario where we could accelerate buyback. And then the opposite is also true. We can slow it down if opportunities would lead there. So, the key for us is really to be flexible. And maybe I'd just reiterate that our center of gravity is really that $250 million.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thank you, Matthew.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon Dan, good afternoon Matt. So, I really appreciated the additional granularity in terms of the expense guidance. Your prior expense guide was 15% growth in '23. This latest update appears better or at least a tighter range of 12% to 15%. Is that the right way to interpret the guidance, a bit better than what you offered up last time? And just looking beyond '23 and thinking about that longer-term expense growth algorithm, is there anything we can infer from those buckets that you offered as to what's a normal pace of expense growth, say, in a period where you're not accelerating your investment plans?\nMatthew Audette: Yes, Steve. I think on our plans, I mean they really -- they didn't change at all from Investor Day. I think the key is we gave our preliminary thinking there and really went through our typical year-end process to finalize those plans. And I think that's where the 12% to 15% comes from. So, I think the strategy that we have of using this environment really to advance our investments is just the same, and you're just seeing us now land the plane with a sharper pencil. I think specific to the three categories, I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is informative. I think when you look at the investments to support our core business growth, right, assuming that growth is continuing, I think that level of 4% to 5% supports that growth.  When you look at the second and third categories, by definition, that's where we have flexibility. And we can adjust those based on the market and whether there's opportunity to spend in those areas or not, especially that third category where it's all about advancing things that we may have otherwise done in '24 and beyond that we're now going to do in '23.\nSteven Chubak: And just for my follow-up on organic growth, certainly encouraging to hear that the NNA momentum in 4Q has continued to start the year. I was hoping you could just speak to some of the factors that's driving that better NNA momentum? Just trying to gauge how much is environmental, so the strength in the markets, maybe increasing advisers in motion versus more idiosyncratic.  And you were talking about the pipeline strength in institutional as well in your NNA remarks, how much of that strength is coming from larger institutions?\nDan Arnold: So, let me take that one, Steven. There's a lot there, so if I missed something, you give me guidance after I finish. So, Look, I think if we start as a jump-off point, last year, 80% organic growth rate, $96 billion in NNA, which is a pretty solid outcome against a challenging macro backdrop.  And I think irrespective of that backdrop, I think making the progress or working through sort of that environment, both in terms of our teams and advisers, you just continue to evolve capabilities, skills and operating in any potential environment. So, I think as we look forward and we think about going forward, we feel good that the sort of the acclamation to an upper macro, if it sustains itself, that we can execute in it better and ultimately contribute improved or better growth. So that's how I would sort of think about the environmental. It may influence what I might call short- term progress around our growth ethics.  I think, probably more importantly, strategically, as we think about our opportunity those drivers of that strategy, right, those significant structural, big durable trends all remain in place. It's growing demand for advice. The appeal of receiving that advice through a financial professional, the attractiveness of the independent model versus other models all continue.  And I think we sit at the intersection of all of those and believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. And whether that's through our market leadership, singular focus on what we do, robust platform of which to leverage and use and differentiate or even the capacity and commitment to invest, but that was just speaking of to evolve platform and continue to differentiate it. So, I think as we think about going forward, that comes up to that 7% to 13% sort of growth rates that we talked about across different macro environments, I think, is still highly relevant, still how we think about it. And I think last year demonstrated the ability to persevere through a tougher macro and still reside within that range. So that's how we think about the shorter run and the longer run. I think to your click down on the enterprises within that, look, it's a channel that we've talked about is a durable growth contributor. We've continued to evolve our capability set with more wins and with good success with those relationships, create better advocacy from our clients and that IP and insight from being on the court for a couple of years working on those large enterprises is certainly IP that's hard to replicate without that experience itself.  And so, when we look at that going forward, it's a pretty appealing model that is finding a marketplace that is in need of that type of model, and we're pretty convicted around our solution. So, we do believe that, again, within those bookends of 7% to 13%, we do get some contribution from large enterprise. So, I hope that gives you a little color.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks, for taking my question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Unfortunately, my connection cut out a little bit, Matt, while you're talking a little bit about the ICA dynamics. I guess my broader question is, as you think about what's been happening in the forward market and expectations softening up a little bit, how is that informing the opportunity here to potentially accelerate the ratio of fixing out relative to the float? And then you mentioned that demand is very healthy. How should we be thinking about reinvestment rate opportunity?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I think, Bill, our perspective on fixed rates really to get into that target range we have of 50% to 75%. And I think the -- if you cut out while I was commenting, I think the comment on the market is it continues to improve, right? It's not perfect, right? We can't move exactly where we want. But I think if you look at the trends throughout 2022 and as we look ahead into what we're seeing already in Q1, demand continues to improve.  So, I think we feel good about the maturities that we knew fixed rate agreements. You can see what we did in Q4 that we're targeting to go out in the five and even, in some cases, a six-year zone based on what the market will bear. And then when you look at the demand overall, in addition to those maturities, I think we feel like we've got the opportunity to grow it in some amount from there.  so, the headline is the marketplace is strong. And I think with where the curve is, we still think it makes sense to target getting into that range if the market will allow us to do so.\nWilliam Katz: Terrific. And then just going back to expenses, again, I apologize my connection just cut out. Of the variability to this sort of more refined 12% to 15% and sort of bringing forward that growth, should we be interpreting that, as we look out into '24, all else being equal, that the absolute level of this growth rate would decelerate? Or might you be in the same kind of situation where you would have the opportunity here to sort of advance your organic growth? And is it really now a point of trade-off between organic growth and margin as you think about the business?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean I think when you get to our long-term cost strategy, Bill, where that fourth principle is really adjusting our cost to the market, right, so I think, as you may expect, we'll make judgments about 2024 as we get closer to that year. But I would emphasize from an optionality standpoint, when you look at that third category of 4% to 5%, that is opportunistic. The market, especially for 2023 with the interest rate benefits that we have, allow us to make those investments.  And you can look at our op margins with the tailwind of interest rates or op margins continuing to be quite strong, we're in a good place to do that. If the market does not allow us to do that, we've got the ability to adjust. So, I think I would definitely take away that we've got the flexibility. And when you start to look beyond 2023, we'll make those judgments as we get closer to that time period.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your question please.\nDevin Ryan: Hi, thanks. Dan, Matt. I guess first question, as we think about the opportunity to move upstream with larger advisers and higher net worth over time here, what are the capabilities that you need to add to be able to do that? Do you have everything you need and just kind of investing and improving? Or are there other types of capabilities that are maybe incorporated in some of that expense growth that are coming that could really help accelerate that push?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Devin, it's Dan. So, look, as we think about the opportunity set in the high net worth space, and I speak now of the end client segment when I refer to high net worth, that's a function of our advisers' overall evolving practices. And as they have clients or more clients that they have an opportunity to serve inside that category, that's really driven the demand for services and capabilities that traditionally may not have sat inside our overall sweet spot. And so, I think that's been the real catalyst for the driver of our contemplation of building out certain capabilities. And so, examples of that are us building out our own service around complex case design, right? And so that would be an investment that shows up in the core G&A reference that Matt was making, as an example, to your question. I think you also see that in extended financial planning support. It's not just the technology, but it's the Paraplanning services that sit around it, as an example. So those are things that we're building ourselves or organic capabilities that we're building ourselves. So, as we've gone on the journey, we will -- we have built and we'll continue to build certain things that are in-house. There's also other things that we think are important to serve high net worth types of clients, maybe that's tailored insurance offerings that we traditionally haven't done inside our own insurance agency or services like helping to sell a small or midsized business.  And that's where we'll -- we are developing strategic partnerships of which to provide those integrated solutions and services inside our overall offering rather than building. And so that's how we're putting together what we think is a compelling set of solutions that position our advisers to serve and support their high net worth clients. Now as we built out those capabilities or we're in the progress of, it also challenges us then to say, well, how do we better deploy those to the marketplace or leverage those, if you will. And I think that's where we realized with the capability set that we have today, could we utilize that to even target what I might call advisers who specifically operate with only high net worth clients.  And I think that would be an example of how we better leverage these capabilities, and that's something we continue to explore in terms of how we go to market with this capability. But think about it that way, is we're building some of these capabilities. We've been on a journey, we're not completely there, but we've made some significant progress.  And then we'll look to the outside market strategic partnerships. And I'm doing that, I think we can take the capital-light model to what is a compelling value proposition, use it to support our existing advisers and help us potentially attract new.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great context, thanks Dan. Just a quick follow-up here on kind of the M&A market and conditions. You sounded reasonably optimistic around what you're seeing now. There was a big wealth manager or deal in the wealth management space announced today.  I guess just what are some of the themes that you're seeing in the market that is kind of the catalyst for activity? I'm not sure if it's the same across channels, but any context around maybe what's making you feel like it's a reasonable M&A market right now.\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think we'll continue to see that ongoing trend around consolidation. I think you're continuing to see innovation around capabilities as well, and so that leads to transactions around a certain type of IP or capability set that firms may want to deploy or utilize in a different way.  And then we're seeing more robust activity around solving for succession planning at the individual adviser level and/or smaller practices level. And so, I think you're seeing a healthy amount of activity across the ecosystem. We continue to stay active in exploring all of those possibilities, right? And you see us deploying capital, as an example, the closings we did yesterday with Boenning & Scattergood and FRGIS.  I would just remind you our framework for exploring those possibilities, and you know these, first, it's in sort of side that what I would call growth opportunities in traditional markets where we see opportunity for purposes of growth to potentially acquire a practice, and Boenning & Scattergood would be a great example of that, what would be a great example of that. We also look in that second category where we can add capabilities faster through an acquisition than building them ourselves. We believe we've got to stay open and agile and nimble around that framework. And then the final one, the third one, which is a little newer one and is aligned with this new capability of liquidity and succession, is putting capital work through acquiring these practices and being that bridge to that future successors. So, I think that's where we're active, that's where we're exploring potential possibilities. And we see pretty good activity going on in the consumer market.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good afternoon Dan and Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on -- just to kind of zoom out a little bit and touch on the pricing trends you're seeing in your business. I guess just given the environment we're all operating in, I mean, are there some areas where you're looking to either take price or actually invest in price as you look ahead given all the different initiatives that you're dealing out there with the business?\nDan Arnold : Yes, Michael, I'll take that one, and certainly, Matt, you add anything you want at the end. Look, we look at pricing as above our overall offering. Think about such capability, services, technology. We look at pricing as part of our overall investment strategy, if you will. And I think as we shared in the past, we've created a reoccurring theme of investing back into the platform, specifically trying to use price to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. And so I think that places that we've been historically focused on for the past, call it, four to five years has been typically around the advisory platform, right, 70%, 75% of new assets -- sorry, yes, new cash is going to those types of solutions, and we want to make sure that we're enriching the appeal of them. And so as we look at 2023, you'll see us continue to lower pricing around our centrally managed platforms as a way to create more applications for advisers to leveraging middle all of those, refined with the enriched capability set that we're adding to them, more and more using them versus that was the type of purchase.  You're also seeing us look at transaction charges in certain areas where we're being very tactical around that. Although this holistic sort of lowering of transaction, we're trying to be very tactical about where we make those changes, such that we actually make the adjustments on where they make the most sense for our advisers that ultimately help them. And so I think those are a couple of examples that we'll continue to pursue this year. So whatever we can do that we think is optimal to help our advisers differentiate and win in the places that matters most of them is what we're trying to solve for. Those are a couple. I hope that helps.\nMichael Cho : Yes, it does. I appreciate the color. And then just one quick follow-up. Dan, I think you kind of referenced this just on the expenses. Just looking at the third bucket of expenses where we're talking about the accelerated portion. I guess, are there areas you'd call out that's going to receive those accelerated investments?\nMatthew Audette : Yes, this is Matt. I'll take that one. I think there's -- when you think about that third bucket, it's more about the timing of the investments. So there's no specific category. I think you go back to the investments that we're making in technology and capabilities that help improve our value proposition or help support and open up our expanded markets. And when you think about those plans, we've got multiyear plans on the things that we think are quite important. And that third bucket is really about, given the environment that we're in, accelerating some of those plans. So that's the headline there. I don't know, Dan, if there's anything you want to add.\nDan Arnold: I would just give you an additional way to frame that. If you remember back at the Investor and Analyst Day that we did, we shared the framework around vertical integration and a lot of those investments are showing off that spectrum of opportunities that we have. So as we drive more and more solutions into sort of that lower in the ecosystem where it really helps the adviser operate at a local level, but you'll find it also coming all the way back to things that enhance our advisory platform. And so I think you're seeing an accelerated investment across that entire spectrum as opposed to any one specific play. So I hope that helps to keep your framework to think about how we think about the spectrum of investments and perhaps how that's been [indiscernible].\nMichael Cho: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate all the color. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question, please. \nKyle Voigt : Hi, good evening. Maybe just another question on centrally managed platforms. You mentioned that, in a response on pricing, the organic net new asset growth there is still strong but it's been decelerating over the past couple of quarters. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the recent trends and then kind of where you see the opportunity to take that penetration rate to over time for the centrally managed business? Thank you.\nDan Arnold : Yes. So obviously, with respect to our advisory platforms, that fits inside that overall spectrum of offering. And as we think about enriching that entire platform, one of the places we've been focused on is centrally managed solutions. And we continue to add more capabilities and more value there. We think about the investment content that's available, the ability for advisers to use that in different ways, really turning that into a UMA and expanding the SMAs that are available on it.  There's really cool enhancements and functionality that is materially improving the appeal and how one would apply it in more scenarios and cases. So we're excited about the potential opportunity and for it to continue to sort of grow share, if you will, in that overall mix of business, both with respect to advisory but we even think about it across a full spectrum of brokerage, because the more appealing we make this even at smaller accounts, where it's appropriate, and people feel that the plan is better served from that movement of brokerage to advisory, a lot of that would tend to move over to centrally managed solution. So that's one way to think about how we add capability to make it more appealing to drive utilization. And I think we believe that upside can be significant, certainly continuing to invest in the pricing helps also drive the appeal and demand for it. And think about, as you think about last year and rightfully so, still good demand but the trend was down.  Historically speaking, centrally managed usually reacts more or is more impacted, if you will, by a challenging macro environment. The more volatility, the more sort of a downward trend in equity markets, and in fact, we had the combination of tough fixed income markets last year, and that's where we'll many times see an adviser sort of more want to put their hands on the wheel and drive that. So you're seeing some of that sort of volatility in the marketplace, the macro marketplace noise occurring in that trend. I think structurally speaking, we continue to invest in the appeal of it. And the more appealing we make it, the more it should drive up utilization on a relevant basis. I hope that helps.\nKyle Voigt: Good. Thank you. And then for a follow-up, maybe just a modeling question here for Matt. The DCA yield came in a bit above our expectation. I know that's formulaic really. But just wondering maybe you could provide an update on the number of accounts that flow into that program currently and how or if that number has grown recently?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean I don't have an update on the number of accounts. I would emphasize, though, I think the point you're making, it is a fee per account. So the -- so we quote it in basis points, but it's a little hard for it to be predictive, just given balances to move up and down. So it's the account, I would emphasize they haven't changed materially. But when you get a pop perhaps like you've seen in this quarter, that may not be something that you would expect to see going forward just because it's not really rate driven, it's fee per account driven.\nKyle Voigt: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Your question, please.\nJeff Schmitt : Thank you. On recruited assets, I'm just curious how the recruiting environment for advisers looks right now. I know you mentioned it is pretty strong for you. But are you seeing any competitors get more aggressive on pricing just with organic growth down for the industry, maybe they're trying to look for growth? \nDan Arnold : Yes. So look, I think the recruiting environment, I think it's well documented over the last three years, the churn in the industry has slowed, right, from 2022 to -- sorry, 2020 to 2022, primarily driven on the backs of the pandemic and then the macro volatility last year, which are pretty extreme impacts. And so certainly, with less sort of swings in the batter's box, I think you have competitors that will tend to respond to that in different ways and some have gotten more aggressive on the transition of systems. That's what we're talking about, about being more aggressive.  And then certainly, when you add to that the rising interest rates that can be more robustly monetized, and thus so in underwriting around deals, you'll see transition systems get more aggressive in those types of environments. And I think it -- logic would have it, that's what would occur, and that's what we've seen over last three years. I think, look, for us, we don't see any changes in the opportunity set. I think the -- as we think about it, the ongoing evolution of our capabilities, the expansion of our market opportunity set with our expanded affiliation models, introduction of our services group, advocacy of existing advisers from good experiences, are really the key drivers of that opportunity set and our ability to drive win rates regardless of what the churn or opportunity set is in the marketplace.  We did see the -- sorry, the market stabilizing more in the third and fourth quarter and more advisers now getting past that volatility and reengaging and exploring their strategic options. And I think to the extent that there's not some big shift in the macro, we continue to expect to see that trend occurring.  And you'll continue to see folks explore that movement from an employee-based model to independent model. We continue to see with more and more capabilities, folks in the independent model, looking for something that can serve and support them better and taking care of their clients. And finally, even with being able to help with their own succession planning creates another catalyst of opportunities.  So I think we think those things are much more important and bigger drivers of the ultimate sort of size of the movement, but certainly in the short run, there's been some noise or in immediate term, pretty extreme scenarios, right, of the macro, given the pandemic and the first equity markets last year since 2008.  I hope that helps give you some color on at least what we're seeing over the recruiting landscape.\nJeff Schmitt: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. And then a question on the brokerage assets organic growth rate up 7% in the quarter. How much of that was driven by bank outsourcing? And I guess, like what deals specifically, any breakdown of that would be helpful.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. So the large financial institutions, that's what you're asking about, on the brokerage assets?\nJeff Schmitt : Yes, right.\nMatthew Audette: Yes, it's relatively minor. I mean the growth rate was 7% for the quarter. Prior to that, it'd be 6.5%. So a relatively minor part of it in the quarter.\nDan Arnold: Maybe to add to that, if you're curious around why the trend or better growth in brokerage over the past three to four quarters, I think that's the evolving interest rate environment and advisers using solutions that may be more brokerage-oriented solutions, whether that be fixed income or whether that be annuities of which to help clients seeking higher yield or higher rates. And so that's where you're seeing some of that growth come from that wasn't necessarily the trend prior to last year. \nJeff Schmitt: Okay, that\u2019s what I have looking for. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your question please. \nGerry O'Hara : Thanks. Maybe one for Matt. The leverage ratio of 1.4 coming down from 1.7, I think you said it kind of continue to grow in a higher interest rate environment. What do you feel is maybe sort of an optimal sort of long-term leverage ratio? I think some peers, both public and private, tend to run at a bit of a higher number. And just sort of want to get a little bit more color as to how you think this might be best set up to optimize the business, I think, kind of in a long-term environment? Thank you.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, I think, is really the leverage ratio that we think makes sense in a range of different economic environments. And I think the ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and have the capacity to invest for growth in a range of different environments, I think, is a key part of our value proposition.  I think it's a key part for our advisers and clients knowing that if the macro moves against us, and we're not at a leverage ratio, we're going to have to immediately pull back on investments or immediately pull back on being able to serve and support them and the host of capabilities that we have, recruiting and succession being an example. So I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, we landed on that with a view that that's the right leverage ratio in a range of environments. And I think it certainly a key part of the value prop that differentiates from some of the firms that you mentioned. And I think where we are today, being at the low end or just below the low end of that, with a fair bit of capital deployment coming our way in Q1, including the acquisitions that we closed, as well as being positioned at that point in a macro that's, I think, anything but certain at this point, I think we like where we're sitting.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. That\u2019s it for me this evening. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thanks much, John, and I just want to thank everyone for taking their valuable time out to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2022. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisers and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities.  We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients, developed and piloted our new liquidity and succession capability and announced two strategic acquisitions. We accomplished this all while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record earnings per share. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, up 7% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total net new assets were $21 billion or an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $15 billion. I would note, this included $11 billion from our traditional independent model, which was the highest quarter of the year. Looking ahead to Q1, our overall pipelines continue to remain strong. In particular, I would highlight that within our traditional models, the momentum we saw in Q4 has continued into Q1, and we are on pace to deliver one of our strongest first quarters in what is typically our slowest quarter of the year. As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $4.21, the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $972 million, up $135 million or 16% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $172 million, down $10 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production mode.  In Q4, our payout rate was 88.4%, up about 50 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production model. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 87% as the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, up $136 million from Q3 as the impact of higher short- term interest rates more than offset a sequential decline in balances. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $64 billion, down $3 billion driven by record net buying of $25 billion. Within our ICA  [Technical Difficulty]  As for Q1, we expect our ICA yield to increase to approximately 315 basis points, which include yesterday's 25 basis point hike at an assumed deposit beta of 25%. As for service and fee revenue, it was $120 million in Q4, down $2 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference revenue, following our largest adviser conference of the year in Q3. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect typical seasonal increases in IRA to be offset by lower comp charge, so we anticipate service and fee revenue to be roughly flat to Q4. Regarding Q4 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $4 million sequentially as trading volume increased. Based on what we have seen in Q1 to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be roughly flat with Q4. Turning to expenses. Our core G&A was $327 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.192 billion. This was in the middle of our outlook range and, for the full year, represents approximately 13% growth. As for our outlook for 2023, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We plan to continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage in our core business. As we shared at our Investor and Analyst Day, the current environment is creating opportunities to accelerate our investment plans. As such, we expect to grow our investments at a similar pace this year. More specifically, we plan to grow our 2023 core G&A in the range of 12% to 15%. To share a little more color on where our investments are focused, this expense growth spans the following three broad categories, with each driving approximately 4% to 5% growth in core G&A. First, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities. second, to support growth in our expanded addressable market and to scale our new services. and third, to accelerate the timing of investments that advance our strategy. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of this spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $320 million to $325 million. As always, we will remain flexible and can adjust to shifts in the operating. Turning to promotional expense. In Q4, it was $84 million, down $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference spend. In Q1, we expect promotional expense will increase by approximately $25 million as we have two of our largest conferences of the year during the quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $12 million in Q4, up $1 million from Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $5 million sequentially in Q1 as it tends to be our highest quarter of the year given the timing of our annual stock awards. As for interest expense, it was $37 million in Q4 and up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating rate debt. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $459 million, up $35 million from Q3. Our leverage ratio was 1.4 time, down from 1.7 time in Q3. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth in a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power.  As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth, first and foremost, pursuing M&A, where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. As we look ahead to 2023, the strength of our balance sheet leaves us with ample capacity to allocate capital across our entire framework. Specific to organic growth, we see opportunities in recruiting and continued investment in our technology platform. On M&A, we see opportunities in the succession offering where we are emerging from the pilot phase and closed four deals in 2022 for around $50 million. With regards to capital return, we plan to increase our share repurchases to roughly $250 million in Q1. And lastly, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 20% beginning in Q1. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes, sure, Alex. So, I think in December, we saw the typical seasonal build that you see from tax loss harvesting and rebalancing. And I think as you pull that forward into what we're seeing in January, that cash typically goes back into the marketplace.  So that $1.6 billion or so that we saw a build in December in January naturally went back into the market. I'd also highlight, from a seasonality standpoint, advisory fees for the three months of the quarter, the first quarter of the month, as I think you know well, is typically the highest month for advisory fees, and those are about $1 billion in the month of January. So, if you just look from a seasonal standpoint, you'd have a decline of around $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion in the month. And then in addition to that and just commenting on the overall market activity, we have seen just broad adviser and investor reengagement in the marketplace. I think a good way to summarize that is our customer net buying metric. The highest month -- if you look at our monthly metrics, the highest month we've ever had was back in August of 2022 at $10 billion for the month.  For January, what we're seeing is just north of $11 billion, so the strongest engagement that we've had. And that money is really going back into the equity markets and, as you may expect, longer-dated fixed income securities and things like that. So that's naturally going to drive down balances when you pull those seasonal factors, and combined with the investment engagement, we expect January cash sweep to be around $60 billion -- in the $60 billion. I think specific to the -- I think the third question, the last part of your question, on the market for ICA contracts. The headline I'd give you is it continues to improve throughout 2022, continued to improve in Q4 and maybe break it up into two buckets. The market for the floating rate balances, the demand continues to be well in excess of the deposits that we have, and you're starting to see that lead to price improvement.  So, for the contracts that we're putting from a floating rate standpoint now, they're more fed funds plus 10 or 15 as opposed to last quarter, they were plus five to 10 and then back in the heart of the pandemic, if we could place them at all, it was fed funds flat to down. So, the market there is quite good. On the fixed rate side, we're able to add $4 billion in balances this quarter ranging from two to six years. And I think when you combine that with the progress in the past few quarters, we're now not at our high but starting to get close to the high that we've had from a percent of the portfolio at 45%.  And when we look ahead to Q1, we've got $2 billion of maturities coming up. And I think we feel quite good about being able to place those into new fixed rate agreements and, even beyond that, starting to be able to continue to grow the portfolio overall, just seeing the overall demand.  So, headline, I'd say from my side, Alex, is pretty good. Yes. Well, I think, Alex, the key point on the lending side is it's not a big use of the balance sheet. So, it's really more about connecting the capabilities so our clients can use that. I think on the buyback, I think just going back to our overall capital allocation framework, I think we're focused on investing in organic growth first, M&A second and capital returns third.  And I think from a pace of the buyback, it would just all depend upon the opportunities that we see. So, if the opportunities to invest in organic growth weren't there or M&A wasn't as strong as we would expect, I think that's a scenario where we could accelerate buyback. And then the opposite is also true. We can slow it down if opportunities would lead there. So, the key for us is really to be flexible. And maybe I'd just reiterate that our center of gravity is really that $250 million. Yes, Steve. I think on our plans, I mean they really -- they didn't change at all from Investor Day. I think the key is we gave our preliminary thinking there and really went through our typical year-end process to finalize those plans. And I think that's where the 12% to 15% comes from. So, I think the strategy that we have of using this environment really to advance our investments is just the same, and you're just seeing us now land the plane with a sharper pencil. I think specific to the three categories, I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is informative. I think when you look at the investments to support our core business growth, right, assuming that growth is continuing, I think that level of 4% to 5% supports that growth.  When you look at the second and third categories, by definition, that's where we have flexibility. And we can adjust those based on the market and whether there's opportunity to spend in those areas or not, especially that third category where it's all about advancing things that we may have otherwise done in '24 and beyond that we're now going to do in '23. Yes. I think, Bill, our perspective on fixed rates really to get into that target range we have of 50% to 75%. And I think the -- if you cut out while I was commenting, I think the comment on the market is it continues to improve, right? It's not perfect, right? We can't move exactly where we want. But I think if you look at the trends throughout 2022 and as we look ahead into what we're seeing already in Q1, demand continues to improve.  So, I think we feel good about the maturities that we knew fixed rate agreements. You can see what we did in Q4 that we're targeting to go out in the five and even, in some cases, a six-year zone based on what the market will bear. And then when you look at the demand overall, in addition to those maturities, I think we feel like we've got the opportunity to grow it in some amount from there.  so, the headline is the marketplace is strong. And I think with where the curve is, we still think it makes sense to target getting into that range if the market will allow us to do so. Yes. I mean I think when you get to our long-term cost strategy, Bill, where that fourth principle is really adjusting our cost to the market, right, so I think, as you may expect, we'll make judgments about 2024 as we get closer to that year. But I would emphasize from an optionality standpoint, when you look at that third category of 4% to 5%, that is opportunistic. The market, especially for 2023 with the interest rate benefits that we have, allow us to make those investments.  And you can look at our op margins with the tailwind of interest rates or op margins continuing to be quite strong, we're in a good place to do that. If the market does not allow us to do that, we've got the ability to adjust. So, I think I would definitely take away that we've got the flexibility. And when you start to look beyond 2023, we'll make those judgments as we get closer to that time period. Yes, this is Matt. I'll take that one. I think there's -- when you think about that third bucket, it's more about the timing of the investments. So there's no specific category. I think you go back to the investments that we're making in technology and capabilities that help improve our value proposition or help support and open up our expanded markets. And when you think about those plans, we've got multiyear plans on the things that we think are quite important. And that third bucket is really about, given the environment that we're in, accelerating some of those plans. So that's the headline there. I don't know, Dan, if there's anything you want to add. Yes. I mean I don't have an update on the number of accounts. I would emphasize, though, I think the point you're making, it is a fee per account. So the -- so we quote it in basis points, but it's a little hard for it to be predictive, just given balances to move up and down. So it's the account, I would emphasize they haven't changed materially. But when you get a pop perhaps like you've seen in this quarter, that may not be something that you would expect to see going forward just because it's not really rate driven, it's fee per account driven. Yes. So the large financial institutions, that's what you're asking about, on the brokerage assets? Yes, it's relatively minor. I mean the growth rate was 7% for the quarter. Prior to that, it'd be 6.5%. So a relatively minor part of it in the quarter. Yes. I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, I think, is really the leverage ratio that we think makes sense in a range of different economic environments. And I think the ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and have the capacity to invest for growth in a range of different environments, I think, is a key part of our value proposition.  I think it's a key part for our advisers and clients knowing that if the macro moves against us, and we're not at a leverage ratio, we're going to have to immediately pull back on investments or immediately pull back on being able to serve and support them and the host of capabilities that we have, recruiting and succession being an example. So I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, we landed on that with a view that that's the right leverage ratio in a range of environments. And I think it certainly a key part of the value prop that differentiates from some of the firms that you mentioned. And I think where we are today, being at the low end or just below the low end of that, with a fair bit of capital deployment coming our way in Q1, including the acquisitions that we closed, as well as being positioned at that point in a macro that's, I think, anything but certain at this point, I think we like where we're sitting."

In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and the important role they play for their clients. We thank them for their continued commitment and dedication as we focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their client. With respect to our performance, our fourth quarter business results drove a solid financial outlook, while at the same time, we continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $21 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to net new assets for the year of $96 billion, also representing an 8% organic growth. Recruited assets were $15 billion Q4, bringing our total for the full year to $82 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination which drove solid same-store sales in the fourth quarter. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention for the fourth quarter and full year was approximately 98%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.21 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $11.52, an increase of 64% from a year ago. Now let's turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business.  Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions to help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experience to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts the extraordinary business.  Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business, by winning in our traditional markets, also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our addressable market. In our traditional markets, ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team led to continued improvement to our win rates and an expansion of the depth and breadth of our despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.  As a result, Q4 was our strongest quarter of recruiting in 2022 in our traditional markets with approximately $11 billion in assets. looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q1. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $1 billion in assets in Q4. In each of these models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions for our organic growth. With respect to large enterprises, they remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2022, including the additions of CUNA and People's United. Looking ahead, we expect to onboard Commerce Bank around the middle of this year and continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. And at the same time, we continue to have success recruiting in our traditional enterprise channel, including the addition of bank for [indiscernible] South in Q4. Within this strategic play, we are also seeing positive early momentum with our most recent innovation of liquidity and succession capability where we are providing a differentiated offer to meet succession needs of the advisers. Over the next decade, it is estimated that up to 1/3 of advisers will be retired and will likely address succession needs of their practices. To solve for this need, our first innovation was providing M&A support service to help facilitate the transition of practices from adviser to advisory. Our key learnings from that experience, there are many instances due to factors like large practice size or lack of an identified successor that will require a different solution.  And without of this need, we created our differentiated liquidity and succession offering, which LPL will step in to purchase an adviser's business and serve as a bridge to the next entrepreneurial successor, all while preserving the principles of independent. The offering has been well received and we are encouraged our early momentum, having already executed on a handful of transactions with providers on our product. This year, we will also plan to take the capability to the external marketplace and look forward to sharing our progress. Our second strategic play is to provide capability to help our advisers differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency in the back. In 2023, we will focus our development of new capabilities and solutions within this play across four key areas. First, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients to differentiated advice, products and pricing.  Second, we will continue to advance ClientWorks, our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more fun. Third, we will expand our banking and lending services to help advisers address a broader spectrum of the clients' financial needs and thus deepen their role as an essential partner.  And the final area is to enrich the end client experience with additional digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention. Now let's move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention.  As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an omnichannel client care model, including voice, chat and digital support.  And as part of this journey, we have evolved the technology and instrumentation of our traditional voice channel while also making meaningful enhancements to our always- on digital support capabilities. As a result, approximately 75% of engagements with our digital channel fully resolve the service request and don't necessitate a phone call to complete the task. As we continue to expand and refine our digital support channel, we believe that an increasing share of advisers will leverage digital-first support for more flexible and efficient service experience. As we continue to evolve our service interface, we're also transforming the operational processing that takes place behind that interface. For example, last year, we began automating much of the processing for our core clearing, including money movement, account opening and account transfer, which collectively drive the majority of our operational process.  And with these learnings from our transformation and service and operations, we are reengineering other areas of the business, including our compliance and risk management. Out of that end, we've applied robotics and AI capabilities through a number of our compliance review workloads, which has improved both the efficiency of the reviews as well as the efficacy of the overall risk management.  Efforts on this front include automating the reviews of client communications, marketing materials and transactions. Now by automating more workflows, we continue to increase the scalability of our platform while also enhancing plan is good. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from driving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their client. As we discussed last quarter, we are encouraged by the seasoning of this business and the evolving appeal of our value proposition.  As a result of solid demand, in Q4, the number of advisers utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the year at over 3,000 active users, up more than 30% year-over-year and generating run rate revenue of $36 million. Now when we started our services group, we focused on addressing some of the most complex challenges facing our advisers. We were often more acute for advisers with larger practices. With the insights and learnings from this initial client segment, we're now expanding our service portfolio to address the needs of a broader adviser base. As we continue to evolve the offering in 2023, we are focused on several key opportunities for our services group: first, addressing additional channels, specifically building solutions solve for needs of enterprises; second, leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to continue to develop new services and evolve our existing portfolio; and third, contributing to the growth of our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth and Linsco, as well as expanding our ability to serve high net worth. So, in summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. So, let me take that one, Steven. There's a lot there, so if I missed something, you give me guidance after I finish. So, Look, I think if we start as a jump-off point, last year, 80% organic growth rate, $96 billion in NNA, which is a pretty solid outcome against a challenging macro backdrop.  And I think irrespective of that backdrop, I think making the progress or working through sort of that environment, both in terms of our teams and advisers, you just continue to evolve capabilities, skills and operating in any potential environment. So, I think as we look forward and we think about going forward, we feel good that the sort of the acclamation to an upper macro, if it sustains itself, that we can execute in it better and ultimately contribute improved or better growth. So that's how I would sort of think about the environmental. It may influence what I might call short- term progress around our growth ethics.  I think, probably more importantly, strategically, as we think about our opportunity those drivers of that strategy, right, those significant structural, big durable trends all remain in place. It's growing demand for advice. The appeal of receiving that advice through a financial professional, the attractiveness of the independent model versus other models all continue.  And I think we sit at the intersection of all of those and believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. And whether that's through our market leadership, singular focus on what we do, robust platform of which to leverage and use and differentiate or even the capacity and commitment to invest, but that was just speaking of to evolve platform and continue to differentiate it. So, I think as we think about going forward, that comes up to that 7% to 13% sort of growth rates that we talked about across different macro environments, I think, is still highly relevant, still how we think about it. And I think last year demonstrated the ability to persevere through a tougher macro and still reside within that range. So that's how we think about the shorter run and the longer run. I think to your click down on the enterprises within that, look, it's a channel that we've talked about is a durable growth contributor. We've continued to evolve our capability set with more wins and with good success with those relationships, create better advocacy from our clients and that IP and insight from being on the court for a couple of years working on those large enterprises is certainly IP that's hard to replicate without that experience itself.  And so, when we look at that going forward, it's a pretty appealing model that is finding a marketplace that is in need of that type of model, and we're pretty convicted around our solution. So, we do believe that, again, within those bookends of 7% to 13%, we do get some contribution from large enterprise. So, I hope that gives you a little color. Yes. Devin, it's Dan. So, look, as we think about the opportunity set in the high net worth space, and I speak now of the end client segment when I refer to high net worth, that's a function of our advisers' overall evolving practices. And as they have clients or more clients that they have an opportunity to serve inside that category, that's really driven the demand for services and capabilities that traditionally may not have sat inside our overall sweet spot. And so, I think that's been the real catalyst for the driver of our contemplation of building out certain capabilities. And so, examples of that are us building out our own service around complex case design, right? And so that would be an investment that shows up in the core G&A reference that Matt was making, as an example, to your question. I think you also see that in extended financial planning support. It's not just the technology, but it's the Paraplanning services that sit around it, as an example. So those are things that we're building ourselves or organic capabilities that we're building ourselves. So, as we've gone on the journey, we will -- we have built and we'll continue to build certain things that are in-house. There's also other things that we think are important to serve high net worth types of clients, maybe that's tailored insurance offerings that we traditionally haven't done inside our own insurance agency or services like helping to sell a small or midsized business.  And that's where we'll -- we are developing strategic partnerships of which to provide those integrated solutions and services inside our overall offering rather than building. And so that's how we're putting together what we think is a compelling set of solutions that position our advisers to serve and support their high net worth clients. Now as we built out those capabilities or we're in the progress of, it also challenges us then to say, well, how do we better deploy those to the marketplace or leverage those, if you will. And I think that's where we realized with the capability set that we have today, could we utilize that to even target what I might call advisers who specifically operate with only high net worth clients.  And I think that would be an example of how we better leverage these capabilities, and that's something we continue to explore in terms of how we go to market with this capability. But think about it that way, is we're building some of these capabilities. We've been on a journey, we're not completely there, but we've made some significant progress.  And then we'll look to the outside market strategic partnerships. And I'm doing that, I think we can take the capital-light model to what is a compelling value proposition, use it to support our existing advisers and help us potentially attract new. Yes. I think we'll continue to see that ongoing trend around consolidation. I think you're continuing to see innovation around capabilities as well, and so that leads to transactions around a certain type of IP or capability set that firms may want to deploy or utilize in a different way.  And then we're seeing more robust activity around solving for succession planning at the individual adviser level and/or smaller practices level. And so, I think you're seeing a healthy amount of activity across the ecosystem. We continue to stay active in exploring all of those possibilities, right? And you see us deploying capital, as an example, the closings we did yesterday with Boenning & Scattergood and FRGIS.  I would just remind you our framework for exploring those possibilities, and you know these, first, it's in sort of side that what I would call growth opportunities in traditional markets where we see opportunity for purposes of growth to potentially acquire a practice, and Boenning & Scattergood would be a great example of that, what would be a great example of that. We also look in that second category where we can add capabilities faster through an acquisition than building them ourselves. We believe we've got to stay open and agile and nimble around that framework. And then the final one, the third one, which is a little newer one and is aligned with this new capability of liquidity and succession, is putting capital work through acquiring these practices and being that bridge to that future successors. So, I think that's where we're active, that's where we're exploring potential possibilities. And we see pretty good activity going on in the consumer market. Yes, Michael, I'll take that one, and certainly, Matt, you add anything you want at the end. Look, we look at pricing as above our overall offering. Think about such capability, services, technology. We look at pricing as part of our overall investment strategy, if you will. And I think as we shared in the past, we've created a reoccurring theme of investing back into the platform, specifically trying to use price to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. And so I think that places that we've been historically focused on for the past, call it, four to five years has been typically around the advisory platform, right, 70%, 75% of new assets -- sorry, yes, new cash is going to those types of solutions, and we want to make sure that we're enriching the appeal of them. And so as we look at 2023, you'll see us continue to lower pricing around our centrally managed platforms as a way to create more applications for advisers to leveraging middle all of those, refined with the enriched capability set that we're adding to them, more and more using them versus that was the type of purchase.  You're also seeing us look at transaction charges in certain areas where we're being very tactical around that. Although this holistic sort of lowering of transaction, we're trying to be very tactical about where we make those changes, such that we actually make the adjustments on where they make the most sense for our advisers that ultimately help them. And so I think those are a couple of examples that we'll continue to pursue this year. So whatever we can do that we think is optimal to help our advisers differentiate and win in the places that matters most of them is what we're trying to solve for. Those are a couple. I hope that helps. I would just give you an additional way to frame that. If you remember back at the Investor and Analyst Day that we did, we shared the framework around vertical integration and a lot of those investments are showing off that spectrum of opportunities that we have. So as we drive more and more solutions into sort of that lower in the ecosystem where it really helps the adviser operate at a local level, but you'll find it also coming all the way back to things that enhance our advisory platform. And so I think you're seeing an accelerated investment across that entire spectrum as opposed to any one specific play. So I hope that helps to keep your framework to think about how we think about the spectrum of investments and perhaps how that's been [indiscernible]. Yes. So obviously, with respect to our advisory platforms, that fits inside that overall spectrum of offering. And as we think about enriching that entire platform, one of the places we've been focused on is centrally managed solutions. And we continue to add more capabilities and more value there. We think about the investment content that's available, the ability for advisers to use that in different ways, really turning that into a UMA and expanding the SMAs that are available on it.  There's really cool enhancements and functionality that is materially improving the appeal and how one would apply it in more scenarios and cases. So we're excited about the potential opportunity and for it to continue to sort of grow share, if you will, in that overall mix of business, both with respect to advisory but we even think about it across a full spectrum of brokerage, because the more appealing we make this even at smaller accounts, where it's appropriate, and people feel that the plan is better served from that movement of brokerage to advisory, a lot of that would tend to move over to centrally managed solution. So that's one way to think about how we add capability to make it more appealing to drive utilization. And I think we believe that upside can be significant, certainly continuing to invest in the pricing helps also drive the appeal and demand for it. And think about, as you think about last year and rightfully so, still good demand but the trend was down.  Historically speaking, centrally managed usually reacts more or is more impacted, if you will, by a challenging macro environment. The more volatility, the more sort of a downward trend in equity markets, and in fact, we had the combination of tough fixed income markets last year, and that's where we'll many times see an adviser sort of more want to put their hands on the wheel and drive that. So you're seeing some of that sort of volatility in the marketplace, the macro marketplace noise occurring in that trend. I think structurally speaking, we continue to invest in the appeal of it. And the more appealing we make it, the more it should drive up utilization on a relevant basis. I hope that helps. Yes. So look, I think the recruiting environment, I think it's well documented over the last three years, the churn in the industry has slowed, right, from 2022 to -- sorry, 2020 to 2022, primarily driven on the backs of the pandemic and then the macro volatility last year, which are pretty extreme impacts. And so certainly, with less sort of swings in the batter's box, I think you have competitors that will tend to respond to that in different ways and some have gotten more aggressive on the transition of systems. That's what we're talking about, about being more aggressive.  And then certainly, when you add to that the rising interest rates that can be more robustly monetized, and thus so in underwriting around deals, you'll see transition systems get more aggressive in those types of environments. And I think it -- logic would have it, that's what would occur, and that's what we've seen over last three years. I think, look, for us, we don't see any changes in the opportunity set. I think the -- as we think about it, the ongoing evolution of our capabilities, the expansion of our market opportunity set with our expanded affiliation models, introduction of our services group, advocacy of existing advisers from good experiences, are really the key drivers of that opportunity set and our ability to drive win rates regardless of what the churn or opportunity set is in the marketplace.  We did see the -- sorry, the market stabilizing more in the third and fourth quarter and more advisers now getting past that volatility and reengaging and exploring their strategic options. And I think to the extent that there's not some big shift in the macro, we continue to expect to see that trend occurring.  And you'll continue to see folks explore that movement from an employee-based model to independent model. We continue to see with more and more capabilities, folks in the independent model, looking for something that can serve and support them better and taking care of their clients. And finally, even with being able to help with their own succession planning creates another catalyst of opportunities.  So I think we think those things are much more important and bigger drivers of the ultimate sort of size of the movement, but certainly in the short run, there's been some noise or in immediate term, pretty extreme scenarios, right, of the macro, given the pandemic and the first equity markets last year since 2008.  I hope that helps give you some color on at least what we're seeing over the recruiting landscape. Maybe to add to that, if you're curious around why the trend or better growth in brokerage over the past three to four quarters, I think that's the evolving interest rate environment and advisers using solutions that may be more brokerage-oriented solutions, whether that be fixed income or whether that be annuities of which to help clients seeking higher yield or higher rates. And so that's where you're seeing some of that growth come from that wasn't necessarily the trend prior to last year. Thanks much, John, and I just want to thank everyone for taking their valuable time out to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Amy. And thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, amid persistent market volatility, our advisors continued to be a source of support and guidance for their clients by helping them navigate uncertainty. This commitment to their clients underscores the importance of our work on our mission, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. With respect to our performance, third quarter was marked resilient business results which drove solid financial out, as well as continued progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business. In the third quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Third quarter net new assets were $20 billion, representing 7% annualized just contributed to net new assets over the past 12 months of $101 billion, representing 9% organic revenue. Looking at recruited assets, they were $13 billion in Q3, bringing our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion. These results were driven by the on-going enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, against the backdrop of continued market volatility, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with this combination with existing market, combination which drove improvement in same-store sales in the third quarter. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the on-going modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter, and 98% over the past 12-months. Our third quarter business results lead to solid financial outcomes of $3.13 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 77% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire advisor center market, which for us, means being the best at empowering advisors and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. For bringing this vision to life, we're providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients, at the same time through human driven technology enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisors in their efforts, the extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisory experience organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we've organized our work into four strategic planning plays, which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses, by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our adjustable model. A recruiting in traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q3, with approximately $6 billion in assets. We continue to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, despite advisor movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. Following several quarters of elevated market volatility, advisors are acclimating to the conditions and increasingly exploring new strategic alternatives for their practice. This creates a more favorable scenario for us as market driven headwinds give way to the structural strength per model. This should result in a solid finish to the year from a recruiting team. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employees and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in the quarter and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models. With respect to large financial institutions, over the past two quarters, we onboarded two new clients, CUNA and People's United. We continue to learn from each experience and use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LTL, and in turn, helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in the practices. A particular area of focus is helping our advisors create a digital experience for their clients. It's personalized for their practice. As an example, this quarter we extended the flexibility our advisors have and how they utilize their brand, and the optionality of the content and features they present to their clients. In addition, we're always looking for opportunities to arm our advisors and in clients with expanded tools, products and services to navigate markets. To that end, we continue to build out our research capabilities in terms of content and subject matter expertise. We've also increased our focus on certain products like annuities and alternative investments, which are in higher demand in this market. To that end, we're working on making it easier and more efficient for advisors to provide these products, also expanding the breadth of solutions available to meet the client's needs. These enhancements help advisors broaden their value proposition and enrich the offering they provide to their clients, which further contributes to the appeal of our platform, both existing and prospective deposits. Well, let's next move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an end-to-end client care model. And we think about this journey through two primary lenses, transforming our service interface, and reimagining the operational processing that takes place behind that. Aspiration is provide advisors a multichannel experience, across voice, chat, digital first support, thus offering them greater flexibility for when and how they access service. While we continue to fine tune each of these three channels, we're currently focused on our digital first report, we see it as an opportunity to create an easier and more efficient experience for our advisors to access the information they need. And as we expand these capabilities, advisors can increasingly engage more and more digitally to resolve their requests. And many have already shared they prefer the simpler option over making a phone call. While we're still in the early innings, we believe these enhancements will have a meaningful impact scalability of our platform, while also enhancing the client experience. Our four strategic players focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisors and institutions run thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. We're encouraged by the seasoning of this business and our value proposition continues to resonate with advisors. Four years ago, we started our service group with a strategic goal of solving the practice level challenges advisors face, so they can spend more time with the client. Through ongoing innovation and expansion, these efforts have translated into the comprehensive portfolio of services we offer today. And as a result of growing demand, our services group subscription base continued to increase, ending the period at roughly 4200 and generating run rate revenue of $34 million. As we work with advisors on existing services, we continue to identify and solve for new needs on their behalf. One example is the launch of our latest solution bookkeeping services. And based on insights from CFO solutions, we created a new service to help advisors further streamline the business decisions with accurate and timely financial reports. As a result, advisors can spend more time growing and managing their business or also tracking profits in closing. Looking at our innovation pipeline for the remainder of the year, we have several services in pilot and others in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our portfolio, better support our advisors and to drive growth. In summary, in the third quarter, we continue to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, I have long-term shareholder that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we enhanced our sweep deposit program with the launch of the client cash account and onboarding people as you noted today. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the market. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1 trillion down 2% from Q2, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. Total net new assets were $20 billion or 7% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $13 billion, bringing our 12-month total to $84 billion. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher ICA balances and expenses led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $3.13. This was up 77% from a year ago, and is the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $838 million, up $127 million or 18% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $182 million, down $23 million from chip. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick and production bonus expense, and lower advisory fees following the Q2 equity market supply. Our payout rate for the quarter was 87.9%, up about 90 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding unit. Regarding asset base revenue, sponsor revenue was $194 million in Q3, down $14 million sequentially. The decrease in Q3 was driven by lower average assets during the quarter, as well as a non-recurring $8 million sponsor payment in Q2. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $304 million, up $147 million from Q2 driven by higher average short term interest rates as well as higher ICA balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, the end of the quarter at $67 billion, down $3 billion sequentially driven by client net buying activity of $20 million, which is the highest quarterly level we have ever seen. Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q3 as we saw further improvements in banks deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $7 billion. And I would highlight that $5 billion of that increase was a new fixed rate contracts. Looking more closely at our ICA yields, it was 212 basis points in Q3 up 78 basis points from Q2, primarily driven by the increase in short term rates during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q4 we expect your ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to increase to approximately 265 basis. As for service and fee revenue, it was $122 million in Q3, up $9 million from Q2, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRAP [ph]. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with roughly 4200 subscriptions, which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $34 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q4 results, we do not have any large advisor conferences in the quarter. We expect service and fee revenue to decline by roughly $5 million sequentially. Regarding Q3 transaction revenue, it was $43 million down $1 million sequentially as trading volumes declined. As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in training activity in October. That said, I would note there is one less trading day. So that would likely offset that. And so based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat we feel great. Turning now to expenses, Core G&A was $298 million in Q3 up $12 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to invest to drive growth. So while we expect to be within our full year 2022 Core G&A outlook range, we expect to be towards the higher end. As a result, we are tightening the outlook to a range of $1,185 million to $1,195 million. On Q3 promotional expense, it was $99 million up $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher conference expense because we hosted our largest advisor conference of the year, which returned to an in person format for the first time in three years. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect lower conference spend partially offset by continued growth and recruiting transition system. As a result, we expect promotional expense will decrease by approximately $15 million sequentially. With respect to depreciation and amortization, it was $52 million in Q3 up $3 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $33 million in Q3, up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increase the cost of our floating rate debt. Looking ahead to Q4 given where LIBOR rates are today, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $36 million. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q3 with corporate cash at $424 million, up $183 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio was 1.7 times down from 2.1 times in Q2. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power. As we look at our leverage ratio going forward, our balance sheet strategy is unchanged. Our focus is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can absorb a market downturn, while at the same time having the capacity to invest for growth. With our improved earnings power, we are updating our leverage target to a range of one and a half to two and a half times, which we believe positions us well to operate over a range of economic cycles, and strikes the right balance between preserving balance sheet strength and investing for growth. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $75 million of our shares. As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $150 million. This will complete our existing authorization of $1 billion that we established at the end of 2018. Looking to 2023, we work to put in place a new share repurchase authorization, our focus was on an amount that we'd be in a position to execute against over roughly two years. With that framing in mind, we established a new authorization of $2 billion, which we expect to begin executing in the first quarter of 2023. As always, we will retain the flexibility to adjust the pace to repurchases as the environment warrants or as other capital allocation opportunities across organic growth and M&A merge. In closing we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will ask our operator Amy to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon. So I wanted to start off with a question, Matt, just on the buyback and the adjusted leverage target range. So certainly pleased to see or hear both. I was hoping you could frame the timing or cadence for executing that $2 billion buyback authorization. And just given the meaningful step up, you should see in EBITDA and leverage likely to fall below the low end of that target range in the coming quarters. Just in the absence of any opportunities around M&A, how should we think about your willingness or appetite to optimize buybacks and stay within that leverage target range over the long term?\nMatthew Audette: Sure. I mean I think the core of it, as I talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks, is making sure that we're balancing having a strong balance sheet with deploying capital to drive growth. And I think when we think through the prioritization of that, it is focused on organic growth versus M&A second and then returning capital to shareholders third. And I think what you hear us saying on the $2 billion over two years that we think around $250 million. And I would emphasize roughly, right, roughly $250 million a quarter is that right allocation. Now if we get through a period of time over that two years, where interest rates are elevated for an extended period of time or there's just fewer opportunities to deploy capital towards organic growth or M&A., I would expect that pace to increase and for us to execute against faster. And I'd highlight, if the opposite occurs, we see more opportunities for organic growth and more opportunities for M&A that would expect it to slow down. So it's really just about the opportunities that we see, and we'll make those judgments along the way.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And maybe for my follow-up, a question for Dan on the M&A landscape, certainly, higher rates bolsters your relative competitive position versus peers, particularly those that are in self-clearing. I was hoping you could speak to the environment for deal activity. How active you expect to be on the M&A front? And just the willingness of any targets to engage just given the pressures that they've been feeling in terms of equity market declines without the similar benefit or the offsetting benefit from higher rates?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So Steven thanks for the question. And as Matt said, when you think about that allocation of capital, we obviously prioritize that to organic ours. And then we look to M&A as a complement to that organic growth. And I think as we've said before, there's two key areas. We continue to explore and look to the M&A marketplace for and that's to enhance or speed up capabilities that we deliver and make available to our advisers and/or 1 that contributes to our overall growth. And I think with respect to that second category, we continue to look through the entire ecosystem from smaller growth-oriented deals like the binding scattered good ample that you saw us do in the second quarter all the way up to if there were a more opportunistic opportunity to create value, deploy our capital in a way that makes sense relative to other options and alternatives that operationally, we can consume that acquisition and execute on it well fits inside our strategy, then we would be interested in certainly exploring those opportunities in. So I don't think our posture has changed at all relative to our strategy and how we think about using and leveraging M&A. Certainly, we get your point around how the market may -- and conditions in the market may change that may make those acquisition opportunities more right for available. And again, we stay consistent in our exploration of the market, looking at where we can complement our [indiscernible]. So I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Please standby for our next question. And our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question as well. So maybe I could start with also a bit of a strategic question, along similar lines to Steven\u2019s question around M&A. But your cash flow characteristics, obviously improving meaning from the level, but also the visibility as you're starting to extend more. So from an organic perspective, if you were to think about areas where you'd want to invest more in to accelerate organic growth from here, what are the products? And what are the channels where you think that could be the best opportunity to accelerate investment in order to capture a higher share of the organic growth opportunity?\nDan Arnold: Yes, let me start, then Matt you can you can add to that a compliment that. It's a sort of question. It's a great question. So I think, look, we would look across two different, obvious landscapes. One would be, how do we continue to create capabilities that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Think about anything across the spectrum of our wealth management platforms and offerings, the more that we can automate from that the advisory platforms expand the content. In terms of investment options, alternatives, we continue to invest significantly in our centrally managed platform, turning that into a really interesting and competitive UMA platform. Those are examples of where we would think about added capabilities that I think continue to help our advisors differentiate when other great examples of that are in our financial planning capabilities. That's where planning comes in and tax planning overlays, etcetera or again, other places, we, we believe the advisors can show up in the marketplace with a broadening and compelling value proposition. So that's just one example of where we would focus. Again, the second one would be in this area of how do we help them run better businesses. And anything that we can do that, that makes them more effective at making better decisions, and really understanding what's happening in their businesses. So using data turned into analytics to create better decision making, creating leverage points and expertise, whether that be like, our CMO marketing solution, as an example, our CFO solution, those are examples of where we would continue to invest in capability and services. So you take that combination of technology and services combined, all for the purpose of helping them deliver better advice and differentiate by so that they win more, and then ultimately, to help them operate and run better businesses. That's where you should think about us celebrating and enhancing our overall spin model. Think at the same time. Look, we continue to explore how do we expand and evolve our affiliation models such that, you extend your addressable market, you actually create more and more flexibility and optionality for how that advisor may plug into our platform, or may evolve, how they use our platform over time, we think are really compelling and interesting places to continue to invest. So those are just a couple of examples of how we might think about deploying into our overall capability set that would drive new store sales, same store sales and -- all of which would obviously contribute towards the end of [Indiscernible]. Matt, I don't know if you want to add?\nMatthew Audette: No, you covered it up.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, thanks. Thanks for that. And my quick follow up is just from that, clearly the dynamics and the broker sweep channel have changed quite rapidly here in the last three months, even in with banks starting to see more deposit outflows. How are you thinking about the spread on the ICA portfolio, obviously, on the variable piece, the fixed, I don't think has a spread on it. But -- are you starting to see competition getting to a point where spreads could actually start to increase over the last couple of quarters? And kind of how would you think about the bookends or where they could ultimately go?\nDan Arnold: Yes, we're definitely seeing demand leading, leading to those spreads. So maybe just to walk back kind of pre-COVID. I think we landed in a zone where we would typically be able to get Fed funds plus 20, maybe 25. And then during COVID, if you were if you're lucky enough to get it as usually said, funds minus, and then and I think we lived in a place of round Fed Funds flat as we know, probably the last year or so. And then I think what we're seeing right now and even the new variable contracts that we're putting in place right now we're at a spread of, plus 5 to 10. Right, so you're starting to see things come back and I think I don't I don't see anything just think that the book ended where we were with free code that plus 20 to 25. I think that's a good place to point to on where we think it would go. But I think the trend is a positive one. And we're seeing it each quarter including this quarter with that plus 5 to 10.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Just a question on the bank mandates. We saw the People's United come through in the quarter, can you just remind us how much if any, is there still outstanding to come through from a funding standpoint on that, or CUNA or others, as we kind of look through the rest of the year and into next year in terms of remaining balances to come through? And then if you could just maybe more broadly, update us on the pipeline and the conversations that you're having with banks, regarding outsourcing arrangements? And would you be surprised if there were no additional announcements on that front over the next 12 months?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Let me take that. Or, Matt, you want to start with this, what's outstanding in terms of the balances to transition the unit? And then I'll pick up?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Yes, it sounds good. I think it's mostly onboarded between the two of those. I'd call it in the $1.5 billion on that left to come on board. And that's on the direct side. So that takes a little bit longer for that process for those over, but $1.5 billion would be the right time.\nDan Arnold: And then maybe for the second part of your question. So look, we continue to see these financial institutions as an affiliation model that we believe has ongoing growth opportunity. And I think we selectively added roughly $65 billion, $70 billion in large financial institution assets over the last couple of years and continue to see strong momentum in the demand for the solution of the offering, which really just sort of introduced a new concept into an outsourcing model sort of scale into the marketplace, right? So all the value proposition that we've talked about originally, everything from the risk management profile shift all the way to better client experiences attracting better advise or better financial results all still hold. And I think what we've done over the last couple of years is as we've added these larger institutions, we continue to innovate both in terms of how we support them day in and day out. And also this is partly how you transition them over. That's a pretty big change management effort as you could imagine. And I think given that over the last couple of years, we continue to make our model more and more appealing. So as we talk to future prospects. I think we're able to continue to expand the value, which we provide and deliver for them, the quality at which we do it and simplify the change management effort in the overall transition. So with that, momentum that we have matched with the improvement in enhancing value proposition, we believe and are still very optimistic in the sort of growing durability around the growth opportunity and have a good solid pipeline. And though these deals are a little bit harder to predict in terms of the timing because they're longer sales cycle, feel good that we have opportunity to continue the momentum.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. And just a follow-up question on the technology portfolio spend. I think you guys are expecting a little over $200 million or so this year. Can you just remind us what portion of that goes through the P&L versus what's capitalized? How you see that evolving? And then on the P&L, we see D&A continues to drift higher, what sort of growth rate can we expect there on depreciation and amortization relative to the 24% growth that we saw in the quarter on a year-on-year basis?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. On that growth rate, I mean, I think when you look at the last few quarters there's been a few million a quarter on that depreciation and amortization growth, and that's primarily the tech portfolio, the capitalized piece that goes there. So I think that's a good framing to think about that. On the tech portfolio, the capitalization versus expense rate, it moves around depending on the type of work that we're doing in that particular quarter. But I think a good rule of thumb is 70% capitalized 30% expense.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start, we've heard from some other wealth management firms that have seen a shift and more growth on the brokerage side driven by investor demand to go and find yield and buy more interest in bonds and whatnot. Are you seeing that as well? And should we maybe tweak our expectations for your mix of growth in the near term?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So short answer is we are seeing some mix. I think you're right in assessing that it's very much sort of environmentally driven by the macro market conditions. Fixed income is a good example of that. I think you're also seeing it in the alt space and in annuities. And those drive a higher mix of perhaps deploying capital to new solutions in a kind of a time-bound way relative to the market conditions. I think you've also seen it show up in a bit of a slowdown in some of the transition from brokerage to advisory. In the short run as well, we think that structural trend still makes sense and still expect that to continue. I just think you have a little bit of that sort of environmental noise overlay. So I think those are the right way to think about slight mix. If you look at our overall macro trend that we still expect to see much more assets deployed to advisories which is for all the structural reasons that we've talked about before. And I think you'll see that we still sit in sort of that 52% to 53% range of assets now in advisory, and that probably hasn't continued to trend up as much as we would have expected, a little bit because of the macro, probably more because of some of the larger bank or enterprise solutions that we brought on, just have a higher mix of brokerage assets than typically independent advisers that we recruit new. But we do expect once they get on to our platform and have new capabilities and access to perhaps better advisory tools, they typically begin to also see a trend or a transition of their books over time from brokerage to advisory.\nMatthew Audette: So I hope that color helps. You've got kind of the structural trend towards advisory that still exists to a little bit of an environmental influence over the [indiscernible].\nBrennan Hawken: Sure, little mix of cyclical and with the secular. That makes a lot of sense.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Yes.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, great. And then for my second question, I know it's early, but do -- and it will be impacted by a lot of factors that will come out and play out in the next several months. But any sense about how we should be thinking about expense growth for 2023. We've seen as the benefits of interest rates provide some tailwind that you have been driving a little bit of incremental investment in the platform. Should we assume that, that would continue along with a rate forecast that we might be using? Or -- and is there any reason to think that some of the expense growth or trajectory would slow for any reason at some point?\nMatthew Audette: Sure, Ben. I'll give -- it's a little early. I'll give you some color. I mean, I think when we think about -- to your point on interest rates and how that impacts our financials, when we do those economies, just building from the start of the cycle, right, early in the cycle, we were focused on that, the benefit from those increases falling to the bottom line and really improving margin, right? And then as we got deeper into the cycle, really pivoting to our capital allocation framework and allocating that capital across the 3 primary areas that we look at. And I think investments to drive and support organic growth is the primary category, the first category that we look at. And as you highlighted a bit when we look at this year, right, we've been accelerating investments to drive growth and support our advisers. And just looking at Core G&A, we've typically been in the mid-to-single -- mid-single-digit growth rates in the past. And this year, we'll be in the 12% to 13% range, right? And part of that increase is coming from those incremental earnings from rates that we're really deploying to improve our value competition. Now when we look across the other options, right, we see opportunities potentially in M&A, right? We see opportunities in returning capital to shareholders that we've talked about today, increasing the buyback in Q4 at $150 million and then pivoting to a $250 million -- roughly $250 million per quarter next year. Now on the level of investments next year, I think if the interest rate environment does play out like it's predicted, I think we're going to be in a position to have opportunities to invest and drive growth, and we'll apply the same framework on the capital allocation front that we always use to guide us. And I'll share a bit more color at Investor Day in a few weeks, and then we'll finalize those plans as we normally do and share them on our year-end earnings call.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks, good evening. I want to start with a question just on adviser recruiting. In volatile markets, typically, we see adviser appetite to move slow or go away. So good to hear the comment on the strong recruiting pipeline. So I'd like to just maybe dig in a little bit around kind of where you're seeing momentum across what channels, expectations will actually executing on that pipeline. And then I'm just curious, like maybe there's a little bit of a coiled spring building. So I'm assuming that natural conversions has slowed a bit, but maybe the actual conversations and what's in the pipeline is expanding. So I'd just love to get more color there. Thanks.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Devin, you said it, and we've talked about it, the macro conditions certainly can create some headwinds across new store sales or recruiting as we've talked about, right, the complexity in the marketplace drives focus on serving and supporting their clients in the short term, rightfully so and sometimes then delayed more strategic considerations. So I think we saw certainly a pickup in the third quarter as we talked about some of those market-driven headwinds beginning to give way to the structural desire of an adviser to improve their practice or their programs. And so we feel great about our pipeline across all of the different affiliation models that we have, certainly are traditional one as well as in the new models that we've created -- and so as we go forward, we feel like, certainly, as these advisers pivot back to focusing on structurally enhancing the program that aligns well with the feel and capabilities if our model sets up well for a good strong finish to the year from a recruiting standpoint. And again, I think you've seen it over the RIA channel the employee channel and the strategic wealth channel, right, those new models, we've consistently recruited a little over 2 billion each of the last three quarters. And so we feel good about going afield positioning in the marketplace for those as a great complement to our traditional markets. And then when you overlay the financial institution market over the top, it sets up for continued interesting evolution of our new store sales. And we continue to focus on trying to drive that higher as we go forward. I think if you look at the trailing 12, we've got about 84 billion in recruited results and outcomes, and we continue to work both on our efficacy to execute better, met with more appealing model met with the breadth of affiliation models to continue to drive that buying [ph]. Hope that answers\u2026\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Great color. Thank you. And as a follow-up, on customer cash, you appreciate it's primarily operational of LPL, and that's different than some others in the wealth space. But I just want to think about kind of the ranges of kind of where cash has trended its 6.4% of assets today, you're kind of at the higher end. I think the average from 2016 is like 5.3% in the low in 2019 was about 4%. So I just love any help thinking about kind of where we are in that range. I know we're in the higher end, but is 5.3% average, maybe where we get back to if sentiment in the market improves and gets back to something more normal, the denominator also matters quite a bit here. So just love to think about that range a little more to you and how you guys are thinking about maybe where cash could trend given that it is operational.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Yes. It's definitely operational. I think that the best things to look at are the history, the empirical data that you were referring to. I think an average of 5% is where we've been. So you think of that as maybe a market neutral position and the lows have gone down closer to 4%. But keep in mind, our mix of assets were different back then. They were more in brokerage than they are today. And advisory in general, will have a higher amount of cash to facilitate rebalance. So maybe that low end -- would that mix change, that low end feels more like 4.5% given that mix change. And I think you're right, where we're sitting today in that 6.5% zone is certainly towards the upper end. So that's the range that I would have.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Those are couple of contacts, so appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nWilliam Katz: Thank you very much. Good evening everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So just maybe picking up on that last line of questioning. Just given where you are, I wonder if you could update us on your thinking of sort of fixed to float relative to the 50% to 75% range. I see you sort of add 15 percentage points in the quarter. Is there any reason to think that you could take that number higher, all else being equal? And then how should we think about maybe the pacing to get back into the target range?\nMatthew Audette: Yes, Bill, and good to hear. Good to hear from you again. Welcome back. I think our target range remains at 50% to 75% in a rolling portfolio. So we're minimizing that interest rate volatility. And I think we're in periods of low rates, we'd want to stay closer to that 50% in periods of higher rates like we're getting into now, where there's also some steepness to the curve, I think we'd want to be closer to 75% -- and our ability to do that really is subject to the demand in the market, right? So maybe just a little bit of color on what we're seeing there is demand does continue to return, right? On ICA overall, right. We added $7 billion of balances in Q3, the majority of that $5 billion in fixed, and that brings the amount we've been able to add this year of new fixed to $9 billion, right? And that's the most we've been able to add in a single year ever, meaning even pre-COVID. So the environment is certainly improving. And then when you look at from this point forward, it does feel like that it's set up more demand to continue to be strong. Right, from the Fed side of raising rates and really shrinking their balance sheet to the banks themselves, where consumer spending continues to remain healthy. Loan balances are growing. And those are all the things that would lead to additional demand. Now whether that's fixed or not becomes more about those banks and what their asset liability management is and their interest in FX. So it becomes a little bit more challenging to take all that information and say that there'll be more fixed in -- but I feel confident overall that the environment is conducive to banks needing more ICA. And what we've seen so far has been approved. So we'll keep monitoring. But I think if the demand is there, we'll want to manage that 50% to 75% range we've talked through, which even though we've improved, we're still below the low end of that today.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up. Just coming back to your commentary and perhaps I heard this incorrectly, I apologize if that's the case. I heard you say that sort of the new target leverage ratio would be 1.5 to 2.5 and I'm looking at something correctly. It was previously 2 to 2 or 3 quarters turn. Why now to reduce it? It feels like the franchise has probably never been in better shape. The earnings power certainly cyclically has a significant step function in front of the next couple of years. What is it about the messaging of bringing that down? Is this a point of conservatism? Is there maybe less leverage opportunities going forward? I'm just trying to understand why you bring it down.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Yes, of course. So I think when we look at our strategy, right, which is unchanged, right? It's really focused on a combination of maintaining a strong balance sheet and having capacity to invest for growth. And the driver of the decline in the leverage ratio has really been our earnings power improving, right? Our growth, combined with the interest rate environment has driven the leverage ratio down. So given that and given -- and thinking about what our target leverage ratio should be, we wanted to solve for two things, making sure we're positioning ourselves to be able to consistently support our advisers even when the macro declined, so the economic cycle link. And then second, just making sure we're striking the right balance between preserving that balance sheet strength and investing for growth. Right? In our perspective in solving for those things, we think 1.5 to 2.5 times leverage is really something that positions us all to achieve those objectives. So that was the driver.\nWilliam Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Vogt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Most of mine have been answered already, but I just had a couple of follow-ups. Maybe one on the betas in terms of incremental betas, I know those increased to 20% over the last 75 basis points. But just wondering if you could provide some updated thoughts there on the trend for incremental betas as the Fed is now set to more -- to move more meaningfully above the peak of last cycle?\nMatthew Audette: Yes, Kyle. I mean I think the betas so far have been coming in favorable, right, as you highlighted. And the most recent hikes, we're at 20%. When you look at the last cycle, that would have peaked around 25% for us. They are coming in a little bit better. Our approach, though, here is -- and we'll continue to monitor it is to remain competitive, right? We've got a product that we want to be competitive in the marketplace. And I think that's what drives those betas. So I think we'll continue to price that way. I would say, just looking at the marketplace, we don't see anything pointing to a meaningful change in the price sensitivity of this particular product. So I think we'd be surprised if betas ended up being materially different than last time.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the leverage conversation just really more so on corporate cash. You built up your corporate cash balances to just over $400 million in the third quarter. And even when accounting for higher repurchases in 4Q, you're still very likely to build cash into the end of the year. I'm just wondering if there's a near-term preference to maintain higher cash balances than you have historically say, over the last 4 or 5 years in order to maintain kind of maximum flexibility on opportunistic M&A, is that a part of the decision-making there for running with higher cash balances.\nMatthew Audette: Well, I think it's back to our capital allocation framework. It's all about being prepared to take advantage of opportunities to invest in organic growth first, M&A second and returning capital to shareholders third. And I think the time, which each of those things emerges can be different, right? So I think what you see there is there's no -- nothing to infer about that cash balance build other than our economics improve pretty materially in the quarter, and we're going to allocate it the same way we have before. And our target for corporate cash hasn't changed at $200 million. So we're above that right now, but our target and objective will be to deploy it across our capital allocation framework.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Arnold for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And as a reminder, we're holding our Investor and Analyst Day in New York on November 16. We look forward to speaking with you then as we discuss our business in greater detail. Hope you have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we enhanced our sweep deposit program with the launch of the client cash account and onboarding people as you noted today. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the market. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1 trillion down 2% from Q2, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. Total net new assets were $20 billion or 7% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $13 billion, bringing our 12-month total to $84 billion. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher ICA balances and expenses led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $3.13. This was up 77% from a year ago, and is the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $838 million, up $127 million or 18% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $182 million, down $23 million from chip. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick and production bonus expense, and lower advisory fees following the Q2 equity market supply. Our payout rate for the quarter was 87.9%, up about 90 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding unit. Regarding asset base revenue, sponsor revenue was $194 million in Q3, down $14 million sequentially. The decrease in Q3 was driven by lower average assets during the quarter, as well as a non-recurring $8 million sponsor payment in Q2. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $304 million, up $147 million from Q2 driven by higher average short term interest rates as well as higher ICA balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, the end of the quarter at $67 billion, down $3 billion sequentially driven by client net buying activity of $20 million, which is the highest quarterly level we have ever seen. Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q3 as we saw further improvements in banks deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $7 billion. And I would highlight that $5 billion of that increase was a new fixed rate contracts. Looking more closely at our ICA yields, it was 212 basis points in Q3 up 78 basis points from Q2, primarily driven by the increase in short term rates during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q4 we expect your ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to increase to approximately 265 basis. As for service and fee revenue, it was $122 million in Q3, up $9 million from Q2, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRAP [ph]. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with roughly 4200 subscriptions, which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $34 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q4 results, we do not have any large advisor conferences in the quarter. We expect service and fee revenue to decline by roughly $5 million sequentially. Regarding Q3 transaction revenue, it was $43 million down $1 million sequentially as trading volumes declined. As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in training activity in October. That said, I would note there is one less trading day. So that would likely offset that. And so based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat we feel great. Turning now to expenses, Core G&A was $298 million in Q3 up $12 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to invest to drive growth. So while we expect to be within our full year 2022 Core G&A outlook range, we expect to be towards the higher end. As a result, we are tightening the outlook to a range of $1,185 million to $1,195 million. On Q3 promotional expense, it was $99 million up $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher conference expense because we hosted our largest advisor conference of the year, which returned to an in person format for the first time in three years. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect lower conference spend partially offset by continued growth and recruiting transition system. As a result, we expect promotional expense will decrease by approximately $15 million sequentially. With respect to depreciation and amortization, it was $52 million in Q3 up $3 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $33 million in Q3, up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increase the cost of our floating rate debt. Looking ahead to Q4 given where LIBOR rates are today, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $36 million. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q3 with corporate cash at $424 million, up $183 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio was 1.7 times down from 2.1 times in Q2. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power. As we look at our leverage ratio going forward, our balance sheet strategy is unchanged. Our focus is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can absorb a market downturn, while at the same time having the capacity to invest for growth. With our improved earnings power, we are updating our leverage target to a range of one and a half to two and a half times, which we believe positions us well to operate over a range of economic cycles, and strikes the right balance between preserving balance sheet strength and investing for growth. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $75 million of our shares. As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $150 million. This will complete our existing authorization of $1 billion that we established at the end of 2018. Looking to 2023, we work to put in place a new share repurchase authorization, our focus was on an amount that we'd be in a position to execute against over roughly two years. With that framing in mind, we established a new authorization of $2 billion, which we expect to begin executing in the first quarter of 2023. As always, we will retain the flexibility to adjust the pace to repurchases as the environment warrants or as other capital allocation opportunities across organic growth and M&A merge. In closing we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will ask our operator Amy to open the call for questions. Sure. I mean I think the core of it, as I talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks, is making sure that we're balancing having a strong balance sheet with deploying capital to drive growth. And I think when we think through the prioritization of that, it is focused on organic growth versus M&A second and then returning capital to shareholders third. And I think what you hear us saying on the $2 billion over two years that we think around $250 million. And I would emphasize roughly, right, roughly $250 million a quarter is that right allocation. Now if we get through a period of time over that two years, where interest rates are elevated for an extended period of time or there's just fewer opportunities to deploy capital towards organic growth or M&A., I would expect that pace to increase and for us to execute against faster. And I'd highlight, if the opposite occurs, we see more opportunities for organic growth and more opportunities for M&A that would expect it to slow down. So it's really just about the opportunities that we see, and we'll make those judgments along the way. No, you covered it up. Yes. Yes, it sounds good. I think it's mostly onboarded between the two of those. I'd call it in the $1.5 billion on that left to come on board. And that's on the direct side. So that takes a little bit longer for that process for those over, but $1.5 billion would be the right time. Yes. On that growth rate, I mean, I think when you look at the last few quarters there's been a few million a quarter on that depreciation and amortization growth, and that's primarily the tech portfolio, the capitalized piece that goes there. So I think that's a good framing to think about that. On the tech portfolio, the capitalization versus expense rate, it moves around depending on the type of work that we're doing in that particular quarter. But I think a good rule of thumb is 70% capitalized 30% expense. So I hope that color helps. You've got kind of the structural trend towards advisory that still exists to a little bit of an environmental influence over the [indiscernible]. Sure, Ben. I'll give -- it's a little early. I'll give you some color. I mean, I think when we think about -- to your point on interest rates and how that impacts our financials, when we do those economies, just building from the start of the cycle, right, early in the cycle, we were focused on that, the benefit from those increases falling to the bottom line and really improving margin, right? And then as we got deeper into the cycle, really pivoting to our capital allocation framework and allocating that capital across the 3 primary areas that we look at. And I think investments to drive and support organic growth is the primary category, the first category that we look at. And as you highlighted a bit when we look at this year, right, we've been accelerating investments to drive growth and support our advisers. And just looking at Core G&A, we've typically been in the mid-to-single -- mid-single-digit growth rates in the past. And this year, we'll be in the 12% to 13% range, right? And part of that increase is coming from those incremental earnings from rates that we're really deploying to improve our value competition. Now when we look across the other options, right, we see opportunities potentially in M&A, right? We see opportunities in returning capital to shareholders that we've talked about today, increasing the buyback in Q4 at $150 million and then pivoting to a $250 million -- roughly $250 million per quarter next year. Now on the level of investments next year, I think if the interest rate environment does play out like it's predicted, I think we're going to be in a position to have opportunities to invest and drive growth, and we'll apply the same framework on the capital allocation front that we always use to guide us. And I'll share a bit more color at Investor Day in a few weeks, and then we'll finalize those plans as we normally do and share them on our year-end earnings call. Yes. Yes. It's definitely operational. I think that the best things to look at are the history, the empirical data that you were referring to. I think an average of 5% is where we've been. So you think of that as maybe a market neutral position and the lows have gone down closer to 4%. But keep in mind, our mix of assets were different back then. They were more in brokerage than they are today. And advisory in general, will have a higher amount of cash to facilitate rebalance. So maybe that low end -- would that mix change, that low end feels more like 4.5% given that mix change. And I think you're right, where we're sitting today in that 6.5% zone is certainly towards the upper end. So that's the range that I would have. Yes, Bill, and good to hear. Good to hear from you again. Welcome back. I think our target range remains at 50% to 75% in a rolling portfolio. So we're minimizing that interest rate volatility. And I think we're in periods of low rates, we'd want to stay closer to that 50% in periods of higher rates like we're getting into now, where there's also some steepness to the curve, I think we'd want to be closer to 75% -- and our ability to do that really is subject to the demand in the market, right? So maybe just a little bit of color on what we're seeing there is demand does continue to return, right? On ICA overall, right. We added $7 billion of balances in Q3, the majority of that $5 billion in fixed, and that brings the amount we've been able to add this year of new fixed to $9 billion, right? And that's the most we've been able to add in a single year ever, meaning even pre-COVID. So the environment is certainly improving. And then when you look at from this point forward, it does feel like that it's set up more demand to continue to be strong. Right, from the Fed side of raising rates and really shrinking their balance sheet to the banks themselves, where consumer spending continues to remain healthy. Loan balances are growing. And those are all the things that would lead to additional demand. Now whether that's fixed or not becomes more about those banks and what their asset liability management is and their interest in FX. So it becomes a little bit more challenging to take all that information and say that there'll be more fixed in -- but I feel confident overall that the environment is conducive to banks needing more ICA. And what we've seen so far has been approved. So we'll keep monitoring. But I think if the demand is there, we'll want to manage that 50% to 75% range we've talked through, which even though we've improved, we're still below the low end of that today. Yes. Yes, of course. So I think when we look at our strategy, right, which is unchanged, right? It's really focused on a combination of maintaining a strong balance sheet and having capacity to invest for growth. And the driver of the decline in the leverage ratio has really been our earnings power improving, right? Our growth, combined with the interest rate environment has driven the leverage ratio down. So given that and given -- and thinking about what our target leverage ratio should be, we wanted to solve for two things, making sure we're positioning ourselves to be able to consistently support our advisers even when the macro declined, so the economic cycle link. And then second, just making sure we're striking the right balance between preserving that balance sheet strength and investing for growth. Right? In our perspective in solving for those things, we think 1.5 to 2.5 times leverage is really something that positions us all to achieve those objectives. So that was the driver. Yes, Kyle. I mean I think the betas so far have been coming in favorable, right, as you highlighted. And the most recent hikes, we're at 20%. When you look at the last cycle, that would have peaked around 25% for us. They are coming in a little bit better. Our approach, though, here is -- and we'll continue to monitor it is to remain competitive, right? We've got a product that we want to be competitive in the marketplace. And I think that's what drives those betas. So I think we'll continue to price that way. I would say, just looking at the marketplace, we don't see anything pointing to a meaningful change in the price sensitivity of this particular product. So I think we'd be surprised if betas ended up being materially different than last time. Well, I think it's back to our capital allocation framework. It's all about being prepared to take advantage of opportunities to invest in organic growth first, M&A second and returning capital to shareholders third. And I think the time, which each of those things emerges can be different, right? So I think what you see there is there's no -- nothing to infer about that cash balance build other than our economics improve pretty materially in the quarter, and we're going to allocate it the same way we have before. And our target for corporate cash hasn't changed at $200 million. So we're above that right now, but our target and objective will be to deploy it across our capital allocation framework."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Amy. And thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, amid persistent market volatility, our advisors continued to be a source of support and guidance for their clients by helping them navigate uncertainty. This commitment to their clients underscores the importance of our work on our mission, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. With respect to our performance, third quarter was marked resilient business results which drove solid financial out, as well as continued progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business. In the third quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Third quarter net new assets were $20 billion, representing 7% annualized just contributed to net new assets over the past 12 months of $101 billion, representing 9% organic revenue. Looking at recruited assets, they were $13 billion in Q3, bringing our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion. These results were driven by the on-going enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, against the backdrop of continued market volatility, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with this combination with existing market, combination which drove improvement in same-store sales in the third quarter. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the on-going modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter, and 98% over the past 12-months. Our third quarter business results lead to solid financial outcomes of $3.13 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 77% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire advisor center market, which for us, means being the best at empowering advisors and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. For bringing this vision to life, we're providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients, at the same time through human driven technology enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisors in their efforts, the extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisory experience organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we've organized our work into four strategic planning plays, which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses, by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our adjustable model. A recruiting in traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q3, with approximately $6 billion in assets. We continue to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, despite advisor movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. Following several quarters of elevated market volatility, advisors are acclimating to the conditions and increasingly exploring new strategic alternatives for their practice. This creates a more favorable scenario for us as market driven headwinds give way to the structural strength per model. This should result in a solid finish to the year from a recruiting team. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employees and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in the quarter and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models. With respect to large financial institutions, over the past two quarters, we onboarded two new clients, CUNA and People's United. We continue to learn from each experience and use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LTL, and in turn, helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in the practices. A particular area of focus is helping our advisors create a digital experience for their clients. It's personalized for their practice. As an example, this quarter we extended the flexibility our advisors have and how they utilize their brand, and the optionality of the content and features they present to their clients. In addition, we're always looking for opportunities to arm our advisors and in clients with expanded tools, products and services to navigate markets. To that end, we continue to build out our research capabilities in terms of content and subject matter expertise. We've also increased our focus on certain products like annuities and alternative investments, which are in higher demand in this market. To that end, we're working on making it easier and more efficient for advisors to provide these products, also expanding the breadth of solutions available to meet the client's needs. These enhancements help advisors broaden their value proposition and enrich the offering they provide to their clients, which further contributes to the appeal of our platform, both existing and prospective deposits. Well, let's next move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an end-to-end client care model. And we think about this journey through two primary lenses, transforming our service interface, and reimagining the operational processing that takes place behind that. Aspiration is provide advisors a multichannel experience, across voice, chat, digital first support, thus offering them greater flexibility for when and how they access service. While we continue to fine tune each of these three channels, we're currently focused on our digital first report, we see it as an opportunity to create an easier and more efficient experience for our advisors to access the information they need. And as we expand these capabilities, advisors can increasingly engage more and more digitally to resolve their requests. And many have already shared they prefer the simpler option over making a phone call. While we're still in the early innings, we believe these enhancements will have a meaningful impact scalability of our platform, while also enhancing the client experience. Our four strategic players focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisors and institutions run thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. We're encouraged by the seasoning of this business and our value proposition continues to resonate with advisors. Four years ago, we started our service group with a strategic goal of solving the practice level challenges advisors face, so they can spend more time with the client. Through ongoing innovation and expansion, these efforts have translated into the comprehensive portfolio of services we offer today. And as a result of growing demand, our services group subscription base continued to increase, ending the period at roughly 4200 and generating run rate revenue of $34 million. As we work with advisors on existing services, we continue to identify and solve for new needs on their behalf. One example is the launch of our latest solution bookkeeping services. And based on insights from CFO solutions, we created a new service to help advisors further streamline the business decisions with accurate and timely financial reports. As a result, advisors can spend more time growing and managing their business or also tracking profits in closing. Looking at our innovation pipeline for the remainder of the year, we have several services in pilot and others in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our portfolio, better support our advisors and to drive growth. In summary, in the third quarter, we continue to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, I have long-term shareholder that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. So Steven thanks for the question. And as Matt said, when you think about that allocation of capital, we obviously prioritize that to organic ours. And then we look to M&A as a complement to that organic growth. And I think as we've said before, there's two key areas. We continue to explore and look to the M&A marketplace for and that's to enhance or speed up capabilities that we deliver and make available to our advisers and/or 1 that contributes to our overall growth. And I think with respect to that second category, we continue to look through the entire ecosystem from smaller growth-oriented deals like the binding scattered good ample that you saw us do in the second quarter all the way up to if there were a more opportunistic opportunity to create value, deploy our capital in a way that makes sense relative to other options and alternatives that operationally, we can consume that acquisition and execute on it well fits inside our strategy, then we would be interested in certainly exploring those opportunities in. So I don't think our posture has changed at all relative to our strategy and how we think about using and leveraging M&A. Certainly, we get your point around how the market may -- and conditions in the market may change that may make those acquisition opportunities more right for available. And again, we stay consistent in our exploration of the market, looking at where we can complement our [indiscernible]. So I hope that helps. Yes, let me start, then Matt you can you can add to that a compliment that. It's a sort of question. It's a great question. So I think, look, we would look across two different, obvious landscapes. One would be, how do we continue to create capabilities that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Think about anything across the spectrum of our wealth management platforms and offerings, the more that we can automate from that the advisory platforms expand the content. In terms of investment options, alternatives, we continue to invest significantly in our centrally managed platform, turning that into a really interesting and competitive UMA platform. Those are examples of where we would think about added capabilities that I think continue to help our advisors differentiate when other great examples of that are in our financial planning capabilities. That's where planning comes in and tax planning overlays, etcetera or again, other places, we, we believe the advisors can show up in the marketplace with a broadening and compelling value proposition. So that's just one example of where we would focus. Again, the second one would be in this area of how do we help them run better businesses. And anything that we can do that, that makes them more effective at making better decisions, and really understanding what's happening in their businesses. So using data turned into analytics to create better decision making, creating leverage points and expertise, whether that be like, our CMO marketing solution, as an example, our CFO solution, those are examples of where we would continue to invest in capability and services. So you take that combination of technology and services combined, all for the purpose of helping them deliver better advice and differentiate by so that they win more, and then ultimately, to help them operate and run better businesses. That's where you should think about us celebrating and enhancing our overall spin model. Think at the same time. Look, we continue to explore how do we expand and evolve our affiliation models such that, you extend your addressable market, you actually create more and more flexibility and optionality for how that advisor may plug into our platform, or may evolve, how they use our platform over time, we think are really compelling and interesting places to continue to invest. So those are just a couple of examples of how we might think about deploying into our overall capability set that would drive new store sales, same store sales and -- all of which would obviously contribute towards the end of [Indiscernible]. Matt, I don't know if you want to add? Yes, we're definitely seeing demand leading, leading to those spreads. So maybe just to walk back kind of pre-COVID. I think we landed in a zone where we would typically be able to get Fed funds plus 20, maybe 25. And then during COVID, if you were if you're lucky enough to get it as usually said, funds minus, and then and I think we lived in a place of round Fed Funds flat as we know, probably the last year or so. And then I think what we're seeing right now and even the new variable contracts that we're putting in place right now we're at a spread of, plus 5 to 10. Right, so you're starting to see things come back and I think I don't I don't see anything just think that the book ended where we were with free code that plus 20 to 25. I think that's a good place to point to on where we think it would go. But I think the trend is a positive one. And we're seeing it each quarter including this quarter with that plus 5 to 10. Yes. Let me take that. Or, Matt, you want to start with this, what's outstanding in terms of the balances to transition the unit? And then I'll pick up? And then maybe for the second part of your question. So look, we continue to see these financial institutions as an affiliation model that we believe has ongoing growth opportunity. And I think we selectively added roughly $65 billion, $70 billion in large financial institution assets over the last couple of years and continue to see strong momentum in the demand for the solution of the offering, which really just sort of introduced a new concept into an outsourcing model sort of scale into the marketplace, right? So all the value proposition that we've talked about originally, everything from the risk management profile shift all the way to better client experiences attracting better advise or better financial results all still hold. And I think what we've done over the last couple of years is as we've added these larger institutions, we continue to innovate both in terms of how we support them day in and day out. And also this is partly how you transition them over. That's a pretty big change management effort as you could imagine. And I think given that over the last couple of years, we continue to make our model more and more appealing. So as we talk to future prospects. I think we're able to continue to expand the value, which we provide and deliver for them, the quality at which we do it and simplify the change management effort in the overall transition. So with that, momentum that we have matched with the improvement in enhancing value proposition, we believe and are still very optimistic in the sort of growing durability around the growth opportunity and have a good solid pipeline. And though these deals are a little bit harder to predict in terms of the timing because they're longer sales cycle, feel good that we have opportunity to continue the momentum. Yes. So short answer is we are seeing some mix. I think you're right in assessing that it's very much sort of environmentally driven by the macro market conditions. Fixed income is a good example of that. I think you're also seeing it in the alt space and in annuities. And those drive a higher mix of perhaps deploying capital to new solutions in a kind of a time-bound way relative to the market conditions. I think you've also seen it show up in a bit of a slowdown in some of the transition from brokerage to advisory. In the short run as well, we think that structural trend still makes sense and still expect that to continue. I just think you have a little bit of that sort of environmental noise overlay. So I think those are the right way to think about slight mix. If you look at our overall macro trend that we still expect to see much more assets deployed to advisories which is for all the structural reasons that we've talked about before. And I think you'll see that we still sit in sort of that 52% to 53% range of assets now in advisory, and that probably hasn't continued to trend up as much as we would have expected, a little bit because of the macro, probably more because of some of the larger bank or enterprise solutions that we brought on, just have a higher mix of brokerage assets than typically independent advisers that we recruit new. But we do expect once they get on to our platform and have new capabilities and access to perhaps better advisory tools, they typically begin to also see a trend or a transition of their books over time from brokerage to advisory. Yes. Yes. Yes. Devin, you said it, and we've talked about it, the macro conditions certainly can create some headwinds across new store sales or recruiting as we've talked about, right, the complexity in the marketplace drives focus on serving and supporting their clients in the short term, rightfully so and sometimes then delayed more strategic considerations. So I think we saw certainly a pickup in the third quarter as we talked about some of those market-driven headwinds beginning to give way to the structural desire of an adviser to improve their practice or their programs. And so we feel great about our pipeline across all of the different affiliation models that we have, certainly are traditional one as well as in the new models that we've created -- and so as we go forward, we feel like, certainly, as these advisers pivot back to focusing on structurally enhancing the program that aligns well with the feel and capabilities if our model sets up well for a good strong finish to the year from a recruiting standpoint. And again, I think you've seen it over the RIA channel the employee channel and the strategic wealth channel, right, those new models, we've consistently recruited a little over 2 billion each of the last three quarters. And so we feel good about going afield positioning in the marketplace for those as a great complement to our traditional markets. And then when you overlay the financial institution market over the top, it sets up for continued interesting evolution of our new store sales. And we continue to focus on trying to drive that higher as we go forward. I think if you look at the trailing 12, we've got about 84 billion in recruited results and outcomes, and we continue to work both on our efficacy to execute better, met with more appealing model met with the breadth of affiliation models to continue to drive that buying [ph]. Hope that answers... Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And as a reminder, we're holding our Investor and Analyst Day in New York on November 16. We look forward to speaking with you then as we discuss our business in greater detail. Hope you have a great day."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their performance. Amid persistent market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, our advisers reinforce the value they provide to the clients by helping them navigate in times of uncertainty. In that spirit, I want to recognize our advisers for their continued care and dedication to their clients, especially when they need it most. With respect to our performance, our second quarter business results led to solid financial outlook. At the same time, we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Second quarter net new assets were $37 billion which included $25 billion from CUNA and represented 13% annualized growth. These quarterly results contributed to a 10% organic growth rate for the past 12 months. Looking at recruited assets, they were $44 billion in Q2, included $32 billion from CUNA. This brought our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion which was up $4 billion from the same period a year ago. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. And while market volatility led some clients to moderate activity in the quarter, periods of heightened uncertainty are often in the environments that reinforce the value of professional advice and with time and serve as a catalyst for advisers to grow their products. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past 12 months. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $2.24 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition, an increase of 21% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire advisor-centered market which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Our recruiting and traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q2 with approximately $9 billion in assets. We continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, notwithstanding a broader slowdown in adviser movement over the past couple of quarters. Historically, during the initial stages of elevated market volatility, advisers often focus on supporting existing clients and may pause in making strategic decisions like switching firms. However, after advisers have acclimated to the conditions, they will often use times like this to consider new options for their practice, likely creating an opportunity for us from a recruiting standpoint. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models. Second quarter saw a new high for recruited assets in our employee model as the value proposition for advisers has proven to be compelling. As a complement to our organic growth, we recently announced the acquisition of the Private Client Group business at Boenning and Scattergood which we will onboard to our employee model early next year. With respect to large financial institutions, we onboarded CUNA in May and we are on track to onboard People's United later this year. We continue to learn from each experience to use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LPL and in turn helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we expect to continue winning in this market as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As a part of that focus, we continue to enhance ClientWorks, our core operating platform with the expansion of digitized workflows. For example, in the second quarter, we introduced enhancements to our Move Money solution which makes it easier and more automated for advisers to support deposits and withdrawals within client accounts. Separately, we also enhanced the client management workflow for advisory by integrating gold planning data into our Meeting Manager solution which facilitates more efficient preparation for and more value-added dialogue within client reviews. These enhancements help advisers operate more effectively and increase their scalability to serve more clients. Let's next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pyramid which includes voice, chat and digital support, thus giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for advisers. As part of the next phase of our transformation, we continue to expand and enrich our digital processing capabilities in order to provide greater flexibility, speed and accuracy for our advisers. Our transformation efforts are currently focused on four clearing functions, including money movement, account opening and account transfer which collectively drive the majority of our operational process. And while we remain early in these efforts, we are seeing solid progress as we are now processing millions of transactions for our advisers through the applications of robotics and AI. By expanding the automation of these critical processes, we continue to increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform while also enhancing the client experience. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. In the second quarter, our subscription base ended the period at nearly 3,900 with sequential growth moderating slightly in the wake of macro volatility. As we work with advisers on existing services, we continue to identify new needs we can solve for on their behalf which is a catalyst for further innovation that expands the value proposition of our existing services and services opportunities for new services. One example relates to how former Waddell & Reed advisers utilized our Admin Solutions on an interim basis to help them during the onboarding process. And based on that insight, we created a set of solutions for shorter-term engagement with our services to solve for a specific need in time for advisers. And we are testing some of these with CUNA advisers as they transition to our platform. Looking at our pipeline for the second half of the year, we have several services in pilot and other offerings in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio better support our advisers and drive growth. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the volatile market background, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we progressed the work to enhance our suite program utilizing free credits to create the client cash account. Substantially completed the integration of Waddell & Reed, signed an agreement to acquire Boenning and Scattergood, onboarded CUNA and are preparing to onboard People's United. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now, let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, down 8% from Q1 as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $37 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate. Looking more closely at recruiting, Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $44 billion which included $32 million from CUNA. These results brought our 12-month total to $84 billion. Now, let's turn to our Q2 financials. The combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher client cash balances and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $2.24. This was up 21% from a year ago and is the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $711 million, up $42 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $205 million, down $22 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production bonuses and lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline. In Q2, our payout rate was 87%, up about 90 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to roughly 88%, driven by the typical seasonal build in the production bonus as well as the onboarding of CUNA. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenue was $208 million in Q2, down $4 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter, driven by lower equity. This was partially offset by an $8 million payment from a sponsor related to higher period activity. Turning to client cash revenue, it was $156 million, up $71 million from Q1. This was driven by higher client cash balance as well as higher average short-term interest rates. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were up in the period, ending the quarter at $70 billion. Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q2 as we saw further improvements in bank deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $8 billion, of which $3 billion are fixed rate and $5 billion are floating rate. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 134 basis points in Q2, up 32 basis points from Q1, primarily driven by the increase in the fed funds rate during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect our ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today and our historical data, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to increase to approximately 195 basis points. Before moving on, I want to highlight that we updated our reporting of client cash balances. As we prepare for the introduction of the client cash account as our primary suite overflow vehicle, we have updated our cash reporting to include these balances. In addition, purchased money market fund balances have been relocated to the endnotes of our release. The historical data reflecting these changes is available in our historical information file. Now, let's turn to service and fee revenue which in Q2 was $113 million, unchanged from Q1. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with nearly 3,900 subscriptions which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $32 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by roughly $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRA. Moving on to Q2 transaction, it was $44 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, volumes in July have seasonally declined which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $10 million from Q2. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $286 million in Q2. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. Given the increase in interest rates to date, including the rate hike last week, we are poised to generate significant additional capital. Our framework for allocating this capital remains aligned with the returns we generate which first and foremost, is investments to drive and support organic growth. Now that we are deeper into the rate cycle, we plan to accelerate some of these investments and anticipate up to $20 million of additional core G&A in 2022. This increases our 2022 core G&A outlook to a range of $1.170 billion to $1.195 billion. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense, it was $84 million, down $4 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense will increase to approximately $105 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we hosted our largest adviser conference of the year last week which returned to an in-person format for the first time in three years. Now, let's move to Waddell and Reed. In total, we onboarded over $70 billion as 99% of client assets joined our platform. We generated EBITDA of roughly $21 million in Q2 or $85 million on an annualized basis. At the end of the quarter, the run rate EBITDA benefit was approximately $100 million, bringing our estimated purchase multiple to 4.5x. As we have now substantially completed the integration, going forward, we will no longer break out their stand-alone results. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $48 million in Q2, up $3 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by up to $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $29 million in Q2, up $2 million sequentially, as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating debt. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $33 million, primarily driven by the increase in LIBOR. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q2, with a leverage ratio at 2.1x and corporate cash of $241 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we get, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q3, given our improved level of cash generation, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $75 million. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: So Matt, maybe we\u2019ll just start off with some of the cash sweep dynamics. In one of the slides you guys referenced that the deposit betas on subsequent hikes beyond 100 basis points or running a little bit lower than what you experienced, I guess, in the last cycle. I guess just curious to get your thoughts on why that is. Is it just the pace of rate hikes has been too fast and we\u2019re going to likely play a little bit of a catch-up? Or do you think there\u2019s a reason to believe that, that\u2019s more sustainable? And maybe just as a follow-up to that, would love a comment on appetite for additional fixed duration as we saw you guys have done in the quarter?\nMatt Audette: Sure, Alex. I think the -- maybe the operative point on that slide, the primary point on that slide is the betas in the prior cycle. I think we are just given how much cash is in the system, it's not a surprise to me that the betas so far have been a little bit better but I would just emphasize a little bit. So I think the center of gravity and where pricing in the product is probably in the zone of last time which just highlights it's not really a rate-sensitive product. On your second question on fixed, right? I think our objective and goals here remain the same that I think you've heard for quite some time which is to get into a range of 50% to 75% of the portfolio on the fixed rate side. And I think the primary driver on our ability to do that is really demand coming back. So if you look at where we ended the quarter even though we added some fixed rates because of the growth that we had, we're at about 25% of the portfolio. And I think what -- when you think about the demand that came back in the market, it's really starting to build up quite well with us being able to add $8 billion of balances in the quarter, there was more demand on the variable rate side, right? So about $5 billion of that came on the variable rate side. But the $3 billion on the fixed rate side, that was the most that we put in place in quite some time, probably since the pandemic began. So I think it's encouraging to see. And as we look ahead, it's going to be really about is the additional demand on the fixed rate side there. And the environment, I think, is conducive in general to that, whether it's the fed continuing to raise rates or probably more importantly, shrinking their balance sheet and taking cash out of the system to the consumer side where consumer spending remains healthy, loan balances are growing. Those are all things that ultimately would lead to sweep demand overall and then ultimately, I think, some fixed rate management.\nAlex Blostein: Great. And just maybe for my second question around organic growth. Obviously and again, perhaps not surprisingly, with more volatility, we\u2019ve seen moderation in organic growth across the industry in terms of just net new assets. As you were to unpack that a bit and think about sort of the slightly lower run rate ex the larger transactions that we\u2019ve seen from you guys, how much of that is coming from just slower same-store sales versus lower recruiting versus some retention dynamics? Just would love to get a little more color on that as we think on the forward organic growth rate opportunity for the firm as a whole.\nDan Arnold: I'll take that one, Alex. And look, I think if you look at the quarter more closely, right, we saw solid new store activities. And if you look across our traditional markets, the new models ex the large institution, you saw a good robust activity with some slowing relative to prior quarters in new store sales as we believe more to do with just that macro backdrop as we talked about. And I think, as advisers pivot through that and get a bit more estimated to that environment and then begin to look forward, again, these types of conditions are usually an opportunity for us as we believe there will be more demand, if you will, to explore looking at more options and alternatives. And so, I think you\u2019ve seen just a little sluggish in news for sales which is more backed up with the environment. The retention levels have remained as we pointed out, that 2% range in the past year to two years, we feel good about where that is and that\u2019s at the lower end of kind of our target range. And so I haven\u2019t seen much variability there through the period. And then, same-store sales is where you see most of the headwind. Of course, this quarter, you have the April dynamic of tax payments that are a headwind on April. And then you saw the equity market volatile and moved down much of the quarter. We saw a real sluggishness in April. And we saw some same-store sales be back up in May slightly with the market and then June, it returned to a headwind. At our conference last week, I think in the dialogue with advisers, you\u2019re beginning to hear those advisers get to a place, I think, in this period where they\u2019re beginning to see more growth opportunities as they work through this period of volatility. And I think that\u2019s logical and normal as they see more opportunity to serve new clients who may not being served as well by other advisers. And that ends up being quite frankly, a stimulus and a structural opportunity to demonstrate value to differentiate when required. So a headwind in the second quarter, I do think that structurally speaking, we still see good opportunity as we go forward on same-store sales. But that\u2019s the biggest headwind in the short. Let me pause there. I hope that helps.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: First off, I just wanted to unpack a recent announcement that you guys made in hiring Bill Sappington. And I was hoping you could just speak to the decision around the new hire. It certainly sends a strong signal that you guys are focused on growing some of your banking and lending solutions. It is a sizable revenue opportunity. It\u2019s one that many of your peers have pursued. But just wanted to get a sense if you could help us frame the long-term revenue opportunity here, especially since your advisers haven\u2019t historically been strong users of that lending product.\nDan Arnold: Yes. This is Dan. Look, from a strategic standpoint, we're trying to, I think, solve for two opportunities. One, we hear our advisers with the appetite to broaden their value to their clients and provide more of what I might call a holistic approach to that overall advice spectrum. And so it's logical that we would think about bringing lending capabilities, cash management solutions and integrate those in as part of the client experience and to create those products and solutions to add value to the clients. And then, if you -- by solving that, you create economics around that and that certainly is appealing from a strategic standpoint. So that's really what we're solving for. I think what we did was go out to the marketplace and say, \"Hey, if we're going to do this right, let's go get the experience and the insight and the leadership to do that. We have been experimenting for a short period of time and just learning enough about it to probably ask smart questions and better identify where our opportunities were and then bring that leadership in to help us go operationalize and execute on that concept; so that's what we're doing. We think there's interesting possibilities to do that through good third-party partnerships that have tight integrations into the overall client experience and thus deliver compelling solutions to the end client via those advisers. So I hope that helps. That's our strategy.\nSteven Chubak: Great. And just for my follow-up, maybe just unpacking some of the rate commentary that you made earlier, Matt. Two things I wanted to clarify. First, have you seen any change in client behavior in July in terms of cash allocations? How much of that cash, if any, has gone back into the market? And secondarily, you gave a lot of helpful color around fixed rate contracts. I noted that you had termed out some in the quarter. I\u2019m just trying to gauge your sense of urgency there because the forward curve is pricing in cuts for next year. And there is some concern that if you still are running with a significant amount of floating rate ICA that the downside risk on cash sweep fees could be more acute if we do enter another easing patch.\nMatt Audette: Yes. I'll take the second one first, Steve. I think that what I'd emphasize on the fixed rate side is we're below our target range, right? So I think from our perspective, if there's availability in the marketplace for fixed rate, we're interested in doing that. And I think what's encouraging, as I said, Alex, right, having the ability to add $3 billion just this quarter is really the most amount we've been able to do in a quarter since the pandemic. So I think it's encouraging. But our perspective, I think, is in line with the premise of your question that we'd like to increase fixed rates from here. It's just all about whether it's available in the market. Now with respect to your first question, so balances in July. I think when you look at what you would typically see in the first month of the quarter, I'd just remind you that advisory fees are primarily charged or the -- or month one is the biggest month of the quarter. So that typically would reduce cash. But I think that was offset by the continued organic growth that we have as well as the volatility, at least in the first half of July. So those two things kind of netted off. And I'd say July cash balances were relatively flat. But I'd add that the mix improved, meaning we saw further demand or capacity on the ICA side. So ICA balances actually went up while the money market overflow went down. And maybe just to complete the July update, even though you didn't ask it, just give a little bit of color on the M&A front which has those same dynamics of advisory fees in the first month of the quarter as well as that choppy macro. And I think when you factor those things in July, it's looking like something that you would expect in that environment which is organic growth, call it, in the 4% zone. And that is prior to any additional CUNA onboarding which we have about $5 billion to go on the direct side of CUNA. So I hope that helps to give you a little [indiscernible].\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Just had a question on expenses. As we think about the moving pieces for this year but also into \u201823, I know probably to get any sort of guidance there. But I saw you increase the core G&A growth expense guidance here for \u201822, I think that implies around 10.5% growth to 13% growth for this year. So I guess, would you be surprised that, that level of growth persisted 13% growth for this year. So I guess, would you be surprised at that level of growth persisted into \u201823? And just any sort of help on the moving pieces as we kind of build our models out to \u201823 here just in terms of some of the moving pieces around expenses that are coming in to the run rate this year from some of the acquisitions as well as the large mandate wins and initiatives that you have going on, just in terms of helping us with the run rate impact as we think about a full year impact in \u201823? But at the same time, I imagine there are some synergies and some expenses that will be falling out. So just any help there would be appreciated.\nMatt Audette: Yes, sure, of course. I mean I think the key thing, I'll just start with the driver of the increase and specifically, where we are in the interest rate cycle. And I think you probably recall in the past few quarters, we talked about the economics of interest rates going up and our perspective on that which is really for that first 100 basis points or so increase that the benefits of that really having that fall to the bottom line and improve upon. And once we got beyond that, really looking to our capital allocation framework to drive those decisions. And sitting here now well above 100 basis points, I think we feel well positioned to really allocate capital across all three of our primary areas, including what you're asking about on the expense front. And I think when we look at how and where to allocate that, we do focus, first and foremost, on investments to really drive and support organic growth. And the investments that we've identified to accelerate into this year, that $20 million are really focused on that in areas that -- where we typically spend, like technology, capabilities, serving and supporting our advisers. We see opportunities in M&A. The Boenning and Scattergood is a good example of that, that we recently signed. And then, of course, returning capital to shareholders. And as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we plan to increase our buyback to $75 million, up from $50 million in this quarter. Now to your question about next year, right? I think what we'll do is really share our thinking on next year when we typically do which is when we get closer to the end of this year. But I'd just emphasize, we'll continue to apply our capital allocation framework to really drive how and where we allocate that capital. Really focused on making sure we remain flexible and can make decisions really at that time. So we'll give you an update then. And I would just highlight from a share repurchase standpoint with the $75 million planned for next quarter, we are getting close to completing our current authorization. So that's something that will naturally work to refresh with a new one and we'll also give you an update after we do that as well.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. And maybe just on the capital management front, the $75 million of buybacks you mentioned for the next quarter, should we expect that pace to be sort of sustained into the fourth quarter and beyond? How are you thinking about that? And then just more broadly on M&A, clearly, you saw the transaction announced in the quarter. I think it was an employee model. So I guess where else might M&A be additive to the platform at this point? And what sort of properties are you seeing out there? And how much time are you guys spending on that?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I mean I think on the M&A front, all about anything that can accelerate our strategy, whether it's -- when you look at the different types of M&A that we've done from our traditional markets to helping advance our entry into the new market on the technology side in advancing capabilities that we otherwise would have had to build. So, I think it goes -- all goes back to our strategy and whether it can advance that or not. And of course, if it\u2019s price that makes financial sense. And if it\u2019s a growth acquisition of operation, we\u2019re in a position to be able to bring it on to it. So I think that perspective is really that we\u2019ve had for a while is really the same. On share repurchases, I\u2019d just go back to what I said at answering the prior question, it\u2019s really about our framework and what the opportunities are to allocate capital. I think with where interest rates are, we do expect to have more capital to allocate and we\u2019ll be focused then on the opportunities we see on organic growth and M&A and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. So just depending on what the opportunities look like but if share repurchases make sense, we would allocate capital there. We\u2019ll just have to see what it looks like at the time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I\u2019d like to start with a follow-up to Steven and Alex\u2019s questions. So the floating rate ICA contracts, they\u2019re still being done at flat to fed funds. Matt, you indicated that demand was improving and we certainly saw that on the volume side this quarter. But when do you think that, that demand is going to translate into price as well, thinking back to the historical premium to fed fund rate that you typically get on the floating rate?\nMatt Audette: Sure, Brennan. I mean, I think -- remember, I think we'll back when it peaked, right? We -- I think the Fed funds -- the variable contracts were in the Fed funds of maybe plus 20 plus 25. And I think that was at the peak, right? So where we are now with just the amount of demand and volume, I would just emphasize was a big, big positive in the quarter. And moving from contracts that were Fed funds through Fed funds minus a couple of basis points to now starting to get some that are Fed funds plus even in the 5% range or so. It's been a pretty quick improvement. So it's hard to know if that trend continues. I just will say when you look at the marketplace and the factors that would drive demand just continue to be. So it would not surprise me from a balance standpoint if demand continued to increase. And whether the spreads go from the 5-ish [ph] zone that we just saw up to that 20%, 25% that we saw at the peak, that's harder to know but keep in mind with Fed funds at 225 to 250 [ph], the spread that we're talking about is a relatively small piece of the overall amount.\nBrennan Hawken: Sure, sure. And I didn\u2019t realize that you are seeing some small improvements in price. So that\u2019s certainly encouraging and it makes sense. On the other asset-based fees, Matt, I believe you flagged an $8 million payment related to prior period activity. Should we consider that to be onetime in nature? Or is there a reason why that might be recurring?\nMatt Audette: Yes. Its prior period related, so not recurring.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: First question, I just want to dig in a little bit more around if we can get some more flavor on just the pool of advisers in motion today. And what you're seeing both there and you touched a little bit, Matt, on kind of M&A properties. But just how that's been evolving in the current backdrop, if there's any affiliation model that people are gravitating to in this environment? And then whether in terms of just the strategy, whether people are seeking LPL out or if you're kind of aggressively proactively going after either M&A targets or recruiting. So we're hearing kind of two sides in the market. I know some people are having a lot of success as you are some aren't seeing much at all. So just love to get a little flavor for that.\nDan Arnold: Yes, Devin, let me take a stab at that and a couple of questions in there. If I don't get it all, please just circle back. So I think with respect to the opportunity set, I think you've heard us talked about for the good past year, there's been slower movement or less movement, if you will, than historical norms in the overall marketplace. And we've continued to expand our participation rate and grow our share during that period of time. And I think that's probably reflective of the second quarter as well that we just saw and we are very proactive in the marketplace across all different models, affiliation models in terms of making sure that we create awareness for the solutions that we have, the sort of horizontal expansion we've gone on with this multiple affiliation models. We want to make sure that people are aware of the different solutions and problems that we can help them solve for. And certainly, our ongoing investment in the vertical integration of our capabilities is making the model more and more appealing to advisers again in all different segments. And so we want to make sure that people are aware of that capability set within the base of innovation and the change that's going on. And the team has done a really good job, I think, of creating structure and using data and insights to go to the market in a smart way and a crisp way to tell that story in a consistent way. And so, we're very intentional about trying to be good at attracting new advisers and very intentional about constantly working on how can we improve and get better at that. So I think this combination of the capabilities that we've built matched with the growing efficacy of our ability to recruit is leading to that sort of consistent up and to the right kind of results related to our sales. And again, we see a really strong pipeline, notwithstanding what's going on in the marketplace, all of our models that is very encouraging. I think that the employee base solution that we have still retains the independent principles. We're seeing continuing to really resonate out in the marketplace as more and more people become aware of it, we understand the combination of value they get of preserving sort of that principles and most appealing attributes of the independent model. We think that's very interesting growth cost. I hope that helps.\nDevin Ryan: That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up here on the services business. And you mentioned there's some new services in pilot and incubation at the moment. I'm not sure if you can give any more detail on what those might look like or what buckets they fit into? And then, if you think about kind of the bigger picture as you continue to scale, is there room for pricing uplift, as it sounds like a lot of the advisers are getting a lot of value out of it and maybe arguably in underpricing some of the services. Or really, is it just more about the differentiation of that platform? And so it just helps growth and stickiness. Just love to get more color as kind of the longer-term vision.\nDan Arnold: Yes, it's a good question. And look, strategically, the hypothesis was, hey, there's real problems and challenges to help these advisers better operate their businesses that we could solve for in a more effective way and in a cheaper rate for them thus creating real alternatives and real appeal. And then, if you can then integrate them from an automation and a technology statement when I take the service human center investment technology around it, well, that would be a great way to not only create scalability and efficiency in the overall delivery of those services, i.e., do them for a lower cost but then again, improve and enhance the value of it. So, I think that's the journey we're on. That's the journey we're on with the first generation of solutions that we offer to the marketplace. I think Audette [ph], CFO, marketing as the professional services that started with. I think we continue to refine them and improve and enhance them that will give us potential pricing power in certain of those solutions and services or they continues to innovate on how you offer them to the marketplace and it could be that you turn those that holistic sort of CFO solution into different discrete solutions, think about bookkeeping there's a derivative effect that might have a lower price point but solved for unique need within the old CFO scope. And so there's another number of iterations that we can take to create product expansion that have different price points that actually make it more accessible and easier for us to serve a broader set of advisers. So you\u2019ve got both dynamics. It\u2019s product innovation needs, different positioning in the marketplace that will drive price points. And to your point, if you create more value, then you can also charge more historically consistent but valuable existing service. So I think all of those spectrum possibilities are there for us. We are heavily into the innovation and trying to learn and understand what problems or challenges we\u2019re hearing from advisers and then how we can turn that into a service. You mentioned some things that are in the incubation phase in or what I might call, pilot based -- bookkeeping is one of those that we think will be an interesting opportunity that we\u2019ll go to market later this year on and then we\u2019ve got another probably five or six that are in that incubation phase that would then logically would move to a pilot. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Maybe just sticking with the business solutions for a moment. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color or context around kind of the stickiness of the subscriptions and what those kind of renewal terms look like or how long the contracts are? Or anything to just give us some insight as to the longer-term kind of opportunity there?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So there's a variety of different solutions and services that are offered, right? So you have the professional services that I mentioned before, adding the CFO marketing business strategy, then you have some business solutions that we've created that are more like M&A solutions, our assurance plan, remote office, resilience plan and even now paraplanning as a solution. And so they're slightly different in the values that they create and they're slightly different than how an adviser may use them. And so they're distinctively different than they have when you think about contracts and things of that nature. But if you take the professional services, generally speaking, that's a one year contract to start that typically speaking, we have done that as a way to present it to the marketplace to make sure that it's not a longer-term commitment as people got acclimated service, understood whether the added value to them or not but then gave us enough time, i.e., a year to make sure that they hadn't informed you and had used it enough to really understand whether it created value for them or not. And I think you have high retention rates on those different types of services. We're also though learning into the marketplace, as I said in my remarks. We saw some advisers that moved over from Waddell & Reed on our admin services that used those for a shorter time frame, I think their intent was to say, \"Hey, I just want these to help me transition over to LPL. So their vision was just one term on that contract and then ultimately would find a different long-term solution. So that's a good learning for us and an opportunity to innovate around that and create a different type of solution or shorter-term specific need in time. There might have a higher price associated with it but still create that value that they need for that short period of time. So that was a good example in learning where you might have had higher attrition rates on the surface of the admin services for that period of time but it was more related to how they were using the service, then it's satisfactory. So again, I think as we innovate on these portfolio and we offer them to the marketplace, we're seeing how people use them in different ways, it's a good learning experience and evolution for us in terms of making sure we fine-tune the value and that we -- they're well positioned in the marketplace to meet those specific needs of the advisers that are looking for help. So net out is, I think, high retention rates. And again, our opportunity is to continue to create awareness and to make sure that we expand that portfolio, so that we reach more advisers with a variety of different solutions that they need. And we think that there's a significant amount of value to be added. It also creates great stickiness and around that overall relationship with us and also has a residual knock-on effect of improving and enhancing the overall performance of the practice only high tailwind to same-store sales and higher retention rates that come along with those additional services as part of the relationship and even help us with new store sales as a differentiated more appealing model.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think around -- about this time last year, you kind of gave some color with respect to the RIA relaunch and sort of how that strategy was coming along, I guess, the sort of early days, maybe encouraging pipeline comments along those lines. But I think you also ended by saying you kind of need to go out and sell it. So hoping you might be able to give us a little bit of an update as to how that's coming along.\nDan Arnold: Yes, good question. And I think we -- that was like a year ago, we kind of relaunched, if you will, or went to the marketplace in a more offensive posture relative to our RIA offering. And we continue to go to the marketplace, looking for those opportunities for folks to leverage us as a vertically integrated strategic partner that are RIAs only. We continue to add capabilities and pricing that we believe is competitive and compelling and you\u2019re seeing that show up in the recruiting that we\u2019ve had over the past 12 months. That said, I think there\u2019s more that we can do and more opportunity and more -- we can be more intentional about how we go to the market and really establish ourselves as a differentiated strategic partner and a value-added partner and not just a custodian to RIAs. And so we have more to play there that you\u2019ll hear more about in the coming quarters.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe a follow-up question on capital management. Your current leverage ratio is roughly 2.1x which is towards the bottom end of your range, your targeted range. I guess when you consider that ratio is calculated using LTM at the rate sensitivity you\u2019ve disclosed, it\u2019s relatively easy to see how that leverage ratio can very quickly move below 1.5x without down any debt and still investing significantly in the business. I guess, how do you view your optimal leverage ratio in a period with rapidly growing EBITDA? And I guess, would you be willing to kind of let this trend significantly below your target as we look out this year?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Kyle. I think we're just starting with the range. I think the 2% to 2.75%, we think, is the right range to operate in. And it does a handful of things. But I think the balance sheet strength is key in supportive of recruiting and supporting our advisers that are with us. It's really, really important. And I think in addition to that, positioning us to have flexibility to deploy capital based on the opportunities that we see including M&A, investments in organic growth are important as well. And I think to the point of your question, I think as we get deeper into the interest rate cycle or even where we are right now, I think we feel comfortable and like being positioned on the lower end of that range as the interest rates get higher and higher and the amount of EBITDA that's driven by that -- by those economics is a larger percentage of it. I think if we end up dropping below the low end of that range and maybe I wouldn't say significantly to your question but maybe by a small amount for a short period of time, I think that's okay. I think our center of gravity and focus is being really deliberate and thoughtful about not only where we allocate that capital but when we allocate that capital. So I think that's our perspective. Overall, we want to allocate that capital to drive value and I think we feel good we're positioned today.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And as a follow-up on client cash, I appreciate the commentary on July but just a question on the idea of potential sorting and adviser behavior around client cash. Are you seeing any incremental signs of more yield-seeking behavior whether that\u2019s demand for money -- treasury or short duration fixed income instruments? And given that we\u2019ve just gotten the most recent [indiscernible] week and obviously acknowledging that\u2019s a very small size. Just wondering if there\u2019s been any change in behavior you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s been notable?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think I got your question, Kyle, it's breaking up there. But I think when you look at the right sensitivity of our cash and has anything changed? I think the answer is no. And I think just maybe a couple of reminders of the cash that we have in sweep on our business is largely operational. And that's why we tend to have some of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM in the industry where it's usually in the 5% zone. And the primary factor that tends to move that up and down is really market sentiment as opposed to rate-seeking behavior. And I think when you look at just the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, I think you're seeing that play out. Just looking at Q2 as interest rates have gone up meaningfully during the quarter, our cash balances actually grew both in dollars and as a percent of AUM, up to 6.5% just given the volatility that you saw in the quarter. So, I think the cash tends to be operational and even looking back at Q1, the last couple of quarters, I think you\u2019re seeing empirical data that really validates that the cash -- the rate-seeking behavior is really not on the cash that we have.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I wanted to come back to the pure RIA channel which you just relaunched a little more than a year ago. Can you provide us an update on how this channel is doing? And I was also interested in how the competitive landscape is evolving with both the merger of two of the biggest RIA custodians and also some changes to the macro backdrop year-to-date?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So I think with respect to the RIA business, look, the last two quarters, you've seen our affiliation models collectively, we've recruited in each of those quarters, a little over $2 billion in assets. And certainly, the RIA solution is a significant contributor to that. So again, we're seeing good traction with our offering in the marketplace today. As I shared with you, though, we see the opportunity to be a more significant vertically integrated strategic partner than just a custodian. And so that's one of the things that we're trying to be intentional about both in terms of how we think about our offering, our pricing and even potentially our branding of that offering. And so there's more to play out there that you'll hear more about as we go forward. But we do see the opportunity, given the size of that market to continue to win share there. I do think with the consolidation of two large custodians, that creates disruption or some potential change in the marketplace. And usually, where there's change, if they're well prepared, chance favors to prepare and you can capitalize on that opportunity. And so I think we certainly see that as one of the possibilities and opportunities amongst a number to win share as we go forward. So, I hope that helps give you a little bit more color and context on the opportunity we see and how we're trying to be intentional about capitalizing.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And I wanted to do my follow-up on the bank channel. So two big wins last year to this year with both CUNA and People\u2019s United coming shortly. What\u2019s the potential for additional bank channel wins? Can you keep the streak of two wins per year alive next year? And also, is the macro backdrop making it a little tougher to find the next win in just with banks focusing more internally right now?\nDan Arnold: Yes, good question. And so look, as we go forward, our pipeline continues to build across a larger spectrum of financial institutional clients. So I think it's that typical momentum where you have some success, you continue to iterate and all of your value proposition and that tends to create more dialogue and more opportunity. So we certainly see that demand picking up. And one of the biggest hurdles is just the whole onboarding change in a transition process. We continue to learn and apply those insights and new innovations, I'd like to say now make our onboarding and transition process, a differentiated capability. And that's one of the things that we saw as a big opportunity to reduce one of the barriers, if you will, of making that transition and the change. And so, we think that the track record of steady wins, the ongoing evolution and a feel of our model, smooth transitions is increasingly making us confident in the durability of this -- of the growth in this channel. So that maybe answers your first question. Your second question around the banks and their interest and their willingness to have this dialogue. Now I think the significant opportunity we have to add value across sort of a spectrum of economics needs risk management, needs operational efficiency, needs potential growth in their programs, notwithstanding the market volatility. There\u2019s a lot of reasons to have a dialogue and a discussion. And again, we see those opportunities to explore those possibilities continuing to evolve in a constructive well. So macro hasn\u2019t really altered the trajectory of this.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Arnold for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: I\u2019d just like to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the volatile market background, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we progressed the work to enhance our suite program utilizing free credits to create the client cash account. Substantially completed the integration of Waddell & Reed, signed an agreement to acquire Boenning and Scattergood, onboarded CUNA and are preparing to onboard People's United. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now, let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, down 8% from Q1 as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $37 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate. Looking more closely at recruiting, Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $44 billion which included $32 million from CUNA. These results brought our 12-month total to $84 billion. Now, let's turn to our Q2 financials. The combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher client cash balances and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $2.24. This was up 21% from a year ago and is the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $711 million, up $42 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $205 million, down $22 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production bonuses and lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline. In Q2, our payout rate was 87%, up about 90 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to roughly 88%, driven by the typical seasonal build in the production bonus as well as the onboarding of CUNA. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenue was $208 million in Q2, down $4 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter, driven by lower equity. This was partially offset by an $8 million payment from a sponsor related to higher period activity. Turning to client cash revenue, it was $156 million, up $71 million from Q1. This was driven by higher client cash balance as well as higher average short-term interest rates. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were up in the period, ending the quarter at $70 billion. Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q2 as we saw further improvements in bank deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $8 billion, of which $3 billion are fixed rate and $5 billion are floating rate. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 134 basis points in Q2, up 32 basis points from Q1, primarily driven by the increase in the fed funds rate during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect our ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today and our historical data, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to increase to approximately 195 basis points. Before moving on, I want to highlight that we updated our reporting of client cash balances. As we prepare for the introduction of the client cash account as our primary suite overflow vehicle, we have updated our cash reporting to include these balances. In addition, purchased money market fund balances have been relocated to the endnotes of our release. The historical data reflecting these changes is available in our historical information file. Now, let's turn to service and fee revenue which in Q2 was $113 million, unchanged from Q1. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with nearly 3,900 subscriptions which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $32 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by roughly $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRA. Moving on to Q2 transaction, it was $44 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, volumes in July have seasonally declined which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $10 million from Q2. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $286 million in Q2. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. Given the increase in interest rates to date, including the rate hike last week, we are poised to generate significant additional capital. Our framework for allocating this capital remains aligned with the returns we generate which first and foremost, is investments to drive and support organic growth. Now that we are deeper into the rate cycle, we plan to accelerate some of these investments and anticipate up to $20 million of additional core G&A in 2022. This increases our 2022 core G&A outlook to a range of $1.170 billion to $1.195 billion. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense, it was $84 million, down $4 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense will increase to approximately $105 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we hosted our largest adviser conference of the year last week which returned to an in-person format for the first time in three years. Now, let's move to Waddell and Reed. In total, we onboarded over $70 billion as 99% of client assets joined our platform. We generated EBITDA of roughly $21 million in Q2 or $85 million on an annualized basis. At the end of the quarter, the run rate EBITDA benefit was approximately $100 million, bringing our estimated purchase multiple to 4.5x. As we have now substantially completed the integration, going forward, we will no longer break out their stand-alone results. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $48 million in Q2, up $3 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by up to $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $29 million in Q2, up $2 million sequentially, as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating debt. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $33 million, primarily driven by the increase in LIBOR. Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q2, with a leverage ratio at 2.1x and corporate cash of $241 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we get, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q3, given our improved level of cash generation, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $75 million. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Sure, Alex. I think the -- maybe the operative point on that slide, the primary point on that slide is the betas in the prior cycle. I think we are just given how much cash is in the system, it's not a surprise to me that the betas so far have been a little bit better but I would just emphasize a little bit. So I think the center of gravity and where pricing in the product is probably in the zone of last time which just highlights it's not really a rate-sensitive product. On your second question on fixed, right? I think our objective and goals here remain the same that I think you've heard for quite some time which is to get into a range of 50% to 75% of the portfolio on the fixed rate side. And I think the primary driver on our ability to do that is really demand coming back. So if you look at where we ended the quarter even though we added some fixed rates because of the growth that we had, we're at about 25% of the portfolio. And I think what -- when you think about the demand that came back in the market, it's really starting to build up quite well with us being able to add $8 billion of balances in the quarter, there was more demand on the variable rate side, right? So about $5 billion of that came on the variable rate side. But the $3 billion on the fixed rate side, that was the most that we put in place in quite some time, probably since the pandemic began. So I think it's encouraging to see. And as we look ahead, it's going to be really about is the additional demand on the fixed rate side there. And the environment, I think, is conducive in general to that, whether it's the fed continuing to raise rates or probably more importantly, shrinking their balance sheet and taking cash out of the system to the consumer side where consumer spending remains healthy, loan balances are growing. Those are all things that ultimately would lead to sweep demand overall and then ultimately, I think, some fixed rate management. Yes. I'll take the second one first, Steve. I think that what I'd emphasize on the fixed rate side is we're below our target range, right? So I think from our perspective, if there's availability in the marketplace for fixed rate, we're interested in doing that. And I think what's encouraging, as I said, Alex, right, having the ability to add $3 billion just this quarter is really the most amount we've been able to do in a quarter since the pandemic. So I think it's encouraging. But our perspective, I think, is in line with the premise of your question that we'd like to increase fixed rates from here. It's just all about whether it's available in the market. Now with respect to your first question, so balances in July. I think when you look at what you would typically see in the first month of the quarter, I'd just remind you that advisory fees are primarily charged or the -- or month one is the biggest month of the quarter. So that typically would reduce cash. But I think that was offset by the continued organic growth that we have as well as the volatility, at least in the first half of July. So those two things kind of netted off. And I'd say July cash balances were relatively flat. But I'd add that the mix improved, meaning we saw further demand or capacity on the ICA side. So ICA balances actually went up while the money market overflow went down. And maybe just to complete the July update, even though you didn't ask it, just give a little bit of color on the M&A front which has those same dynamics of advisory fees in the first month of the quarter as well as that choppy macro. And I think when you factor those things in July, it's looking like something that you would expect in that environment which is organic growth, call it, in the 4% zone. And that is prior to any additional CUNA onboarding which we have about $5 billion to go on the direct side of CUNA. So I hope that helps to give you a little [indiscernible]. Yes, sure, of course. I mean I think the key thing, I'll just start with the driver of the increase and specifically, where we are in the interest rate cycle. And I think you probably recall in the past few quarters, we talked about the economics of interest rates going up and our perspective on that which is really for that first 100 basis points or so increase that the benefits of that really having that fall to the bottom line and improve upon. And once we got beyond that, really looking to our capital allocation framework to drive those decisions. And sitting here now well above 100 basis points, I think we feel well positioned to really allocate capital across all three of our primary areas, including what you're asking about on the expense front. And I think when we look at how and where to allocate that, we do focus, first and foremost, on investments to really drive and support organic growth. And the investments that we've identified to accelerate into this year, that $20 million are really focused on that in areas that -- where we typically spend, like technology, capabilities, serving and supporting our advisers. We see opportunities in M&A. The Boenning and Scattergood is a good example of that, that we recently signed. And then, of course, returning capital to shareholders. And as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we plan to increase our buyback to $75 million, up from $50 million in this quarter. Now to your question about next year, right? I think what we'll do is really share our thinking on next year when we typically do which is when we get closer to the end of this year. But I'd just emphasize, we'll continue to apply our capital allocation framework to really drive how and where we allocate that capital. Really focused on making sure we remain flexible and can make decisions really at that time. So we'll give you an update then. And I would just highlight from a share repurchase standpoint with the $75 million planned for next quarter, we are getting close to completing our current authorization. So that's something that will naturally work to refresh with a new one and we'll also give you an update after we do that as well. Yes. I mean I think on the M&A front, all about anything that can accelerate our strategy, whether it's -- when you look at the different types of M&A that we've done from our traditional markets to helping advance our entry into the new market on the technology side in advancing capabilities that we otherwise would have had to build. So, I think it goes -- all goes back to our strategy and whether it can advance that or not. And of course, if it's price that makes financial sense. And if it's a growth acquisition of operation, we're in a position to be able to bring it on to it. So I think that perspective is really that we've had for a while is really the same. On share repurchases, I'd just go back to what I said at answering the prior question, it's really about our framework and what the opportunities are to allocate capital. I think with where interest rates are, we do expect to have more capital to allocate and we'll be focused then on the opportunities we see on organic growth and M&A and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. So just depending on what the opportunities look like but if share repurchases make sense, we would allocate capital there. We'll just have to see what it looks like at the time. Sure, Brennan. I mean, I think -- remember, I think we'll back when it peaked, right? We -- I think the Fed funds -- the variable contracts were in the Fed funds of maybe plus 20 plus 25. And I think that was at the peak, right? So where we are now with just the amount of demand and volume, I would just emphasize was a big, big positive in the quarter. And moving from contracts that were Fed funds through Fed funds minus a couple of basis points to now starting to get some that are Fed funds plus even in the 5% range or so. It's been a pretty quick improvement. So it's hard to know if that trend continues. I just will say when you look at the marketplace and the factors that would drive demand just continue to be. So it would not surprise me from a balance standpoint if demand continued to increase. And whether the spreads go from the 5-ish [ph] zone that we just saw up to that 20%, 25% that we saw at the peak, that's harder to know but keep in mind with Fed funds at 225 to 250 [ph], the spread that we're talking about is a relatively small piece of the overall amount. Yes. Its prior period related, so not recurring. Yes, Kyle. I think we're just starting with the range. I think the 2% to 2.75%, we think, is the right range to operate in. And it does a handful of things. But I think the balance sheet strength is key in supportive of recruiting and supporting our advisers that are with us. It's really, really important. And I think in addition to that, positioning us to have flexibility to deploy capital based on the opportunities that we see including M&A, investments in organic growth are important as well. And I think to the point of your question, I think as we get deeper into the interest rate cycle or even where we are right now, I think we feel comfortable and like being positioned on the lower end of that range as the interest rates get higher and higher and the amount of EBITDA that's driven by that -- by those economics is a larger percentage of it. I think if we end up dropping below the low end of that range and maybe I wouldn't say significantly to your question but maybe by a small amount for a short period of time, I think that's okay. I think our center of gravity and focus is being really deliberate and thoughtful about not only where we allocate that capital but when we allocate that capital. So I think that's our perspective. Overall, we want to allocate that capital to drive value and I think we feel good we're positioned today. Yes. I think I got your question, Kyle, it's breaking up there. But I think when you look at the right sensitivity of our cash and has anything changed? I think the answer is no. And I think just maybe a couple of reminders of the cash that we have in sweep on our business is largely operational. And that's why we tend to have some of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM in the industry where it's usually in the 5% zone. And the primary factor that tends to move that up and down is really market sentiment as opposed to rate-seeking behavior. And I think when you look at just the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, I think you're seeing that play out. Just looking at Q2 as interest rates have gone up meaningfully during the quarter, our cash balances actually grew both in dollars and as a percent of AUM, up to 6.5% just given the volatility that you saw in the quarter. So, I think the cash tends to be operational and even looking back at Q1, the last couple of quarters, I think you're seeing empirical data that really validates that the cash -- the rate-seeking behavior is really not on the cash that we have."

            "content": "Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their performance. Amid persistent market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, our advisers reinforce the value they provide to the clients by helping them navigate in times of uncertainty. In that spirit, I want to recognize our advisers for their continued care and dedication to their clients, especially when they need it most. With respect to our performance, our second quarter business results led to solid financial outlook. At the same time, we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Second quarter net new assets were $37 billion which included $25 billion from CUNA and represented 13% annualized growth. These quarterly results contributed to a 10% organic growth rate for the past 12 months. Looking at recruited assets, they were $44 billion in Q2, included $32 billion from CUNA. This brought our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion which was up $4 billion from the same period a year ago. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. And while market volatility led some clients to moderate activity in the quarter, periods of heightened uncertainty are often in the environments that reinforce the value of professional advice and with time and serve as a catalyst for advisers to grow their products. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past 12 months. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $2.24 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition, an increase of 21% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire advisor-centered market which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Our recruiting and traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q2 with approximately $9 billion in assets. We continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, notwithstanding a broader slowdown in adviser movement over the past couple of quarters. Historically, during the initial stages of elevated market volatility, advisers often focus on supporting existing clients and may pause in making strategic decisions like switching firms. However, after advisers have acclimated to the conditions, they will often use times like this to consider new options for their practice, likely creating an opportunity for us from a recruiting standpoint. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models. Second quarter saw a new high for recruited assets in our employee model as the value proposition for advisers has proven to be compelling. As a complement to our organic growth, we recently announced the acquisition of the Private Client Group business at Boenning and Scattergood which we will onboard to our employee model early next year. With respect to large financial institutions, we onboarded CUNA in May and we are on track to onboard People's United later this year. We continue to learn from each experience to use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LPL and in turn helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we expect to continue winning in this market as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As a part of that focus, we continue to enhance ClientWorks, our core operating platform with the expansion of digitized workflows. For example, in the second quarter, we introduced enhancements to our Move Money solution which makes it easier and more automated for advisers to support deposits and withdrawals within client accounts. Separately, we also enhanced the client management workflow for advisory by integrating gold planning data into our Meeting Manager solution which facilitates more efficient preparation for and more value-added dialogue within client reviews. These enhancements help advisers operate more effectively and increase their scalability to serve more clients. Let's next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pyramid which includes voice, chat and digital support, thus giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for advisers. As part of the next phase of our transformation, we continue to expand and enrich our digital processing capabilities in order to provide greater flexibility, speed and accuracy for our advisers. Our transformation efforts are currently focused on four clearing functions, including money movement, account opening and account transfer which collectively drive the majority of our operational process. And while we remain early in these efforts, we are seeing solid progress as we are now processing millions of transactions for our advisers through the applications of robotics and AI. By expanding the automation of these critical processes, we continue to increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform while also enhancing the client experience. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. In the second quarter, our subscription base ended the period at nearly 3,900 with sequential growth moderating slightly in the wake of macro volatility. As we work with advisers on existing services, we continue to identify new needs we can solve for on their behalf which is a catalyst for further innovation that expands the value proposition of our existing services and services opportunities for new services. One example relates to how former Waddell & Reed advisers utilized our Admin Solutions on an interim basis to help them during the onboarding process. And based on that insight, we created a set of solutions for shorter-term engagement with our services to solve for a specific need in time for advisers. And we are testing some of these with CUNA advisers as they transition to our platform. Looking at our pipeline for the second half of the year, we have several services in pilot and other offerings in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio better support our advisers and drive growth. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. I'll take that one, Alex. And look, I think if you look at the quarter more closely, right, we saw solid new store activities. And if you look across our traditional markets, the new models ex the large institution, you saw a good robust activity with some slowing relative to prior quarters in new store sales as we believe more to do with just that macro backdrop as we talked about. And I think, as advisers pivot through that and get a bit more estimated to that environment and then begin to look forward, again, these types of conditions are usually an opportunity for us as we believe there will be more demand, if you will, to explore looking at more options and alternatives. And so, I think you've seen just a little sluggish in news for sales which is more backed up with the environment. The retention levels have remained as we pointed out, that 2% range in the past year to two years, we feel good about where that is and that's at the lower end of kind of our target range. And so I haven't seen much variability there through the period. And then, same-store sales is where you see most of the headwind. Of course, this quarter, you have the April dynamic of tax payments that are a headwind on April. And then you saw the equity market volatile and moved down much of the quarter. We saw a real sluggishness in April. And we saw some same-store sales be back up in May slightly with the market and then June, it returned to a headwind. At our conference last week, I think in the dialogue with advisers, you're beginning to hear those advisers get to a place, I think, in this period where they're beginning to see more growth opportunities as they work through this period of volatility. And I think that's logical and normal as they see more opportunity to serve new clients who may not being served as well by other advisers. And that ends up being quite frankly, a stimulus and a structural opportunity to demonstrate value to differentiate when required. So a headwind in the second quarter, I do think that structurally speaking, we still see good opportunity as we go forward on same-store sales. But that's the biggest headwind in the short. Let me pause there. I hope that helps. Yes. This is Dan. Look, from a strategic standpoint, we're trying to, I think, solve for two opportunities. One, we hear our advisers with the appetite to broaden their value to their clients and provide more of what I might call a holistic approach to that overall advice spectrum. And so it's logical that we would think about bringing lending capabilities, cash management solutions and integrate those in as part of the client experience and to create those products and solutions to add value to the clients. And then, if you -- by solving that, you create economics around that and that certainly is appealing from a strategic standpoint. So that's really what we're solving for. I think what we did was go out to the marketplace and say, \"Hey, if we're going to do this right, let's go get the experience and the insight and the leadership to do that. We have been experimenting for a short period of time and just learning enough about it to probably ask smart questions and better identify where our opportunities were and then bring that leadership in to help us go operationalize and execute on that concept; so that's what we're doing. We think there's interesting possibilities to do that through good third-party partnerships that have tight integrations into the overall client experience and thus deliver compelling solutions to the end client via those advisers. So I hope that helps. That's our strategy. Yes, Devin, let me take a stab at that and a couple of questions in there. If I don't get it all, please just circle back. So I think with respect to the opportunity set, I think you've heard us talked about for the good past year, there's been slower movement or less movement, if you will, than historical norms in the overall marketplace. And we've continued to expand our participation rate and grow our share during that period of time. And I think that's probably reflective of the second quarter as well that we just saw and we are very proactive in the marketplace across all different models, affiliation models in terms of making sure that we create awareness for the solutions that we have, the sort of horizontal expansion we've gone on with this multiple affiliation models. We want to make sure that people are aware of the different solutions and problems that we can help them solve for. And certainly, our ongoing investment in the vertical integration of our capabilities is making the model more and more appealing to advisers again in all different segments. And so we want to make sure that people are aware of that capability set within the base of innovation and the change that's going on. And the team has done a really good job, I think, of creating structure and using data and insights to go to the market in a smart way and a crisp way to tell that story in a consistent way. And so, we're very intentional about trying to be good at attracting new advisers and very intentional about constantly working on how can we improve and get better at that. So I think this combination of the capabilities that we've built matched with the growing efficacy of our ability to recruit is leading to that sort of consistent up and to the right kind of results related to our sales. And again, we see a really strong pipeline, notwithstanding what's going on in the marketplace, all of our models that is very encouraging. I think that the employee base solution that we have still retains the independent principles. We're seeing continuing to really resonate out in the marketplace as more and more people become aware of it, we understand the combination of value they get of preserving sort of that principles and most appealing attributes of the independent model. We think that's very interesting growth cost. I hope that helps. Yes, it's a good question. And look, strategically, the hypothesis was, hey, there's real problems and challenges to help these advisers better operate their businesses that we could solve for in a more effective way and in a cheaper rate for them thus creating real alternatives and real appeal. And then, if you can then integrate them from an automation and a technology statement when I take the service human center investment technology around it, well, that would be a great way to not only create scalability and efficiency in the overall delivery of those services, i.e., do them for a lower cost but then again, improve and enhance the value of it. So, I think that's the journey we're on. That's the journey we're on with the first generation of solutions that we offer to the marketplace. I think Audette [ph], CFO, marketing as the professional services that started with. I think we continue to refine them and improve and enhance them that will give us potential pricing power in certain of those solutions and services or they continues to innovate on how you offer them to the marketplace and it could be that you turn those that holistic sort of CFO solution into different discrete solutions, think about bookkeeping there's a derivative effect that might have a lower price point but solved for unique need within the old CFO scope. And so there's another number of iterations that we can take to create product expansion that have different price points that actually make it more accessible and easier for us to serve a broader set of advisers. So you've got both dynamics. It's product innovation needs, different positioning in the marketplace that will drive price points. And to your point, if you create more value, then you can also charge more historically consistent but valuable existing service. So I think all of those spectrum possibilities are there for us. We are heavily into the innovation and trying to learn and understand what problems or challenges we're hearing from advisers and then how we can turn that into a service. You mentioned some things that are in the incubation phase in or what I might call, pilot based -- bookkeeping is one of those that we think will be an interesting opportunity that we'll go to market later this year on and then we've got another probably five or six that are in that incubation phase that would then logically would move to a pilot. I hope that helps. Yes. So there's a variety of different solutions and services that are offered, right? So you have the professional services that I mentioned before, adding the CFO marketing business strategy, then you have some business solutions that we've created that are more like M&A solutions, our assurance plan, remote office, resilience plan and even now paraplanning as a solution. And so they're slightly different in the values that they create and they're slightly different than how an adviser may use them. And so they're distinctively different than they have when you think about contracts and things of that nature. But if you take the professional services, generally speaking, that's a one year contract to start that typically speaking, we have done that as a way to present it to the marketplace to make sure that it's not a longer-term commitment as people got acclimated service, understood whether the added value to them or not but then gave us enough time, i.e., a year to make sure that they hadn't informed you and had used it enough to really understand whether it created value for them or not. And I think you have high retention rates on those different types of services. We're also though learning into the marketplace, as I said in my remarks. We saw some advisers that moved over from Waddell & Reed on our admin services that used those for a shorter time frame, I think their intent was to say, \"Hey, I just want these to help me transition over to LPL. So their vision was just one term on that contract and then ultimately would find a different long-term solution. So that's a good learning for us and an opportunity to innovate around that and create a different type of solution or shorter-term specific need in time. There might have a higher price associated with it but still create that value that they need for that short period of time. So that was a good example in learning where you might have had higher attrition rates on the surface of the admin services for that period of time but it was more related to how they were using the service, then it's satisfactory. So again, I think as we innovate on these portfolio and we offer them to the marketplace, we're seeing how people use them in different ways, it's a good learning experience and evolution for us in terms of making sure we fine-tune the value and that we -- they're well positioned in the marketplace to meet those specific needs of the advisers that are looking for help. So net out is, I think, high retention rates. And again, our opportunity is to continue to create awareness and to make sure that we expand that portfolio, so that we reach more advisers with a variety of different solutions that they need. And we think that there's a significant amount of value to be added. It also creates great stickiness and around that overall relationship with us and also has a residual knock-on effect of improving and enhancing the overall performance of the practice only high tailwind to same-store sales and higher retention rates that come along with those additional services as part of the relationship and even help us with new store sales as a differentiated more appealing model. Yes, good question. And I think we -- that was like a year ago, we kind of relaunched, if you will, or went to the marketplace in a more offensive posture relative to our RIA offering. And we continue to go to the marketplace, looking for those opportunities for folks to leverage us as a vertically integrated strategic partner that are RIAs only. We continue to add capabilities and pricing that we believe is competitive and compelling and you're seeing that show up in the recruiting that we've had over the past 12 months. That said, I think there's more that we can do and more opportunity and more -- we can be more intentional about how we go to the market and really establish ourselves as a differentiated strategic partner and a value-added partner and not just a custodian to RIAs. And so we have more to play there that you'll hear more about in the coming quarters. Yes. So I think with respect to the RIA business, look, the last two quarters, you've seen our affiliation models collectively, we've recruited in each of those quarters, a little over $2 billion in assets. And certainly, the RIA solution is a significant contributor to that. So again, we're seeing good traction with our offering in the marketplace today. As I shared with you, though, we see the opportunity to be a more significant vertically integrated strategic partner than just a custodian. And so that's one of the things that we're trying to be intentional about both in terms of how we think about our offering, our pricing and even potentially our branding of that offering. And so there's more to play out there that you'll hear more about as we go forward. But we do see the opportunity, given the size of that market to continue to win share there. I do think with the consolidation of two large custodians, that creates disruption or some potential change in the marketplace. And usually, where there's change, if they're well prepared, chance favors to prepare and you can capitalize on that opportunity. And so I think we certainly see that as one of the possibilities and opportunities amongst a number to win share as we go forward. So, I hope that helps give you a little bit more color and context on the opportunity we see and how we're trying to be intentional about capitalizing. Yes, good question. And so look, as we go forward, our pipeline continues to build across a larger spectrum of financial institutional clients. So I think it's that typical momentum where you have some success, you continue to iterate and all of your value proposition and that tends to create more dialogue and more opportunity. So we certainly see that demand picking up. And one of the biggest hurdles is just the whole onboarding change in a transition process. We continue to learn and apply those insights and new innovations, I'd like to say now make our onboarding and transition process, a differentiated capability. And that's one of the things that we saw as a big opportunity to reduce one of the barriers, if you will, of making that transition and the change. And so, we think that the track record of steady wins, the ongoing evolution and a feel of our model, smooth transitions is increasingly making us confident in the durability of this -- of the growth in this channel. So that maybe answers your first question. Your second question around the banks and their interest and their willingness to have this dialogue. Now I think the significant opportunity we have to add value across sort of a spectrum of economics needs risk management, needs operational efficiency, needs potential growth in their programs, notwithstanding the market volatility. There's a lot of reasons to have a dialogue and a discussion. And again, we see those opportunities to explore those possibilities continuing to evolve in a constructive well. So macro hasn't really altered the trajectory of this. I'd just like to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Howard, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We entered 2022 with a continued focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. As we progressed through the first quarter, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty increased. Conditions like these, the value our advisers provide to their clients is reinforced by helping them to navigate in times of uncertainty. They work to provide personalized financial guidance to millions of American when they need it most, highlights the importance of LPL's mission. It also shines the light on the pivotal work of our employees. We take care of these advisers every day. Guided by this Northstar, we worked together to deliver another quarter of solid business and financial results, while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter businesses. In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.16 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity market. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. First quarter net new assets were $18 billion, which translated to 6% annualized growth, driven by solid new store sales, same-store sales and adviser retention. These results contributed to an 11% organic growth rate in the past 12 months. Looking at recruited assets, they were $10.4 billion in Q1, which prior to onboarding large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year. These results were driven by the continued enhancement of the feel of our model and the efficacy of our business development. Looking at same-store sales, they remained solid in the first quarter as our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. With respect to retention, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the first quarter and over the past 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.95 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire adviser-centered marketplace, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. And to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth in Q1, with approximately $7 billion in assets. In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering we recruited nearly $3 billion in assets in Q1. And this quarterly total was a new high for these models and reflects the increased diversification of our recruiting. In each of these three models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions to organic growth going forward. The large financial institutions market was a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&P. For 2022, CUNA is on track to join later this quarter. And we are prepared and ready to onboard their approximately 550 advisers located across almost 300 credit unions, who serve $36 billion of brokerage and advisory assets. Also within this year, we will onboard People's United Bank, which was acquired by M&T and includes approximately 30 advisers serving $6 billion of brokerage and advisory assets. For these institutions, we will use new innovations that will make it easier to transition to LPL and, in turn, help make our offering even more appealing and ultimately contribute to future growth. As we look ahead at the market opportunity for large institutions, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As part of that focus, in 2022 we are continuing to enrich our wealth management platforms including the enhancement of our advisory solutions, in allignment with the secular trend towards advisory, which continues in our business and across the industry. For example, in the first quarter, we expanded the investment options available in our centrally managed platforms by integrating separately managed accounts. Doing so makes it easier and more efficient for advisors to leverage separately managed accounts which can drive higher utilization and further growth of centrally managed platforms. As a result, this enhancement increases our advisory platforms\u2019 value to both existing and prospective advisors. Let\u2019s next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and, in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years we have transformed our service model into an omni-channel, Client Care Model which includes voice, chat, and digital support thus giving advisors flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisors. Now, for the next phase of our transformation we are focused on expanding and enriching specifically our digital support in order to provide greater flexibility, speed, and accuracy for our advisors. As an example, we are developing end-to-end digital experiences in core clearing functions including money movement, account opening, and account transfers which collectively drive the majority of our service center activity. Now by streamlining our core clearing functions, we believe that we can enhance service levels, delight advisors, and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform going forward. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio to help advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace and provide comprehensive advice to their clients. One of the key components of this play is our Business Services portfolio which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. Our subscription base continued to grow ending the quarter at nearly 3,500 which more than doubled year-over-year, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. Now as we work with advisors on existing solutions, we are leveraging our learnings and insights as a catalyst for new solutions as well. Examples of this include our new Bookkeeping solution, which is currently in pilot as well as our enhanced Admin Solutions offering, which provides a next-generation tech-enabled task-management system. We also continue to progress on the opportunity that we introduced last quarter to help advisors provide comprehensive financial advice and planning solutions. Our first offering, Paraplanning, has generated solid initial momentum in the marketplace. Our approach is to give advisors a scalable platform to efficiently and effectively deliver more financial plans and access greater expertise that helps them deepen their client relationships. We launched this offering in January, and by the end of Q1, we had approximately 60 subscribers. Now, at the same time we continue to work to expand the portfolio including tax planning and high net worth solutions. As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio, which in turn positions us to drive additional gross profit and organic growth over time. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result drive long-term shareholder value.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.  As we move into 2022, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. While the market backdrop was volatile, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we are preparing to onboard two large financial institutions this year with CUNA and People\u2019s United Bank. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace, and grow our business. Now let\u2019s turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, down 4% from Q4, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $18 billion or a 6% annualized growth rate. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q1 recruited assets were $10 billion, which prior to large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year and brought our 12-month total to $76 billion. Moving on to our business mix, we continued to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $17 billion, or an 11% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets reached a new high of 54% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.95, up 10% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $669 million, up $26 million or 4% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net payout were $227 million, up $27 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and seasonally lower production bonus expenses. In Q1 our payout rate was 86.1%, down about 150 basis points from Q4, largely driven to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to the low 87% range, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production points. I would also note we expect the payout rate to increase following the onboarding of [indiscernible], but given the timing of when they join, we expect to see that increase mainly in Q3. Moving on to asset based revenue, sponsor revenue was $212 million in Q1, down $8 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter driven by lower equity points. Turning to client cash revenue, it was $85 million up $3 million from Q4. This was primarily driven by the March rate hike, which more than offset expected, fixed rate contract pricing, looking at overall client cash balances. There were $62 billion up $5 billion from last quarter. Within our ICA portfolio as expected in Q1, we renewed a $1 billion fixed rate maturity into a new four year contract. In addition in March, we were able to add floating rate capacity, which drove a roughly 3 billion increase in ICA balances. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 102 basis points in Q1, up 1 basis point from Q4. As a reminder, our ICA balances are primarily indexed to Fed funds. So the ICA yield benefited from the March rate hike for the last two weeks of the quarter. As we think about our Q2 ICA yield and prior to any changes in interest rates, we would expect an increase in yields on our floating rate balances. As we see the whole benefit of the March hike, while yields on our fixed rate portfolio will adjust for the renewal in Q1. The net effect is we expect our Q2 ICA yield to increase by a couple of basis points. Now let's turn to service and fee revenue, which in Q1 was $113 million, up $2 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our services group revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at our services group, which includes business services and planning and advice services, we ended the quarter with more than 3,500 subscriptions, which is up about 500 from last quarter and roughly double a year ago. Our services group now generates roughly 30 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by a couple million sequentially, driven by seasonal declines in IRA and conferencing. Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $7 million sequentially due to increased trading volume from equity market volatility. As we look ahead to Q2, volumes in April have pulled back from elevated Q1 loans, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $5 million Q1. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses starting with core SG&A, it was $281 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. I would also note that with peoples now planning to join in the second half of this year, we anticipate up to $5 million of additional core G&A in 2022 to support this new large financial institution. Moving on to Q1 promotional expense was $87 million, up $1 million sequentially, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend, as we had two of our largest conferences of the year in Q1. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense will increase by a couple million sequentially. As we anticipate increased costs from transition assistance and large financial institution onboarding will largely offset by lower conference expense. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed, the integration is on track to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it is roughly $70 million in Q1. And we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $95 million by the end of Q2. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $45 million in Q1 up $5 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q1 with the leverage ratio at 2.16 times and corporate cash of $270 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with returns we generated. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q1, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases buying back 50 million of our shares. As we look ahead to Q2, we will remain focused on our capital allocation priorities. I would note we expect an increase in capital deployed for organic growth with the onboarding of [indiscernible] in the related transition assistance that will be paid during quarter. We also anticipate continuing share purchases likely at a similar level as we did in Q1. As we look ahead to the second half of week, and if interest rates continue to increase as market expectations would apply. We would have additional capital to deploy. Our framework for deploying capital is unchanged. It would focus on organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital with shareholders. We will, of course remain flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital of all. As a final point, I want to share that we've scheduled our next investor and analyst day for Wednesday, November 16 in New York City. We look forward to providing more details. As we get closer to the event. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for the question. Maybe we'll start with the ICA dynamics, great to see incremental bank pick up demand a bit here, obviously on the variable side of things. As we think through the cycle, you guys have significant amount of cash still sitting in money market funds is really form of sort of the overflow, I guess because bank demand wasn\u2019t there for the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about the ability to transfer them back into ICA, especially when money market fund yields feel like we\u2019ll start to rise and already higher than what clients would be able to get and their kind of ICA cash balances.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Alex, and I think I\u2019ll hit just kind of cash sweep dynamics overall that I think will hit on the exact point you asked there, and I think you highlighted the money market balance is really a function of overflow as opposed to rate seeking behavior. But I think first on your point on demand with third-party banks, I would just emphasize that we\u2019re really starting to see demand pickup, right? You\u2019ve seen the fixed rates where we were able to put together or put in place the last few quarters, I just emphasize this quarter where you\u2019re able to add $3 billion imbalances from new variable contracts. At competitive rates, right, Fed funds flat on the variable side. And those fixed rates were really at the relevant point on the curve when we put those in place. And maybe even just as important to note, like we\u2019re really early in the Fed tightening cycle, right? Only one increase so far haven\u2019t started to shrink the balance sheet yet. I\u2019m sure you saw the consumer spending numbers come out. Those are picking up, lendings picking up. And I think those are all things that over time would likely lead to further pickup in demand. So I think sitting here today, I think we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re more optimistic about demand continuing to pick up than we have been in a while for the reasons that that I just said. I think to your point on the balances themselves in a rising rate environment, sitting in the money market that are really overflows, I think the key is just the nature of the cash balances that we have. I don\u2019t know if you saw it, but we added a page in our key metrics that Page 18, that gives a I think a nice illustration of that, which is the cash in our cash sweep is largely operation, right? It means it\u2019s cash available for rebalancing, for paying fees, customer withdrawals and I think that\u2019s why you see it as one of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM really in our industry in that 5% zone. And the key thing to your question that really tends to move that percent up or down is really market sentiment not rate seeking behavior. And I think you can see that in the chart when there\u2019s elevated volatility folks called in risk off mode, right? You see those balances get up in the 7% zone as an example at the start of the pandemic. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when they\u2019re fully deployed or in risk on mode, if you will, you see that cash get down to call it the 4% zone you saw that if you look in the 2019 time period again market sentiment driven, not really rate driven. The other thing I note is back then back in 2019, more than half of our assets were in brokerage accounts, and those tend to have less cash, right? So if you look at where we are today, the majority of our assets are in advisory accounts that tend to have more cash. So if you adjust for that kind of think of that low point that was at 4%, it\u2019s probably closer to 4.5%. And we\u2019re sitting at 5.3%. So with volatility actually rising. So I think those are the big drivers. And then I know you didn\u2019t ask about it, but on deposit beta, I think like you\u2019ve heard from most folks, we don\u2019t see anything pointing to a change in the price sensitivity of these deposits. So what we saw a lot last cycle, I think it was a good way to think about betas, which low in the early part of the cycle, think 2.5% higher as you get deeper in the cycle, I think 25% with an overall average around 15%. So those are probably the big three dynamics, Alex. And I think as we think about going into this cycle, I think we feel pretty, pretty well set up on the cash sweep cycle.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for saving time on a number of different follow-ups and I\u2019m sure people are going to happy. I guess just to kind of wrap this up though and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but is your expectation to move ultimately all the money market accounts back into ICA, assuming that the bank demand is there.\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think the way I think about it for operational cash, right, the product is a bank product, and you have a pandemic dynamic where the demand wasn\u2019t there. For folks where they have call it rate seeking cash or investing cash, we have separate products for those and people \u2013 and those are available and they can put that money there. That\u2019s just not really the primary nature of this cash it\u2019s really operations.\nAlex Blostein: Awesome. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe let\u2019s start with business solutions. Great to see combination of just strong absolute growth quarter-to-quarter, and then also I did pick up on PAS pick up 63 subscriptions in the quarter. Can you unpack that a little bit more just sort of where you\u2019re seeing the success cross sell of across financial advisors and within PAS, is that being sort of cross sell to those that already have business solutions, subscriptions, or new just trying to get a sense of sort of penetration and growth in front of us?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Bill, it\u2019s Dan. It\u2019s a great question. And I think as we step back and look at the opportunity set, it\u2019s too old to extend the offering across a broader set of our advisors. If you think about 3,500 subscriptions that may cover roughly the 2,000 advisors. And so you\u2019ve got lots of opportunity if you will to expand the offering across our client base, one. And then two, as they have success with one of these services then it\u2019s very logical that that they would explore the extension of that relationship to engage in another service. And so we do believe that that certain different profiles of advisors could have as many as two, three as many as four of these relationships, if they truly are leverage points that drive performance in their businesses. And so I think that\u2019s the right sort of dynamic that you identified in terms of the opportunity set. As we look at it today, most of them are advisors that have one relationship. We\u2019ve seen great success as an example with the original CFO solution, which ended up creating more value than just that financial acumen that sometimes advisors need and want to leverage. It actually provides additional strategic leverage that really helps them think about a broad best \u2013 a broad base set of challenges and considerations and decisions they have to make across the businesses. You got a partner that brings that outside in thinking and compliments their perspective. Then I think they get great value out of enriching the decision making \u2013 they make about their businesses. So that\u2019s one that we find continuing sort of growing, understanding around the value of it, and then happy clients share that with other clients and talk about their pragmatic experiences around it. It gives an example of a solution like that great momentum. And so that\u2019s maybe just a quick down to highlight one of the solutions. I think on the other side, this new category, we just opened up around the planning concept. That\u2019s all about providing holistic advice and how do we help advisors do that in order to help them differentiate and grow. And we went right at a big challenge out in the marketplace, which is, hey, if I got a client book of 300 clients, and I only have been able to do 30 plans for those clients because of the complexity and the time spent, et cetera, not only to set them up, but to support them going forward. If I\u2019ve got a leverage point of resource that can help me do that and I can take that from 30 to 200 relationships within my book. Well, then now I\u2019ve opened up a much, much broader orientation to my client relationship that creates a whole lot more solutions for me to solve for, which creates real value in helping me grow a relationship. It also gives me a long-term orientation to that client relationship where I can make sure we\u2019re executing on that plan. Every year we hit new life events. I stepped in to add more value. So it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s really meant as a big time transformer, if you will into the orientation of client relationships, it create much more opportunity over the long haul. So that\u2019s why we think that one\u2019s so important and you can see then the residual kind of services that we could build around Paraplanning. That\u2019s why we talk about tax planning, state planning, high net worth solutions. You can just really add to that baseline Paraplanning a lot of complimentary services. So let me give you a little bit of a framework at least for the growth potential, as well as I think the two categories of solutions we have and a little bit of a pragmatic example on each side.\nBill Katz: Great. Thanks so much. And then Matt, just my follow-up coming back to maybe rate sensitivity a little bit, can you talk a little bit about where your heads at in terms of migrating from float to fixed just given the shift of rates, I\u2019d appreciate the belly of the curve is sort of flat is at some point. And also you had mentioned that you picked up a contract that Fed funds flat, and I think that compares to sort of Fed funds plus 20, 30 basis points in the past. Would you envision as demand for deposits rises that that spread might re-widen along the way? Thank you.\nMatt Audette: Sure, Bill. I mean I think on the fixed rate appetite, I think our view there is really unchanged, right. I think if there\u2019s demand and it\u2019s up to us on how much to fix out that 50% to 75% zone is the zone that we want to be in. And I think when we\u2019re early in a cycle and there\u2019s some in this \u2013 in the yield curve starting to move up, I think we want to be on the shorter duration side and closer to that 50%. Now the opportunities aren\u2019t there, right? Because the demand is still limited from the bank side. But if we\u2019re able to execute, I think it would be the same strategy that we had articulated before. So we\u2019ll look to see as demand comes back or how quickly that comes back. On the variable right side, I think, yes, I think in this environment where there\u2019s still this amount of liquidity, I think Fed funds around Fed funds flat, I think is what you should expect to see for a while. Once you\u2019re in a place where there is demands \u2013 full demand for the deposits, I think if that is the point where you would start to see spreads widen. So the question is just how quickly does that happen? That\u2019s hard to know, but I think the spreads probably don\u2019t start to widen until your demands fully being there.\nBill Katz: Thank you very much.\nDan Arnold: Good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Hey, how are you?\nDan Arnold: Hey.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. Glad he said my last name. That\u2019s\u2026\nDan Arnold: There you go.\nBrennan Hawken: So just a quick question here on the expectation around 2Q ICA yield improvement only going up a few bps. Is that only based Matt, on what we\u2019ve seen so far from the Fed, because the forward curve is telling us that May and June are not only live they\u2019re likely to both be 50.\nMatt Audette: Yes, no, absolutely. That\u2019s prior to any additional rating. And then I think you can see the sensitivities that we put out on. If those increases do occur, you can see the math that flows out of that, but that was just to give you a kind of a baseline on where we are before anymore.\nBrennan Hawken: Perfect. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then the \u2013 I appreciate you referencing Slide 18, because that was going to be something I was going to explore. Have you looked at what that rate looks like? The percentage of cash, percentage of client assets in cash when you add also some of the purchase money market funds and other products that you all have available on the platform and how that might change over time and under different interest rate environments.\nDan Arnold: Yes, Brennan, I think that if you go back a couple pages on Slide 16, you can see that we\u2019ve got the purchase money market funds on that chart. So you can see that data, but the thing I would emphasize is back to their the rate sensitivity of these balances and it\u2019s just not rate sensitive cash. It is that operational cash that is used for rebalancing for paying fees, the balances themselves, right? If you just look at where we ended Q1 on average, it\u2019s 8,000 per account. So it\u2019s just not the type of cash that\u2019s looking for investment, it really is there to facilitate those things. So I think when you look at Slide 18 we think the primary driver is really where the equity markets are, whether that cash is fully deployed or not. And not primarily driven by rates.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. Okay. That\u2019s all really fair. It\u2019s of course, I understanding all of that. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve seen given the rapidity of hikes, the fact that, that it could move so quickly, certainly you guys are using the money market fund sweep to a greater degree. And so if it shifts over, it could be a bigger change. And there\u2019s been a another competitor that, that went through a transition from money market to bank account, it led to some disruption in the last cycle. So that\u2019s probably why there\u2019s a bit more attention there. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDan Arnold: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt.\nDan Arnold: Good afternoon.\nSteven Chubak: So wanted to ask a follow-up. Sorry to beat the dead horse of Slide 18. But we\u2019ve gotten some questions and there\u2019s some confusion I wanted to clear up, specifically around how to think about cash growth this cycle versus last cycle. So a lot of folks are looking at the slide, seeing that cash balances themselves in the last tightening cycle didn\u2019t grow very much were essentially stable. But of course this time around your organic growth profile is much stronger. And I was hoping you can speak to what would support better organic cash growth this cycle relative to last? And how you\u2019re just thinking about the cash algorithm generally would be really helpful.\nMatt Audette: Sure. I mean, I think there\u2019s a couple things to highlight. I think on the organic growth, right? I talked about a little bit earlier if you heard. But our growth continues to be more and more in advisory, which has higher cash balance, right? So when you think about organic growth continuing to pick up, maybe if you\u2019re looking at this slide on the right hand side of it, that\u2019s where advisory growth has picked up more versus the left hand side. So I think that\u2019s one thing to factor in. And then second, I think when you look at the last cycle, I think and it\u2019s not on the chart, but again, the key driver is equity market movements or overall market sentiment. And maybe if you hone in on in the end of 2018, early 2019, you can see that spike up to 5.6%, right, still at the peak of the rate environment. This is because you had equity market drops. And then of course, moving over the right further when you pick up a Q1 2020 to 7.1% beginning of the pandemic. So I think what this chart shows is the thing that meaningfully moves that cash is really market sentiment and less so interest rate sensitivity. And to the point in your question continuing to grow more and more on the advisory side, overall is going to bias that percentage to be up slightly as well.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great. And my follow-up maybe for Dan. I was hoping you could just speak to how the M&A landscape is evolving and whether you have increased acquisition appetite as the current macro backdrop taking a step back higher rates, lower markets really should in theory bolster your relative financial position versus many of your private IVD peers that are in self clearing. And just wanted to get a sense as to whether this is an opportune time, given the strength of your earnings profile, your improving relative position to maybe get a little bit more aggressive on the M&A front.\nDan Arnold: Yes, Steven. Look, I think our framework hasn\u2019t changed, we first focus on organic growth and looking at opportunities to deploy that capital, even when at a place of strength in order to enhance our ability to differentiate and grow organically. And so in a down market, we see those opportunities around recruiting as an example where other firms may be struggling to invest in capabilities or they have less stable platforms. And they have the opportunity around a flight to quality as an example. And we\u2019ve seen those opportunities occur at the beginning of the pandemic was a good example of that. And so obviously, we stand ready and positioned for those opportunities. I do think and then you look at M&A as a compliment to that organic growth, we\u2019re constantly looking across the landscape. It\u2019s smaller broker dealers and RAAs that may be an opportunity and interesting perspective to support our overall growth agenda. And so those are interesting opportunities that we continue to look at. You do tend to see some of those emerge more readily in a more challenging market. And then I think finally, as we look across the broader landscape of the marketplace, challenging markets bring about probably accelerated consolidation. And we certainly \u2013 if we feel well positioned and then we can follow our sort of formula, if you will, for how we think about the relevance of M&A, it\u2019s got to make strategic sense, it\u2019s got to be financially prudent and we got to make sure that we can operate and execute on it. Then we\u2019ll be rather opportunistic there too. So I think that\u2019s sort of the order of which we would explore deploying capital to drive growth organic in smaller acquisitions, capability acquisitions, and then finally a larger more transformation. I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: Very helpful. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about recruiting? Just curious how this more volatile equity market backdrop with rising rates and less certain macro picture, I guess, more broadly impacting recruiting trends. Maybe you could share a little bit of color around the pipeline and it looks like you\u2019ve been adding about 300 advisors or so per quarter outside of M&A and the mandate wins. So just curious your perspective on sort of the forward look around sustainability of that sort of case adding about 300 or so per quarter.\nDan Arnold: Yes. So I might start with just a quick sort of step talk on where we are, and then we\u2019ll talk about a little bit about as we think about it going forward. So as a reminder, over the past year, we\u2019ve recruited $76 billion in assets. And if you click down on Q1 that included $10 billion in Q1, which say our largest first quarter we\u2019ve ever had X large financial institutions being a part of that. And so that certainly I think reinforces the continued success and opportunity, even in a marketplace it\u2019s under a changing conditions, if you will. And then I think if you look at, we closed the quarter strong with almost 50% of that recruiting happening in March, so you got solid momentum as you kind of move away from some of the original episodic sort of geopolitical event that caused the volatility to start. And then I think as we \u2013 it gives us a good baseline if you will to look forward. And then you\u2019ve got recruiting opportunities in the financial institution space that we talked about earlier, People\u2019s United to add to that, as well as this growing diversity of our recruiting across our new affiliation models. Our strategic wealth Linsco and RIA new models all contributed collectively $3 billion in the first quarter, which is a high for those new models. And so we believe that those sort of dynamics and optionality and flexibility within the model and our ability to continue to invest and enhance the appeal of it sets up for a good solid opportunity, if you will, as we move forward through 2022. The pipelines continue to grow in each one of those affiliation models. So, we\u2019re encouraged by the opportunity as we go forward. And look, even in a down market, if we get some extended down equity market, that typically works as a tailwind to recruiting as once you get sort of past that sort of initial stage of that more challenging market, and advisors have kind of acclimated to that, they\u2019ll begin to pick up and use that time as an opportunity to look around and see how they strengthen their business strategically. So, if we do end up in some extended down market, those can be a tailwind. That\u2019s how we see \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it across the balance of the year. I hope that helps.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You were mentioning some of the new affiliation models. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the new employee model? Just update us on how that\u2019s progressing in terms of bringing on new advisors and assets? And to what extent could an acquisition make sense in that part of your business to be helpful in terms of accelerating your scale and presence in the marketplace there?\nDan Arnold: Yes. It\u2019s a good question. And look, that model is really builds a really interesting and differentiated space in the spectrum of different models that exist in the marketplace. And just the foundation of its value sort of leads to a hypothesis that, that has good, strong opportunity in front of it. We certainly have had to establish ourselves with a credible solution in the marketplace. And winning begets more winning. And I think we see momentum building as we\u2019re doing that now in a variety of different geographical areas across the country and are really encouraged by how we think that model is positioned in the marketplace, its appeal. And now as we build our market share, it gives us even further kind of right to win credibility there. So very encouraging trend. And you\u2019re right, I think this is one of those places that you might use an acquisition strategically if you just wanted to accelerate or add momentum to this particular model. If you remember, it\u2019s kind of how we started it with an acquisition of Allen & Co, which really gave us the initial foundation of learning and insight to try to build this model as appealing as we could make it and as differentiated. So, I think your hypothesis around could be complemented with M&A is certainly a logical place we would explore.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gerry O\u2019Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess staying on theme a little bit, but the financial institutions, it seems as though there\u2019s been a cadence of perhaps one or two per year. Is there any sort of capacity constraint with respect to how many types of deals you can realistically expect to achieve in kind of a 12- to 18-month period, either from a staffing or just operational aspect of it all?\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think when we originally started with these larger financial institution deals, admittedly, we had some things to learn and to in terms of both how you transition them into LPL and then how you support and help them acclimate, I\u2019ll call it, in the first four to six months, which is a change management effort. And I think we had lots of room for improvement as we learned around our first rounds, and we use that data and those insights then to turn and create new solutions, new digital capabilities, new technology solutions to streamline things, better understanding about how to deploy human capital in order to support them. And I think, presumably, not only will that help you get better at doing them in the second round, it also begins to help you drive efficiency and scalability into the overall effort. And so part of that is on-boarding them and how do we think about continuing to automate that to drive scalability into that. So, I would tell you, we\u2019re learning into that, and we\u2019ll get better and better at it, and we\u2019ll automate it more and more. But I think it is reasonable to say there would always be some cap. I think we\u2019ve got to continue to innovate first into that, and we\u2019ve got room for improvement there. I think the second thing is also just learning to operate at higher growth rates. And I don\u2019t mean just in the initial transition. I mean how you support a higher growth rate on an ongoing basis. And I think this is where we see investments in our core operating platform, think service, compliance and operations and how we\u2019re really exploring how do you digitize all of them to the extent that you can, and the scalability of the model really becomes interested not only in being able to facilitate those much higher growth rates on a sustainable basis, but also in the efficiency gains that you pull through it. So, I think when we talk about these digital end-to-end investments in our core clearing function, those are great examples of where we see helping ourselves sustain higher growth rates are the longer period. I hope that helps, but that's a couple of areas where I think we think about how we improve and invest, position ourselves for the long-term for both higher growth rates and being able to bring in more [indiscernible].\nGerry O\u2019Hara: Great. Yes, that is helpful. And that's it for me this afternoon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Give you a question on promotional expenses. If we exclude transition assistance I guess the 2Q guide would really not \u2013 would really imply not much change in that line versus the first and fourth quarter. Just wondering if you can quantify how much of the 2Q guide is attributable to those one-time on-boarding type costs that you cited? And really what I'm getting at is, is whether this kind of $45 million range for that promo expense excluding TA is a good new kind of run rate to think about moving forward. Because when I think, when we look back historically that that promo ex-TA was running around 25 to 30 pre-pandemic. So just getting a little bit more color there would be helpful?\nDan Arnold: Yes, definitely. I mean, when you look at Q2 there's a couple things to highlight from a trend standpoint. And I think the first is really conference spend. So is a reminder, this year we're turning back to a more call it typical conference schedule for us, which means the majority of those expense will show up in Q1 and Q3. So we do expect lower conference expense in Q2, but I think the offset which I think you probed on in your question is really QA joining in the call, right? And the on-boarding expenses associated with a large financial institution in addition to the TA, but those actual on-boarding expenses show up and promotional, and they really peak in the quarter in which that institution joins. And then reminder [indiscernible] is the largest financial institution that world have had. So you do have the typical TA growing not in rate, but I think in overall dollar amounts is our organic growth continues to grow or continues to increase. But I think probably the, the main thing it highlighted is the on-boarding expenses, which are non-recurring for that particular institution, right. If we continue to have more and more institutions we'll have more on-boarding expenses. But they are by their nature sort of non-recurring. And if you, we didn't included this quarter if you go \u2013 if you look at we put together last quarter, just looking at 2021 with M&T and BMO, those were about $15 million of those expenses for the year. And now when you look at this year, we have QA, which is kind of the size of those two institutions together, plus peoples, which is another call it five \u2013 5 billion, 6 billion. So we've got even more coming this year and I think that might be the key to \u2013 from a model standpoint on your side.\nKyle Voigt: It's very helpful. Thank you. And then another question on expenses, you're kind of guiding towards core G&A growth in that high-single digit range this year. I guess in an even more favorable interest rate and revenue backdrop, would there be any reason why that growth rate would vary significantly from the current kind of guidance range of high-single digits? And also maybe if you could just discuss how you balance the tailwinds of an even more favorable macro environment between letting that kind of fall to the bottom line versus the opportunity to invest back more into the business?\nMatt Audette: Yes definitely, and I think when you definitely going to address that, I think that, when you think about rates going up, I think about early in the cycle and I would expect us to let that benefit fall to the bottom line and fully improve our mark. And when I say early in the cycle, think the first 100 basis points or so, right. And once we get beyond that, I think we would consider making additional investments really with a focus on driving growth, but also while still resulting in an overall improvement in margin, right? So I think that's the balance we would have when we get deeper into cycle. And I think the key for us is real, our capital allocation framework to drive the decisions and organic growth is first and foremost on that list. And the things that we would consider are new capabilities for advisors as an example. Further enhancements to the service experience. Investments in expanding the services portfolio that Dan talked about earlier that that all these things is due to dample that can really drive growth. And then of course, beyond investing in the business, we would of course look at other uses for that capital outside the expense side, meaning M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So that's the framework we would use, and I think we're overall, I think we're positioned to really remain flexible and make those decisions at relevant time, meaning when those increases occur.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Wong from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Wong: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to as maybe more of a high level question just on profitability kind of pre-cash so looking at Slide 14 in the gross profit ROA prior to client cash is sort of been coming down just a little bit here over the past couple years. And just wanted to get kind of a higher level thought on what could kind of turn that back the other way. Is it really just kind lapping some of these on-boarding and higher growth related expenses or there other structural things that that you expect that could be a benefit going forward?\nDan Arnold: Yeah. And I think that the key on those trends is maybe just to highlight the changing \u2013 the nature of the revenues that are in there. And I think when you just think about gross profit growth overall, right before we get to ROAs, right? The things that are driving that up are going quite well, right? NNA overall has been increasing year-after-year, recruiting larger advisers. The financial institutions channel is expanding and growing. We've got positive mix shifts, whether it be brokerage to advisory and then within advisory into our centrally managed platforms and then some nice growth, I'm sure you saw, on the service and fee revenue. So those are all things that are driving nice gross profit growth. When you look at it from an ROA standpoint, the challenge is they're not all asset-driven revenues, right? So it can get a little noisier. The adviser-driven fees, the services fees, transaction revenues, as an example, those don't move along with assets. So you get a little bit of noise there. Another one that I think is really important is the large financial institutions. M&T, BMO, CUNA and People's, that gross profit ROA is dilutive to our overall averages because those institutions are much larger. Their gross profit ROAs for us are much lower. But the transition assistance and the expenses to support them are also lower. So they're margin accretive clients for us when you look at it from the lens of purely gross profit ROA, like I think \u2013 like you walked through very well just now. It's going to look like there's a decline when really the economics and the op margins are actually improving. So I think that's the most relevant thing from my standpoint, when you see those trends, we're continuing to drive growth. We're just getting more and more diversified, both in the types of revenues that we have and the size of clients that we have that it looks like there's some compression there when it's really quite a positive story.\nMichael Wong: That's really helpful color. I appreciate that and maybe as a follow-up, just as you've kind of move down the path and done more of these sort of different recruiting models. Are there any lessons learned sort of in terms of the structuring of the deals or the economics of the deals or are you getting better kind of incremental economics now than maybe earlier on with some of the initiatives? It would be helpful to hear anything about that.\nMatt Audette: Yes, I think \u2013 sorry. So I think when you think about the overall economics of the different models and maybe building a little bit on what I was just talking about in the financial institutions, right there's different levels of services provided. So there's different \u2013 not only different levels of revenues, but also different levels of expenses to support it, and then the transition assistance to bring them on board. So I think about the overall returns for us is relatively similar as a baseline, then the more service and support we provide, the more those returns can go up. But I think the key is about the service and capabilities that we provide in those different points.\nMichael Wong: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one final call. That call is from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, thanks for accommodating the follow up. Really appreciate it.\nDan Arnold: Really a repeat customer. This is crazy. Go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Well, now I get to ask the question I really wanted to ask, not on behalf of investors, but myself, which is on the buyback. And Matt heard you loud and clear about the second half and potentially some room for increasing or accelerating the buyback. I know you guys have a very transparent capital return algorithm. But just given the fact that you're running with excess liquidity today, you're already at that lower leverage bound, I was hoping you could speak to what level of buyback we could be contemplating in a higher rate environment relative to the $125 million a quarter you had done previously. And given your stronger earnings power, is it reasonable to expect that it could even be above and beyond that run rate while still support \u2013 while still having ample free cash flow generation to support organic growth in the dividend?\nMatt Audette: Yes. So I think \u2013 so it, of course, all depends on the opportunities we have to allocate capital, Steve, and how much eventually goes to buybacks. But I think maybe a couple of things, right? Just keep in mind, at least for the near term in Q2, with CUNA joining and the transition assistance getting paid in that quarter, that's going to be a meaningful use of cash in the near term to combine with the buybacks that we expect to be at a similar range for Q2. But to your point on the second half of the year, I think to state the obvious, right? If rates go up in line with what the market expects, we're going to have additional capital to deploy. And I think to your point on the leverage range and being at the low end of the range, right, our objective would be to deploy that capital and to manage within that range. And I think where that capital goes is back to our framework, right? Organic growth first and foremost M&A second, and returning capital to shareholders third. So it really just depends on the opportunities that are in front of us at that time. But I think if, in the scenario where the opportunities are primarily in share repurchases and the cash that we generate is going up, I would expect those share repurchases to go up, just all a matter of what the opportunities are, and we'll make our decisions at that time.\nSteven Chubak: That's great to hear. Thanks so much for accommodating the follow up.\nMatt Audette: You bet.\nOperator: I\u2019m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thanks, everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.  As we move into 2022, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. While the market backdrop was volatile, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we are preparing to onboard two large financial institutions this year with CUNA and People's United Bank. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace, and grow our business. Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, down 4% from Q4, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $18 billion or a 6% annualized growth rate. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q1 recruited assets were $10 billion, which prior to large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year and brought our 12-month total to $76 billion. Moving on to our business mix, we continued to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $17 billion, or an 11% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets reached a new high of 54% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory. Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.95, up 10% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $669 million, up $26 million or 4% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net payout were $227 million, up $27 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and seasonally lower production bonus expenses. In Q1 our payout rate was 86.1%, down about 150 basis points from Q4, largely driven to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to the low 87% range, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production points. I would also note we expect the payout rate to increase following the onboarding of [indiscernible], but given the timing of when they join, we expect to see that increase mainly in Q3. Moving on to asset based revenue, sponsor revenue was $212 million in Q1, down $8 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter driven by lower equity points. Turning to client cash revenue, it was $85 million up $3 million from Q4. This was primarily driven by the March rate hike, which more than offset expected, fixed rate contract pricing, looking at overall client cash balances. There were $62 billion up $5 billion from last quarter. Within our ICA portfolio as expected in Q1, we renewed a $1 billion fixed rate maturity into a new four year contract. In addition in March, we were able to add floating rate capacity, which drove a roughly 3 billion increase in ICA balances. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 102 basis points in Q1, up 1 basis point from Q4. As a reminder, our ICA balances are primarily indexed to Fed funds. So the ICA yield benefited from the March rate hike for the last two weeks of the quarter. As we think about our Q2 ICA yield and prior to any changes in interest rates, we would expect an increase in yields on our floating rate balances. As we see the whole benefit of the March hike, while yields on our fixed rate portfolio will adjust for the renewal in Q1. The net effect is we expect our Q2 ICA yield to increase by a couple of basis points. Now let's turn to service and fee revenue, which in Q1 was $113 million, up $2 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our services group revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at our services group, which includes business services and planning and advice services, we ended the quarter with more than 3,500 subscriptions, which is up about 500 from last quarter and roughly double a year ago. Our services group now generates roughly 30 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by a couple million sequentially, driven by seasonal declines in IRA and conferencing. Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $7 million sequentially due to increased trading volume from equity market volatility. As we look ahead to Q2, volumes in April have pulled back from elevated Q1 loans, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $5 million Q1. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core SG&A, it was $281 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. I would also note that with peoples now planning to join in the second half of this year, we anticipate up to $5 million of additional core G&A in 2022 to support this new large financial institution. Moving on to Q1 promotional expense was $87 million, up $1 million sequentially, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend, as we had two of our largest conferences of the year in Q1. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense will increase by a couple million sequentially. As we anticipate increased costs from transition assistance and large financial institution onboarding will largely offset by lower conference expense. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed, the integration is on track to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it is roughly $70 million in Q1. And we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $95 million by the end of Q2. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $45 million in Q1 up $5 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q1 with the leverage ratio at 2.16 times and corporate cash of $270 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with returns we generated. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q1, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases buying back 50 million of our shares. As we look ahead to Q2, we will remain focused on our capital allocation priorities. I would note we expect an increase in capital deployed for organic growth with the onboarding of [indiscernible] in the related transition assistance that will be paid during quarter. We also anticipate continuing share purchases likely at a similar level as we did in Q1. As we look ahead to the second half of week, and if interest rates continue to increase as market expectations would apply. We would have additional capital to deploy. Our framework for deploying capital is unchanged. It would focus on organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital with shareholders. We will, of course remain flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital of all. As a final point, I want to share that we've scheduled our next investor and analyst day for Wednesday, November 16 in New York City. We look forward to providing more details. As we get closer to the event. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that operator, please open the call for questions. Sure, Bill. I mean I think on the fixed rate appetite, I think our view there is really unchanged, right. I think if there's demand and it's up to us on how much to fix out that 50% to 75% zone is the zone that we want to be in. And I think when we're early in a cycle and there's some in this \u2013 in the yield curve starting to move up, I think we want to be on the shorter duration side and closer to that 50%. Now the opportunities aren't there, right? Because the demand is still limited from the bank side. But if we're able to execute, I think it would be the same strategy that we had articulated before. So we'll look to see as demand comes back or how quickly that comes back. On the variable right side, I think, yes, I think in this environment where there's still this amount of liquidity, I think Fed funds around Fed funds flat, I think is what you should expect to see for a while. Once you're in a place where there is demands \u2013 full demand for the deposits, I think if that is the point where you would start to see spreads widen. So the question is just how quickly does that happen? That's hard to know, but I think the spreads probably don't start to widen until your demands fully being there. Yes, no, absolutely. That's prior to any additional rating. And then I think you can see the sensitivities that we put out on. If those increases do occur, you can see the math that flows out of that, but that was just to give you a kind of a baseline on where we are before anymore. Sure. I mean, I think there's a couple things to highlight. I think on the organic growth, right? I talked about a little bit earlier if you heard. But our growth continues to be more and more in advisory, which has higher cash balance, right? So when you think about organic growth continuing to pick up, maybe if you're looking at this slide on the right hand side of it, that's where advisory growth has picked up more versus the left hand side. So I think that's one thing to factor in. And then second, I think when you look at the last cycle, I think and it's not on the chart, but again, the key driver is equity market movements or overall market sentiment. And maybe if you hone in on in the end of 2018, early 2019, you can see that spike up to 5.6%, right, still at the peak of the rate environment. This is because you had equity market drops. And then of course, moving over the right further when you pick up a Q1 2020 to 7.1% beginning of the pandemic. So I think what this chart shows is the thing that meaningfully moves that cash is really market sentiment and less so interest rate sensitivity. And to the point in your question continuing to grow more and more on the advisory side, overall is going to bias that percentage to be up slightly as well. Yes definitely, and I think when you definitely going to address that, I think that, when you think about rates going up, I think about early in the cycle and I would expect us to let that benefit fall to the bottom line and fully improve our mark. And when I say early in the cycle, think the first 100 basis points or so, right. And once we get beyond that, I think we would consider making additional investments really with a focus on driving growth, but also while still resulting in an overall improvement in margin, right? So I think that's the balance we would have when we get deeper into cycle. And I think the key for us is real, our capital allocation framework to drive the decisions and organic growth is first and foremost on that list. And the things that we would consider are new capabilities for advisors as an example. Further enhancements to the service experience. Investments in expanding the services portfolio that Dan talked about earlier that that all these things is due to dample that can really drive growth. And then of course, beyond investing in the business, we would of course look at other uses for that capital outside the expense side, meaning M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So that's the framework we would use, and I think we're overall, I think we're positioned to really remain flexible and make those decisions at relevant time, meaning when those increases occur. Yes, I think \u2013 sorry. So I think when you think about the overall economics of the different models and maybe building a little bit on what I was just talking about in the financial institutions, right there's different levels of services provided. So there's different \u2013 not only different levels of revenues, but also different levels of expenses to support it, and then the transition assistance to bring them on board. So I think about the overall returns for us is relatively similar as a baseline, then the more service and support we provide, the more those returns can go up. But I think the key is about the service and capabilities that we provide in those different points. Yes. So I think \u2013 so it, of course, all depends on the opportunities we have to allocate capital, Steve, and how much eventually goes to buybacks. But I think maybe a couple of things, right? Just keep in mind, at least for the near term in Q2, with CUNA joining and the transition assistance getting paid in that quarter, that's going to be a meaningful use of cash in the near term to combine with the buybacks that we expect to be at a similar range for Q2. But to your point on the second half of the year, I think to state the obvious, right? If rates go up in line with what the market expects, we're going to have additional capital to deploy. And I think to your point on the leverage range and being at the low end of the range, right, our objective would be to deploy that capital and to manage within that range. And I think where that capital goes is back to our framework, right? Organic growth first and foremost M&A second, and returning capital to shareholders third. So it really just depends on the opportunities that are in front of us at that time. But I think if, in the scenario where the opportunities are primarily in share repurchases and the cash that we generate is going up, I would expect those share repurchases to go up, just all a matter of what the opportunities are, and we'll make our decisions at that time. You bet."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We entered 2022 with a continued focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. As we progressed through the first quarter, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty increased. Conditions like these, the value our advisers provide to their clients is reinforced by helping them to navigate in times of uncertainty. They work to provide personalized financial guidance to millions of American when they need it most, highlights the importance of LPL's mission. It also shines the light on the pivotal work of our employees. We take care of these advisers every day. Guided by this Northstar, we worked together to deliver another quarter of solid business and financial results, while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter businesses. In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.16 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity market. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. First quarter net new assets were $18 billion, which translated to 6% annualized growth, driven by solid new store sales, same-store sales and adviser retention. These results contributed to an 11% organic growth rate in the past 12 months. Looking at recruited assets, they were $10.4 billion in Q1, which prior to onboarding large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year. These results were driven by the continued enhancement of the feel of our model and the efficacy of our business development. Looking at same-store sales, they remained solid in the first quarter as our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. With respect to retention, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the first quarter and over the past 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.95 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire adviser-centered marketplace, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. And to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth in Q1, with approximately $7 billion in assets. In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering we recruited nearly $3 billion in assets in Q1. And this quarterly total was a new high for these models and reflects the increased diversification of our recruiting. In each of these three models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions to organic growth going forward. The large financial institutions market was a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&P. For 2022, CUNA is on track to join later this quarter. And we are prepared and ready to onboard their approximately 550 advisers located across almost 300 credit unions, who serve $36 billion of brokerage and advisory assets. Also within this year, we will onboard People's United Bank, which was acquired by M&T and includes approximately 30 advisers serving $6 billion of brokerage and advisory assets. For these institutions, we will use new innovations that will make it easier to transition to LPL and, in turn, help make our offering even more appealing and ultimately contribute to future growth. As we look ahead at the market opportunity for large institutions, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As part of that focus, in 2022 we are continuing to enrich our wealth management platforms including the enhancement of our advisory solutions, in allignment with the secular trend towards advisory, which continues in our business and across the industry. For example, in the first quarter, we expanded the investment options available in our centrally managed platforms by integrating separately managed accounts. Doing so makes it easier and more efficient for advisors to leverage separately managed accounts which can drive higher utilization and further growth of centrally managed platforms. As a result, this enhancement increases our advisory platforms' value to both existing and prospective advisors. Let's next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and, in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years we have transformed our service model into an omni-channel, Client Care Model which includes voice, chat, and digital support thus giving advisors flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisors. Now, for the next phase of our transformation we are focused on expanding and enriching specifically our digital support in order to provide greater flexibility, speed, and accuracy for our advisors. As an example, we are developing end-to-end digital experiences in core clearing functions including money movement, account opening, and account transfers which collectively drive the majority of our service center activity. Now by streamlining our core clearing functions, we believe that we can enhance service levels, delight advisors, and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform going forward. Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio to help advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace and provide comprehensive advice to their clients. One of the key components of this play is our Business Services portfolio which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. Our subscription base continued to grow ending the quarter at nearly 3,500 which more than doubled year-over-year, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal. Now as we work with advisors on existing solutions, we are leveraging our learnings and insights as a catalyst for new solutions as well. Examples of this include our new Bookkeeping solution, which is currently in pilot as well as our enhanced Admin Solutions offering, which provides a next-generation tech-enabled task-management system. We also continue to progress on the opportunity that we introduced last quarter to help advisors provide comprehensive financial advice and planning solutions. Our first offering, Paraplanning, has generated solid initial momentum in the marketplace. Our approach is to give advisors a scalable platform to efficiently and effectively deliver more financial plans and access greater expertise that helps them deepen their client relationships. We launched this offering in January, and by the end of Q1, we had approximately 60 subscribers. Now, at the same time we continue to work to expand the portfolio including tax planning and high net worth solutions. As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio, which in turn positions us to drive additional gross profit and organic growth over time. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result drive long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. Alex, and I think I'll hit just kind of cash sweep dynamics overall that I think will hit on the exact point you asked there, and I think you highlighted the money market balance is really a function of overflow as opposed to rate seeking behavior. But I think first on your point on demand with third-party banks, I would just emphasize that we're really starting to see demand pickup, right? You've seen the fixed rates where we were able to put together or put in place the last few quarters, I just emphasize this quarter where you're able to add $3 billion imbalances from new variable contracts. At competitive rates, right, Fed funds flat on the variable side. And those fixed rates were really at the relevant point on the curve when we put those in place. And maybe even just as important to note, like we're really early in the Fed tightening cycle, right? Only one increase so far haven't started to shrink the balance sheet yet. I'm sure you saw the consumer spending numbers come out. Those are picking up, lendings picking up. And I think those are all things that over time would likely lead to further pickup in demand. So I think sitting here today, I think we've \u2013 we're more optimistic about demand continuing to pick up than we have been in a while for the reasons that that I just said. I think to your point on the balances themselves in a rising rate environment, sitting in the money market that are really overflows, I think the key is just the nature of the cash balances that we have. I don't know if you saw it, but we added a page in our key metrics that Page 18, that gives a I think a nice illustration of that, which is the cash in our cash sweep is largely operation, right? It means it's cash available for rebalancing, for paying fees, customer withdrawals and I think that's why you see it as one of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM really in our industry in that 5% zone. And the key thing to your question that really tends to move that percent up or down is really market sentiment not rate seeking behavior. And I think you can see that in the chart when there's elevated volatility folks called in risk off mode, right? You see those balances get up in the 7% zone as an example at the start of the pandemic. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when they're fully deployed or in risk on mode, if you will, you see that cash get down to call it the 4% zone you saw that if you look in the 2019 time period again market sentiment driven, not really rate driven. The other thing I note is back then back in 2019, more than half of our assets were in brokerage accounts, and those tend to have less cash, right? So if you look at where we are today, the majority of our assets are in advisory accounts that tend to have more cash. So if you adjust for that kind of think of that low point that was at 4%, it's probably closer to 4.5%. And we're sitting at 5.3%. So with volatility actually rising. So I think those are the big drivers. And then I know you didn't ask about it, but on deposit beta, I think like you've heard from most folks, we don't see anything pointing to a change in the price sensitivity of these deposits. So what we saw a lot last cycle, I think it was a good way to think about betas, which low in the early part of the cycle, think 2.5% higher as you get deeper in the cycle, I think 25% with an overall average around 15%. So those are probably the big three dynamics, Alex. And I think as we think about going into this cycle, I think we feel pretty, pretty well set up on the cash sweep cycle. Yes. I think the way I think about it for operational cash, right, the product is a bank product, and you have a pandemic dynamic where the demand wasn't there. For folks where they have call it rate seeking cash or investing cash, we have separate products for those and people \u2013 and those are available and they can put that money there. That's just not really the primary nature of this cash it's really operations. Yes. Bill, it's Dan. It's a great question. And I think as we step back and look at the opportunity set, it's too old to extend the offering across a broader set of our advisors. If you think about 3,500 subscriptions that may cover roughly the 2,000 advisors. And so you've got lots of opportunity if you will to expand the offering across our client base, one. And then two, as they have success with one of these services then it's very logical that that they would explore the extension of that relationship to engage in another service. And so we do believe that that certain different profiles of advisors could have as many as two, three as many as four of these relationships, if they truly are leverage points that drive performance in their businesses. And so I think that's the right sort of dynamic that you identified in terms of the opportunity set. As we look at it today, most of them are advisors that have one relationship. We've seen great success as an example with the original CFO solution, which ended up creating more value than just that financial acumen that sometimes advisors need and want to leverage. It actually provides additional strategic leverage that really helps them think about a broad best \u2013 a broad base set of challenges and considerations and decisions they have to make across the businesses. You got a partner that brings that outside in thinking and compliments their perspective. Then I think they get great value out of enriching the decision making \u2013 they make about their businesses. So that's one that we find continuing sort of growing, understanding around the value of it, and then happy clients share that with other clients and talk about their pragmatic experiences around it. It gives an example of a solution like that great momentum. And so that's maybe just a quick down to highlight one of the solutions. I think on the other side, this new category, we just opened up around the planning concept. That's all about providing holistic advice and how do we help advisors do that in order to help them differentiate and grow. And we went right at a big challenge out in the marketplace, which is, hey, if I got a client book of 300 clients, and I only have been able to do 30 plans for those clients because of the complexity and the time spent, et cetera, not only to set them up, but to support them going forward. If I've got a leverage point of resource that can help me do that and I can take that from 30 to 200 relationships within my book. Well, then now I've opened up a much, much broader orientation to my client relationship that creates a whole lot more solutions for me to solve for, which creates real value in helping me grow a relationship. It also gives me a long-term orientation to that client relationship where I can make sure we're executing on that plan. Every year we hit new life events. I stepped in to add more value. So it's a \u2013 it's really meant as a big time transformer, if you will into the orientation of client relationships, it create much more opportunity over the long haul. So that's why we think that one's so important and you can see then the residual kind of services that we could build around Paraplanning. That's why we talk about tax planning, state planning, high net worth solutions. You can just really add to that baseline Paraplanning a lot of complimentary services. So let me give you a little bit of a framework at least for the growth potential, as well as I think the two categories of solutions we have and a little bit of a pragmatic example on each side. Good. Hey. There you go. Yes, Brennan, I think that if you go back a couple pages on Slide 16, you can see that we've got the purchase money market funds on that chart. So you can see that data, but the thing I would emphasize is back to their the rate sensitivity of these balances and it's just not rate sensitive cash. It is that operational cash that is used for rebalancing for paying fees, the balances themselves, right? If you just look at where we ended Q1 on average, it's 8,000 per account. So it's just not the type of cash that's looking for investment, it really is there to facilitate those things. So I think when you look at Slide 18 we think the primary driver is really where the equity markets are, whether that cash is fully deployed or not. And not primarily driven by rates. Sure. Good afternoon. Yes, Steven. Look, I think our framework hasn't changed, we first focus on organic growth and looking at opportunities to deploy that capital, even when at a place of strength in order to enhance our ability to differentiate and grow organically. And so in a down market, we see those opportunities around recruiting as an example where other firms may be struggling to invest in capabilities or they have less stable platforms. And they have the opportunity around a flight to quality as an example. And we've seen those opportunities occur at the beginning of the pandemic was a good example of that. And so obviously, we stand ready and positioned for those opportunities. I do think and then you look at M&A as a compliment to that organic growth, we're constantly looking across the landscape. It's smaller broker dealers and RAAs that may be an opportunity and interesting perspective to support our overall growth agenda. And so those are interesting opportunities that we continue to look at. You do tend to see some of those emerge more readily in a more challenging market. And then I think finally, as we look across the broader landscape of the marketplace, challenging markets bring about probably accelerated consolidation. And we certainly \u2013 if we feel well positioned and then we can follow our sort of formula, if you will, for how we think about the relevance of M&A, it's got to make strategic sense, it's got to be financially prudent and we got to make sure that we can operate and execute on it. Then we'll be rather opportunistic there too. So I think that's sort of the order of which we would explore deploying capital to drive growth organic in smaller acquisitions, capability acquisitions, and then finally a larger more transformation. I hope that helps. Yes. So I might start with just a quick sort of step talk on where we are, and then we'll talk about a little bit about as we think about it going forward. So as a reminder, over the past year, we've recruited $76 billion in assets. And if you click down on Q1 that included $10 billion in Q1, which say our largest first quarter we've ever had X large financial institutions being a part of that. And so that certainly I think reinforces the continued success and opportunity, even in a marketplace it's under a changing conditions, if you will. And then I think if you look at, we closed the quarter strong with almost 50% of that recruiting happening in March, so you got solid momentum as you kind of move away from some of the original episodic sort of geopolitical event that caused the volatility to start. And then I think as we \u2013 it gives us a good baseline if you will to look forward. And then you've got recruiting opportunities in the financial institution space that we talked about earlier, People's United to add to that, as well as this growing diversity of our recruiting across our new affiliation models. Our strategic wealth Linsco and RIA new models all contributed collectively $3 billion in the first quarter, which is a high for those new models. And so we believe that those sort of dynamics and optionality and flexibility within the model and our ability to continue to invest and enhance the appeal of it sets up for a good solid opportunity, if you will, as we move forward through 2022. The pipelines continue to grow in each one of those affiliation models. So, we're encouraged by the opportunity as we go forward. And look, even in a down market, if we get some extended down equity market, that typically works as a tailwind to recruiting as once you get sort of past that sort of initial stage of that more challenging market, and advisors have kind of acclimated to that, they'll begin to pick up and use that time as an opportunity to look around and see how they strengthen their business strategically. So, if we do end up in some extended down market, those can be a tailwind. That's how we see \u2013 that's how we're looking at it across the balance of the year. I hope that helps. Yes. It's a good question. And look, that model is really builds a really interesting and differentiated space in the spectrum of different models that exist in the marketplace. And just the foundation of its value sort of leads to a hypothesis that, that has good, strong opportunity in front of it. We certainly have had to establish ourselves with a credible solution in the marketplace. And winning begets more winning. And I think we see momentum building as we're doing that now in a variety of different geographical areas across the country and are really encouraged by how we think that model is positioned in the marketplace, its appeal. And now as we build our market share, it gives us even further kind of right to win credibility there. So very encouraging trend. And you're right, I think this is one of those places that you might use an acquisition strategically if you just wanted to accelerate or add momentum to this particular model. If you remember, it's kind of how we started it with an acquisition of Allen & Co, which really gave us the initial foundation of learning and insight to try to build this model as appealing as we could make it and as differentiated. So, I think your hypothesis around could be complemented with M&A is certainly a logical place we would explore. Yes. I think when we originally started with these larger financial institution deals, admittedly, we had some things to learn and to in terms of both how you transition them into LPL and then how you support and help them acclimate, I'll call it, in the first four to six months, which is a change management effort. And I think we had lots of room for improvement as we learned around our first rounds, and we use that data and those insights then to turn and create new solutions, new digital capabilities, new technology solutions to streamline things, better understanding about how to deploy human capital in order to support them. And I think, presumably, not only will that help you get better at doing them in the second round, it also begins to help you drive efficiency and scalability into the overall effort. And so part of that is on-boarding them and how do we think about continuing to automate that to drive scalability into that. So, I would tell you, we're learning into that, and we'll get better and better at it, and we'll automate it more and more. But I think it is reasonable to say there would always be some cap. I think we've got to continue to innovate first into that, and we've got room for improvement there. I think the second thing is also just learning to operate at higher growth rates. And I don't mean just in the initial transition. I mean how you support a higher growth rate on an ongoing basis. And I think this is where we see investments in our core operating platform, think service, compliance and operations and how we're really exploring how do you digitize all of them to the extent that you can, and the scalability of the model really becomes interested not only in being able to facilitate those much higher growth rates on a sustainable basis, but also in the efficiency gains that you pull through it. So, I think when we talk about these digital end-to-end investments in our core clearing function, those are great examples of where we see helping ourselves sustain higher growth rates are the longer period. I hope that helps, but that's a couple of areas where I think we think about how we improve and invest, position ourselves for the long-term for both higher growth rates and being able to bring in more [indiscernible]. Yes, definitely. I mean, when you look at Q2 there's a couple things to highlight from a trend standpoint. And I think the first is really conference spend. So is a reminder, this year we're turning back to a more call it typical conference schedule for us, which means the majority of those expense will show up in Q1 and Q3. So we do expect lower conference expense in Q2, but I think the offset which I think you probed on in your question is really QA joining in the call, right? And the on-boarding expenses associated with a large financial institution in addition to the TA, but those actual on-boarding expenses show up and promotional, and they really peak in the quarter in which that institution joins. And then reminder [indiscernible] is the largest financial institution that world have had. So you do have the typical TA growing not in rate, but I think in overall dollar amounts is our organic growth continues to grow or continues to increase. But I think probably the, the main thing it highlighted is the on-boarding expenses, which are non-recurring for that particular institution, right. If we continue to have more and more institutions we'll have more on-boarding expenses. But they are by their nature sort of non-recurring. And if you, we didn't included this quarter if you go \u2013 if you look at we put together last quarter, just looking at 2021 with M&T and BMO, those were about $15 million of those expenses for the year. And now when you look at this year, we have QA, which is kind of the size of those two institutions together, plus peoples, which is another call it five \u2013 5 billion, 6 billion. So we've got even more coming this year and I think that might be the key to \u2013 from a model standpoint on your side. Yeah. And I think that the key on those trends is maybe just to highlight the changing \u2013 the nature of the revenues that are in there. And I think when you just think about gross profit growth overall, right before we get to ROAs, right? The things that are driving that up are going quite well, right? NNA overall has been increasing year-after-year, recruiting larger advisers. The financial institutions channel is expanding and growing. We've got positive mix shifts, whether it be brokerage to advisory and then within advisory into our centrally managed platforms and then some nice growth, I'm sure you saw, on the service and fee revenue. So those are all things that are driving nice gross profit growth. When you look at it from an ROA standpoint, the challenge is they're not all asset-driven revenues, right? So it can get a little noisier. The adviser-driven fees, the services fees, transaction revenues, as an example, those don't move along with assets. So you get a little bit of noise there. Another one that I think is really important is the large financial institutions. M&T, BMO, CUNA and People's, that gross profit ROA is dilutive to our overall averages because those institutions are much larger. Their gross profit ROAs for us are much lower. But the transition assistance and the expenses to support them are also lower. So they're margin accretive clients for us when you look at it from the lens of purely gross profit ROA, like I think \u2013 like you walked through very well just now. It's going to look like there's a decline when really the economics and the op margins are actually improving. So I think that's the most relevant thing from my standpoint, when you see those trends, we're continuing to drive growth. We're just getting more and more diversified, both in the types of revenues that we have and the size of clients that we have that it looks like there's some compression there when it's really quite a positive story. Really a repeat customer. This is crazy. Go ahead. Thanks, everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Take care."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Amy, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2023, our advisors continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. As we enter the new year, we thank our advisors for their continued commitment and dedication while we remain focused on our mission of taking care of them so they can take care of their clients. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, fourth quarter organic net new assets were $25 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets for the year of $100 billion, representing approximately 9%. In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion, bringing our total for the full year to $80 billion. Prior to large enterprises, recruited assets for the full year were $67 billion, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year and a new annual record. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients. The combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q4. At the same time, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the full year was approximately 99%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.51, which brought our full year total to $15.72, an increase of 36% year-over-year. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the advisor-centered market. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisors\u2019 success throughout the life cycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate with us such that we compete all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace; and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services that help our advisors differentiate win in the marketplace, be great operators of the business. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the fourth quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent fund, adding approximately $14 billion in assets. As a result of the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered our strongest year-to-date, recruiting roughly $15 billion in assets, nearly double the total of the prior year. As we look ahead, we expect the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and our ongoing enhancements to their capabilities will help drive sustained increase in their growth. Next, the traditional bank and credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of accreted assets in Q4. In addition, large enterprises remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2023 with the addition of Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. For 2024, we continue to prepare to onboard the retail wealth management business of potential financial. Now as a part of that process, our team has been on the road meeting with potential advisors to provide them a preliminary orientation to our platform, and the early feedback has been positive. Looking ahead, we are confident that the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises, match with our track record of successful execution, positions us well to help solve the needs of a broad spectrum of institutions. Now within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on investing back into the model in order to deliver a comprehensive platform capability, services and technology that help our advisors differentiated win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As part of this effort, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress on our aspiration of delivering an industry-leading services. This work includes continuing to make our service model more flexible and efficient through a multichannel approach. The purposes of which is to offer a broad spectrum of service options including human-centric support, digital capabilities and artificial intelligence such that we can provide advisors the information they need and the channel that works best for them. In that spirit, over the last year, we have continued to expand our digital capabilities, including our digital hubs, which provides advisors always on support in centralized and intuitive format. Our investments in this area enabled us to expand from 2 digital hubs to 11 over the last year, with the newest being our Tax Hub, which helps advisors process tax business in a streamlined and highly efficient way. While we are still in the early innings of the adoption of this capability set, the percentage of advisors\u2019 interactions that go through digital channels has roughly doubled over the last year from 10% to 20%. And as we continue to refine these capabilities, we believe that digital solutions can ultimately serve as much as 50% of our service interactions. Now as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our service portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of our capability. And as a result of solid demand, the number of advisors utilizing our portfolio of over 14 available services, continues to increase, and we ended the year with nearly 3,900 active users, up 27% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we remain focused on addressing the needs of a broader set of advisors and are innovating on new services that will directionally double the size of our services portfolio over the next two years. And one of the latest innovations in our services portfolio was inspired by our broader efforts to tackle the advisor transition process, which has historically been an industry-wide pain point given the friction and complexity of changing firm. That said, rather than seeing the transition process as a headwind, we view it as an important strategic opportunity. As the easier we can make it for advisors to change firms, the more it will drive up advisor movement in the industry, where we are well-positioned to benefit the market leader in recruiting. To help solve for that opportunity, we have developed several new transition capabilities and solutions, including live testing environment for advisors to familiarize themselves with our platform board transition, fully automated stages of the onboarding process and the suite of transition services that includes short-term admin, branding and bookkeeping support, which helps simplify the transition and onboarding journey and ultimately accelerate advisor\u2019s readiness and growth. Early feedback on these transition services has been positive, and they are proving to be a catalyst for additional subscriptions as 40% of advisors who use these solutions end up subscribing for one or more of our other ongoing services. And as we move forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to solve for advisors' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect business for themselves and ultimately maximize their systems. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their [indiscernible] while driving growth and increasing our marketplace. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiated win in the marketplace and as a result, have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2023. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisors and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities. We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients and continue to make progress with our liquidity and succession solution. So as we enter 2024, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to serve and support our more than 22,000 advisors, while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 9% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity wins. Total organic net new assets were $25 billion or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our total for the year to $80 billion. Looking ahead to Q1, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.51. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, down $3 million sequentially. Our payout rate was 87.6%, up 30 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production moves. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 86.5% as the production bonus resets at the beginning of each year. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $374 million, down $4 million from Q3 as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Client cash balances ended the quarter at $48 billion, up $1 billion sequentially, marking the first quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2022. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances ended the quarter at roughly 60%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q4, there were roughly $2.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed $2 billion of these maturing balances into new 5-year contracts, yielding approximately 415 basis points, which is roughly 85 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 317 basis points in Q4, down 1 basis point from Q3. As for Q1, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points. As for service and fee revenue, it was $131 million in Q4, down $5 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference room fee following our largest advisor conference of the year in Q3 as well as seasonally lower IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by approximately $5 million sequentially on lower conference room. Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $54 million, up $4 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q1, based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple of million sequentially. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.369 billion. This was within our outlook range and for the full year, represents approximately 15% growth. As a reminder, this included an opportunistic 5% of incremental spend focused on accelerating our capabilities as we took advantage of the favorable macro environment. Now, as we look ahead to 2024, we plan to return to more normalized levels of spend, concentrating on investments that enable organic growth and drive operating leverage in our business. In addition, our ongoing investments to scale our business are driving greater efficiencies. Pulling this together, we expect our 2024 core G&A growth rate to be roughly half the rate we saw in 2023. More specifically, we intend to grow 2024 core G&A in a range of 6.25% to 8.75%. As for Q1, we expect core G&A to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Note that this core G&A spend is prior to expenses associated with Prudential. As we move closer to onboarding them towards the end of this year, we'll provide an update on 2024 core G&A. I would just emphasize that we expect only a small amount of spend in 2024 as the majority of these costs will be incurred in 2025. Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $138 million, down $2 million sequentially. As lower conference spend was partially offset by higher prudential related onboarding and integration costs. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect promotional expense to be roughly flat as we have one of our largest advisor conferences during the quarter, which will be offset by seasonal declines in marketing spend. As for regulatory expense, it was $9 million in Q4. Looking forward, given the increased size and scale of our business, we would expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $16 million in Q4, flat compared to Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $6 million sequentially, as Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock boards. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $184 million. I would note that during the quarter, we completed our first investment-grade debt offer, issuing $750 million of senior notes. With that, our leverage ratio increased to 1.6x and is within our target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x. Turning to how we deploy that capital. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q4, we deployed capital across our entire frame as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders repurchasing $225 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q1, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute our $2 billion authorization over two years. Turning now to interest expense. It was $54 million in Q4, up $6 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $7 million from Q4. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Maybe just to start off with a question on core G&A and organic growth. The double-digit organic growth you've achieved these past three years, it's really been bolstered at least in part by significant investments in the platform, and core G&A has also grown at a double-digit clip as well. So the updated core G&A guide for '24 certainly surprised positively. It does imply a significant moderation as you noted, Matt, in expense growth. But should we expect a slower G&A growth to drive a commensurate slowdown in organic? Or do you feel the NNA momentum can be sustained even with the moderation in G&A spend?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Steven, I'll give you some color here, but the answer is going to be the latter. I think the investments are moderated and our confidence and conviction around continuing to drive organic growth is just the same. Now the details below that, just building a little bit on what I shared in the prepared remarks, the cost strategy or investment strategy remains driving investments prioritizing to drive organic growth, as well as driving productivity and efficiency. And I think what's probably most relevant in this conversation is also adapting as the environment evolves. So if you look at, to your point, on 2023 and growing 15%. You kind of break that into -- that 15% into three equal categories of about 5% each. The first was really about serving and supporting the core business growth. The second was about continuing to make investments to really improve our value prop, through and establish ourselves in the new models and addressable market to scale our services, things of that nature. And that third category, that third 5% was really just being opportunistic about the market really accelerating investments. And I think when you look at the guidance for 2024, our plans for 2024, it's really pulling back in that third category. So we're continuing to make the investments that support growth. We're continuing to make the investments to improve our value proposition and capabilities in just those two things, and this may get really to the core of your question, that would typically lead to core G&A growth in the 8% to 10% range. But then you put on top of that, the investments we're making for productivity and efficiency which do create capacity to invest each and every year are getting even better. And it's that final point that brings us down to the 6.25% to 8.75%. So hopefully, the color helped there, but I think the headline point is our conviction on continuing to deliver organic growth in this high single-digits remains.\nSteven Chubak: That's great to hear. And for my follow-up, Matt, I was hoping you could just provide an update on January trends. I know it's a seasonally weaker month, typically for both NNA and cash. And just with cash trends also stabilizing over the last six months, just speak to your confidence level that some of these sorting headwinds, which have gotten a lot of their play are largely in the rearview.\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think I'll start on cash. I mean the headline is we really saw a cash start to stabilize back in July. So really, if you look at the second half of the year, even by the months, we ended the year at a pretty similar level of where we ended July. So I think what we're seeing in January is really a continuation of that stability. So just a reminder, the seasonal factor that does hit in January is advisory fees typically hit primarily in the first month of the quarter. So we -- so those do reduce cash balances. It's around $1.2 billion. Outside of that though, we've continued to see stability. So the amount of cash balance moving from customer activity was actually a slight increase in January. So you put that together and cash balances overall for the month are down $1.2 billion, but it's primarily driven by those fees and the activity is actually a slight increase. So I think headline is continuing to see stability on the cash sweep side. On the organic growth side, and maybe just -- I'll give a little bit of context and perspective on the overall quarter as well as the month of January. To your point on your first question, when you look at the last 3, 4 years of really driving and delivering that high single-digit organic growth, given the nature of Q1, the first quarter is usually a little bit lower. So in those years, it was typically in the 6% to 7% zone. So if we look at what we're seeing for Q1 '24, is really delivering something in a similar place, that's 6% to 7%. The only thing I would highlight and the reason for this color is we would expect January to actually be a little bit lower than normal in the 1% to 2% zone, and then February and March actually to be higher than typical, really at those high single-digits, really coming together at a 6% to 7% for the quarter. And really, the reason for that is that the seasonal factors that we just talked about on the cash sweep side, meaning advisory fees hitting in the first month of the quarter as well as you have on the NNA front, that normal slowdown in the first half of January because of the FINRA closing in the second half of December as well as advisors taking time off. You have those normal factors that come through in January. Two things I would highlight, though, for this January. First is recruiting. Our recruiting continues to be strong. You may recall, Q1 of last year, we set a new record in recruiting prior to large enterprises at around $13 billion. We're on track to exceed that in the first quarter this year. So continued strength there, just the timing is a little shifted more towards February and March. So you got a little bit of weakness in January. And then on the attrition side, a little bit of the opposite and that attrition is going to be a little bit heavier in January versus February and March, as we had two practices that were acquired to part during the month. And that's normal. It happens from time to time. We just happen to have two in a single month in January. Outside of that, our retention remains consistently high with the levels we've seen. So lots of color there, but I would headline it in, we're looking at Q1 and continuing in that 6% to 7% zone. And you're just going to have a little bit of a different shape to the quarter with January in that 1% to 2% zone.\nSteven Chubak: Lots to unpack there, but thanks so much for the detail, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question, as well. Dan, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the large enterprise channel for you guys. It's been an area of significant success over the last couple of years. So maybe talk a little bit about deal activity expectations for 2024. And in particular, curious about the level of engagement you guys are seeing from insurance company clients on the back of the Pru deal.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, with respect to our large enterprise channel, we opened this market up back in 2020 with a novel outsourcing solution. And initially, we targeted larger banks. And we have seen some success up to this point, capturing about $85 billion of assets to our platform. If you look at the total market for banks and outsourcing of wealth management for wealth management, it's roughly in and around $1 trillion. We believe our experience, reputation and capability set, it's a compelling solution that helps continue to strengthen that pipeline and offer up an interesting durable growth opportunity as we move forward. That said, at the same time, we took our solution that was targeted to banks and we made some additional investments and capabilities and personalized options, which enabled us to extend the appeal of that model to, as you said, the insurance companies or product manufacturers that operate wealth management solutions. And now that market represents an additional $1.5 trillion of opportunity. And with the Prudential announcement, it was a catalyst for additional inquiries, exploring the question. So why aren't they outsourcing? And we continue to progress in these discussions and explore others. They're still in the early stages, but we do believe this part of the pipeline will continue to evolve as well. So if I summarize it, as we move forward, we believe our market leadership capability set and a real deep IT for this enterprise channel creates a really unique growth opportunity for us. We're excited about it.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. And a quick follow-up for you, Matt. So nice to see you guys moving forward with reinvestments of the six ICA maturities of the $2 billion that you mentioned. How is demand holding up in the ICA channel for additional fixed maturities as we kind of think about the $6.5 billion tranche that's coming out this year? And is there a way to sort of accelerate some of that reinvestment? I know you provided a schedule kind of how that shakes out over the course of the year. But any opportunity to move a little faster in case rates just to start moving lower to lock-in wider spreads?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Alex, I think on the demand, the demand is strong. Like if you look at the $2 billion that we did place into new contracts towards the end of the quarter, we're able to place them in 5-year contracts. So that's kind of the longest duration that the market typically offers, which is where we prefer to be right now. And we're able to place them at a 30 basis point spread above where the curve is. And I think we've talked about for a long time in this marketplace, there really were no spreads to the curve and sometimes they're even discounts. So I think that's probably the most empirical data that the demand is out there is strong. And you see similar demand on the floating rate side as well. On the second part of your question, the opportunity to accelerate really aren\u2019t there. It\u2019s kind of the nature of a fixed rate contract, right, for the same reason on both sides of the equation from a bank liquidity standpoint where they get it on their side. It\u2019s not a very common thing. So I wouldn\u2019t expect any opportunities to accelerate it. But as you noted, we have -- when you look at the year, we\u2019ve got $6.5 billion coming up. And if you look at the marketplace right now, we\u2019d be able to place them in even higher rates. And if that 5-year point is available, we\u2019ll be excited to do it there as well. So market is good, but acceleration opportunity is probably not there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe just a question on the prudential expenses. First, I just wanted to confirm that the $125 million of the integration and onboarding expenses in the promotional line are one-time and still expected to entirely roll off by the start of 2025. And then can you just help frame the size of the incremental G&A growth we should think about in \u201825 either on a percentage basis year-on-year or framing relative to the size of the Pru expenses in promo that will be rolling off in '24.\nMatt Audette: Yes. Sure, Kyle. I mean I think on the $125 million, yes, they are definitely one-time and specific to bringing Prudential on board. I think the majority of them will be in 2024. So if you look at what we spent so far in '23, it's in the $25 million, $26 million range. Of that remaining $100 million that will primarily be in '24. But just depending on the timing of when they come on board, some of that could flow over into 2025. Now the total amount wouldn't change. It's just a -- it would still be $125 million. It could -- some of it could just go into 2025, but the majority would be in 2024. On the core G&A front, I think the headline I would give you in kind of emphasized in the prepared remarks that the amount we expect in 2024 is relatively small, and it's all about the timing of when they come on board. I think to your question of how to dimension it, I think I'd just go back to the estimated EBITDA when it's fully ramped, which is around $60 million. And maybe just look at overall margins in our business around 50%, that should give you a sense of the overall expenses. That would go along with it. So I think if you did something like that, you'd be directionally correct. I'd just emphasize that it's -- from a cost standpoint, it's likely to be primarily in 2025, just given the timing of when they're going to come on board is towards the end of '24.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And then just on the follow-up, if you just ask on the M&A environment, we're seeing a macro backdrop now that I expect to be more favorable for M&A in the sector. Markets are at all-time highs. We're starting to see some clarity on interest rates, at least relative to the past year or two. So just wondering if you could speak to the opportunities you're seeing in the market, whether bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers maybe narrowing and the number of -- or types of deals that you're seeing come across your desk now versus maybe this time last year?\nDan Arnold: Let me take a stab at that one. It's Dan and hopefully, I'll get all your questions inside of there. So I think, as you know, M&A remains a core part of our strategy complement to our organic growth opportunities. And to your question, we focus on three primary categories of opportunities. One is, first to grow in our market. So potential acquisitions might include both broker-dealers and RIAs. Examples of that are our Boenning & Scattergood\u2019s acquisition, Waddell & Reed acquisition and then Crown Capital, which we're closing earlier this year. So those are good examples of how we might look across the marketplace for those opportunities. And look, as the industry continues to consolidate, we would expect to be a participant in that consolidation. The second type of transactions that we\u2019ll look at is to add capabilities and these are capabilities where we would ultimately evaluate, allocate and should we allocate capital to build, buy or partner. And to the extent this accelerates our desire to create that vertically integrated, feature-rich platform and, this is where we would look to an opportunity like that. As capability transactions would include advisory world and delays. And to remind you, delays a trading platform that we're turning in to what we think will be a really industry-leading trading and rebalancing tool that we're making available to our entire client base in early in the spring. So excited about that type of transaction and what we can do with it. The third type of category or example of a transaction would be deploying capital against this newest capability of liquidity and succession. Certainly gives us a path for our capital work in a way that both meets our disciplined return thresholds and then helps both internal and external advisors solve a really important question around this succession needs and requirements that we've talked a lot about over the next 10 years. And again, I think in doing that, it positions us well to not only do that for internal advisors, but also to potentially create that solution for those that aren't part of our enterprise today. So if you just summarize all of that, we consider M&A opportunities, a core part of our strategy, but we will remain disciplined to make sure that the framework with which we assess them as they benefit strategically, financially, culturally and operationally, and we\u2019ll do it with good discipline around each of these two. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. A question for Dan. I was interested by the comments you made about some of the new service innovations and really to encourage advisors to move and, I guess, move to LPL. And I guess I took that more as LPL looking to win more advisors in motion. But if I look at industry churn, it's been pretty anchored at 5% to 6% in recent history. So I'm just curious, based on what you just talked about, whether it's some of the innovations in the services portfolio or just that you're seeing more broadly occurring in the industry that could really change that 5% to 6% rate, and it would seem like it would be a pretty big deal, if you can. So just love to get a sense of kind of what those innovations actually mean? And then can that rate move for either LPL reasons or industry reasons?\nDan Arnold: Yes, good question. So I think if we just sort of start with the first question around churn or that movement in the marketplace. And we continue to see advisor movement will remain flat. Think about that in the range of 5%, 5.5% over the other part of the last couple of years, which is you know is below historical norms. Now there has been some mix shift in that turnover where it's coming from. In fact, in the last year, you've seen movement in the traditional independent market move up where there's been a slowdown as an example from the wires. That said, notwithstanding all of that, I think we first and foremost look at our overall win rates or what is moving across all of our different affiliation models as a way to continue to understand their absolute appeal as well as their hopefully growing appeal as we invest more into the platform or the model. And as we said earlier, despite this lower movement in advisors. If you look at the relative market share, we're picking up in our win rates, you've seen those increase over the past three years with that investment back into the model. And I think look, for the newer models, not only do we have higher opportunities to enhance the capability set there as they're on a -- just a pressure journey, if you will, in terms of our investment capabilities there. Also, their seasoning, the growing awareness and credibility they have in the marketplace can also be a catalyst for higher win rates there. So it's not just even the investment. It's that it's growing seasoning around our right to win, if you will, with those new models. And then finally, to your point, I think one of the things that we look at is we can't completely control the movement of advisors in the marketplace. What could we do to contribute to it in this notion of concept making it easier to help an advisor move from one practice to another, given that being what we believe is one of the big hurdles for advisors moving, boy, if you could solve that or begin to break that down and imagine that in different ways and thus create a much different rubric, if you will, for the change management effort sort of associated to moving the A to B that, that could be a real catalyst to increase that movement in the industry. And so that's the question I think we're trying to explore and that I alluded to in my remarks, and we're using our services portfolio and some of the ways at which we've learned how to add value to advisors and helping them operate, fund their practices and realize that we tweak them a bit and offered them while someone is going through a conversion, that actually could be a catalyst to making easier to go through that change management. And thus, it's successful at doing that more structurally, but then you could see the knock-on effect, if you will, of potentially accelerating the movement in this industry. And with our ability to recruit and our positioning of our models in the marketplace, certainly, that's a strategic opportunity for us. So that's how we pulled that together. I hope that color added some little...\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Thanks, Dan. That's great color. And I guess my follow-up is just it's interrelated to that. So terrific momentum in recruited assets in 2023 and really the new affiliation models are clearly resonating in the market. And I believe you said $15 billion from those new channels in 2023. So that would seem to imply. I mean the legacy channels would be around $50 billion to get to the $67 billion total, if I'm correct there. So on the new affiliation channels, the contribution continues to scale and those mature, should that look like something similar to, call it, the $50 billion from the legacy channels? Or I'm just trying to size because they're growing so quickly, kind of what they look like at maybe maturity or something that's more mature like or maybe it's well above $50 billion, but just want to get some thoughts on kind of where we're coming from to where we're going just because there has been such a tremendous growth there, especially when you split it out separately.\nDan Arnold: Yes. It's a great question. And I think as we think about those longer terms and what is that possibility, I think we start with the size of each of those markets. And that we've broken down in the employee base market is the largest one of all in that $11 trillion to $12 trillion range or RIA in the second. And then -- and then the sort of Swiss model that we have is a subset, if you will, typically those coming out of an employee-based model. And so, if you think about the opportunities that associated with those, I think you would start with that broader market and then you begin to then drill down on -- what's our right to win? What's our ability to win. What are the capabilities necessary to continue to grow our win rates inside those markets. And then if you do that, it's reason to believe, given the size of those markets relative to the traditional independent that even if we achieve half of the win rate or the success rates, we do on our traditional independent channel that those begin to make sizable contributions that as you were estimating -- look more like the contribution on the independent side. So what I'm not suggesting is we'll get there. What I am suggesting is that's an opportunity that it is for the continuing to work into, invest into and challenge ourselves to achieve the type of win rates we have on the independent side in these large markets. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: This quarter saw the biggest kind of quarter-over-quarter increase in sales-based commissions, looks to be somewhat driven by annuities. So curious about your outlook for that and in the context of what the DOL has proposed, how you think that might change behavior or not going forward?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Let me take that one. Thanks for the question. We have seen some momentum, frankly, since rates have gone up, but you've seen the interesting growth in the utilization and probably predictable growth in the utilization of fixed annuities. And then when the equity markets move and have volatility in them, and variable annuities can also be interesting opportunity to deploy capital. And so I think it's been a nice tailwind for annuities for the better part of the year -- last year plus. And you're exactly right, fourth quarter just reinforced that. I think as we go forward, the question around the DOL is a good one relative to brokerage and advisory. And I think as we think about that, we go back to our playbook we used in '15 and '16 timeframe where -- as from a principal standpoint, we believe that maintaining choice for advisors' clients is in their best interest and our interest in making sure that we do the things necessary to preserve the choice for advisors between brokerage and advisory and our ability to ensure that we can help them adequately do that as the rules change relative to Reg BI. And then again, if the DOL rule ultimately goes through and changes that slightly making sure that we're prepared to help them pivot where they can successfully continue to do that business where it's in the best interest of the clients. And I think hard to argue with making sure that you provide people choice and then ultimately enable those advisors to serve them and offering need to clients. That said, I do believe that in many cases, annuities will continue to be used where they're needed, where they make sense as a rollover option or where they make sense in helping someone as we talked about earlier, with downside protection, it's still participating in the upside for the equity markets, there's good places to use them. I think that -- what we will see though is in other areas, you'll probably see a bigger shift to the utilization of advisory. It's just tougher to do brokerage business. There may be some places, small accounts, there may be other scenarios where given the two options, the advisor ultimately utilize the advisory solution. We're still in the best interest of the client, but also just in the spirit of making sure the business can be done in a better and efficient way. So we do believe that's a trend. Hence, the investments in our advisory platforms, vertical integration we have around our advisor offering, again, lines up well with structural change as well. So put a capstone on it. We will and make sure that we're positioned to enable brokers to continue to be used. I do think that the DOL rule would create some headwind on the percentage of brokerage business that we see. -- but it won't be a complete change. You'll still see it utilized for some current rate.\nDan Fannon: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, I think, Dan, you mentioned 99% retention in 2023. And then Matt, you called out January a couple of departures. So just curious if we can get some context around maybe what happens in January? And if you think retention might be slightly different given the environment as we think about 2024 more broadly.\nDan Arnold: Yes. No, our sense of it is, look, we got to make sure we execute on our strategy. We've got to invest in our capabilities, and we've got to deliver attempt to deliver an extraordinary experience on a daily basis. We have solid trends there, strengthening NPS scores, evolving capability. We expect that retention rate in that 98.5% range to 99% range to be a good way to think about our good centering point, if you will, on retention for this year outside of the example of what Matt used, where someone sells the practice to potentially solve for succession solution. And look, that was the trigger that we launched our liquidity and succession program a year ago, gave us a great opportunity to go solve that really important question that many advisors had. Those two examples, maybe we didn't launch ours and time enough to get a swing at those. And though we won't win them all, we do believe we've got a really appealing differentiated solution that will position us well, not only to help serve our clients that are already on our platform, but actually use it as a way to attract new assets to the platform because not only do we have a rich value proposition that we serve and support the daily needs, we also can help them with their succession. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re [indiscernible].\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays.\nBen Budish: I think most of might have already kind of been covered, but maybe just one for Matt on the core G&A growth. Can you just talk a little bit about what gets you to the high or low end of the range? It sounds like the potential ramp is going to be not too impactful for this year. So what are the sort of factors that could drive that up or down? And at what point in the year do you start to get a better sense of where that shakes out?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think what typically drives us within the range is the costs associated with supporting the growth that happens during the year. I think if you look at Q4 of \u201823 of this quarter is a good example where we came in within our range, but at the high end of the range, and that was really about the variable costs associated with growing, whether its variable compensation associated with that growth of the direct cost to ramp up. So that\u2019s typically the driver within that range, those things.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys : I just wanted to come back to, Dan, some of your comments earlier just around the movement of advisors across the industry that you alluded to. Curious what's driving that? What might change that at the industry level? I hear you on some of the services portfolio innovations that can help move it in your favor for you guys, but just at the macro backdrop for the broader industry. Just curious what might lead that churn to pick up here versus slow down even further? And then how do you see the sort of backdrop evolving if interest rates are cut?\nDan Arnold: Yes, yes, good questions. Look, I do think you've got a number of different things that might create a slight headwind on movement than at the aggregate had brought it down from I don't know, historically, 7% kind of range for movement. And we would expect things to return and normalize over a period of time. These little headwinds that I referenced, some of it is still a bit of a hangover from COVID and just some of the change in complexity that was created as people work through that, I think, is one. I think a second one is you just got -- you've had a volatile market with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty that surrounds it and advisors avoid sometimes making big strategic moves or pivots or adjustments in periods of time where they've really got to be focused on the clients, and they don't want to create more change in the midst of uncertainty. And I think that's been something that we've seen over the last couple of years that have created some uncertainty. And I also think you see advisors also pivoting in a new world of how do they operate post pandemic? What they learned from that? What pressures does it put on their practices; the growing complexity of regulations may drive up costs? The whole digitalization of their businesses and their offices and what does that mean? And how do they think about what is the best partner for them going forward? What are the types of services that are new to them to transform their practice? I think just trying to assess what those options and alternatives are in a world that's flipped on the side. And now you throw AI on top of that, which in the short run, creates lots of noise and exuberance. Unfortunately, it's also a shiny penny that sometimes doesn't always lead to good productive outcomes. And so I think as we get further down the road of assimilating some order to the house being flipped on its side in some cases and helping them really see where they can use technology really wisely to drive productivity with again, either leverage tools or outsource risk management to lower their costs associated with a world that's getting tougher and tougher from a regulatory standpoint, where they really do think about, hey, how do I drive growth? And what do I need in my value proposition to do that? How do I leverage folks to do? I think those are some of the interesting questions that is they're able to solve those. It enables them to move forward in a little more informed way and thus at a faster pace. So those are some of the little, I think, skirmishes, if you will, that we're trying -- we\u2019re overcoming as we go forward in time. It will help return maybe movement back to a more normal 7%.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just as a follow-up question for Matt. On promotional expense. If I adjust for the large enterprise one-timers over the past couple of years, it looks like the underlying promo expense has been in the mid- to high teens. Does that sound about right to you? And arguably, that's in the context of high singles organic growth. So another question there. If we expect that sort of organic growth to persist in the high singles. Should we expect a similar mid- to high teens pace of underlying promotional expense going forward, excluding the large one-timers?\nMatt Audette: Well, I think the -- probably the best way to think about it is just hone in on the key drivers of the growth. And I\u2019d put it in three categories, which could have different trends. I think the first is organic growth overall. That\u2019s typically the biggest driver and the TA associated with bringing recruiting on board is a driver of that. So the amount of recruiting that we do is really the driver there. TA rates really have not -- have been fairly stable, haven\u2019t changed recently. So I think where recruiting goes is where that would go. The second is conference spend, and conference spend more kind of trends with the overall number of advisors that we have at LPL, right? They\u2019re really important part of how we engage with them, how they engage with each other. So as the firm scales, you could expect that spend to scale. And then lastly, as you highlighted, it\u2019s really the onboarding expenses associated with those large enterprises. So that really can be a little bit hard to predict because it depends on the firms that come on board. Prudential is a great example. We\u2019ve got good insight into spending in \u201824 and good insight into spending overall to bring that on board. It just depends on what happens on the other side of it. So I\u2019d really put it into those three categories, that kind of trend differently each. It just depends on how those three things play out.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan.\nMichael Cho: I just want to touch on enterprise quickly again. And I have just a quick two-parter here. You talked about a healthy pipeline and sort of an uptick in conversations, since the Prudential announcement. But in terms of kind of looking ahead, I mean, does the Prudential onboarding limit your bandwidth at all do more Prudential type deals? And then second, just longer term looking beyond Prudential, I mean, how should we think about framing the potential benefits to LPL's operating scale and leverage as you continue to gain critical mass within the enterprise opportunity set?\nDan Arnold: I'll take the first one, Matt. So, look, on the first one, I think we see an interesting pipeline on both sides of that enterprise channel. As I said before, banks and on the insurance/product manufacturer related market space. And with that portfolio, comes the continued opportunity, right, to continue to explore and learn, both how we're doing with existing programs and how that drives innovation to create more appeal in them. Second is every time you bring one on, how do you create a more automated and have a better playbook to be more efficient at doing that, so you can do that better and faster and more economically for the lower cost. And, so I would tell you we're much better than we were three years ago when we brought our first larger enterprises on and we continue to automate more and more of that kind of change management onboarding effort process. And as you rightfully said, to the success that you're able to do that, not only are you going to create more interesting economic outcomes by lowering the amount of investment upfront in these opportunities, you also can bring them on at a faster pace. And so I think we're working our way into being able to be very thoughtful about how we bring these on in an orderly fashion assuring that first and foremost we get the experience right, that you continue to operate your existing platform at the level that you want to. And then if you're, as you, again, get better and better at that, I think you can line those up and bring those in a faster and faster pace. And that's what we're challenging ourselves to do without being overly precise in exactly how that would look or what that looks like. I think we get, again, to challenge ourselves with pragmatic opportunities to think, how do you shorten that onboarding and change management effort? So that's the problem you can solve. Matt, do you want to get?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think the answer is a resounding yes on other benefits to scale. I think when you look at just starting high level with the overall value proposition of this channel and the things that we're building. You're bringing on clients where they're once they're on their platform, a big part of the attraction is getting access to our capabilities and allowing them to grow that channel faster on our platforms, you get a place where you're increasing your levels of organic growth. I think maybe to the core of your question on the cost side, in each of these instances, you're typically building out capabilities or technology that's really important to that particular enterprise, but they're usually applicable to others as well, right. So you're not only making sure that you have the ability to serve and support that particular client that you're bringing on, but you're usually enhancing, those capabilities for things that the rest of LPL or the rest of this channel would like. And I think Pru is a very good example of that. We're not only bringing on capabilities specific to Prudential, we're building out a platform that can actually open up a much larger channel for us, and to recruit more on. So a headline point is there's certainly scale benefits and hopefully those examples are helpful.\nOperator: And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Yes. And I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2023. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisors and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities. We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients and continue to make progress with our liquidity and succession solution. So as we enter 2024, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to serve and support our more than 22,000 advisors, while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 9% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity wins. Total organic net new assets were $25 billion or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our total for the year to $80 billion. Looking ahead to Q1, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.51. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, down $3 million sequentially. Our payout rate was 87.6%, up 30 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production moves. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 86.5% as the production bonus resets at the beginning of each year. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $374 million, down $4 million from Q3 as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Client cash balances ended the quarter at $48 billion, up $1 billion sequentially, marking the first quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2022. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances ended the quarter at roughly 60%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q4, there were roughly $2.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed $2 billion of these maturing balances into new 5-year contracts, yielding approximately 415 basis points, which is roughly 85 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 317 basis points in Q4, down 1 basis point from Q3. As for Q1, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points. As for service and fee revenue, it was $131 million in Q4, down $5 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference room fee following our largest advisor conference of the year in Q3 as well as seasonally lower IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by approximately $5 million sequentially on lower conference room. Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $54 million, up $4 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q1, based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple of million sequentially. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.369 billion. This was within our outlook range and for the full year, represents approximately 15% growth. As a reminder, this included an opportunistic 5% of incremental spend focused on accelerating our capabilities as we took advantage of the favorable macro environment. Now, as we look ahead to 2024, we plan to return to more normalized levels of spend, concentrating on investments that enable organic growth and drive operating leverage in our business. In addition, our ongoing investments to scale our business are driving greater efficiencies. Pulling this together, we expect our 2024 core G&A growth rate to be roughly half the rate we saw in 2023. More specifically, we intend to grow 2024 core G&A in a range of 6.25% to 8.75%. As for Q1, we expect core G&A to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Note that this core G&A spend is prior to expenses associated with Prudential. As we move closer to onboarding them towards the end of this year, we'll provide an update on 2024 core G&A. I would just emphasize that we expect only a small amount of spend in 2024 as the majority of these costs will be incurred in 2025. Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $138 million, down $2 million sequentially. As lower conference spend was partially offset by higher prudential related onboarding and integration costs. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect promotional expense to be roughly flat as we have one of our largest advisor conferences during the quarter, which will be offset by seasonal declines in marketing spend. As for regulatory expense, it was $9 million in Q4. Looking forward, given the increased size and scale of our business, we would expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $16 million in Q4, flat compared to Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $6 million sequentially, as Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock boards. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $184 million. I would note that during the quarter, we completed our first investment-grade debt offer, issuing $750 million of senior notes. With that, our leverage ratio increased to 1.6x and is within our target leverage range of 1.5x to 2.5x. Turning to how we deploy that capital. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q4, we deployed capital across our entire frame as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders repurchasing $225 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q1, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute our $2 billion authorization over two years. Turning now to interest expense. It was $54 million in Q4, up $6 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $7 million from Q4. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes, Steven, I'll give you some color here, but the answer is going to be the latter. I think the investments are moderated and our confidence and conviction around continuing to drive organic growth is just the same. Now the details below that, just building a little bit on what I shared in the prepared remarks, the cost strategy or investment strategy remains driving investments prioritizing to drive organic growth, as well as driving productivity and efficiency. And I think what's probably most relevant in this conversation is also adapting as the environment evolves. So if you look at, to your point, on 2023 and growing 15%. You kind of break that into -- that 15% into three equal categories of about 5% each. The first was really about serving and supporting the core business growth. The second was about continuing to make investments to really improve our value prop, through and establish ourselves in the new models and addressable market to scale our services, things of that nature. And that third category, that third 5% was really just being opportunistic about the market really accelerating investments. And I think when you look at the guidance for 2024, our plans for 2024, it's really pulling back in that third category. So we're continuing to make the investments that support growth. We're continuing to make the investments to improve our value proposition and capabilities in just those two things, and this may get really to the core of your question, that would typically lead to core G&A growth in the 8% to 10% range. But then you put on top of that, the investments we're making for productivity and efficiency which do create capacity to invest each and every year are getting even better. And it's that final point that brings us down to the 6.25% to 8.75%. So hopefully, the color helped there, but I think the headline point is our conviction on continuing to deliver organic growth in this high single-digits remains. Yes. I think I'll start on cash. I mean the headline is we really saw a cash start to stabilize back in July. So really, if you look at the second half of the year, even by the months, we ended the year at a pretty similar level of where we ended July. So I think what we're seeing in January is really a continuation of that stability. So just a reminder, the seasonal factor that does hit in January is advisory fees typically hit primarily in the first month of the quarter. So we -- so those do reduce cash balances. It's around $1.2 billion. Outside of that though, we've continued to see stability. So the amount of cash balance moving from customer activity was actually a slight increase in January. So you put that together and cash balances overall for the month are down $1.2 billion, but it's primarily driven by those fees and the activity is actually a slight increase. So I think headline is continuing to see stability on the cash sweep side. On the organic growth side, and maybe just -- I'll give a little bit of context and perspective on the overall quarter as well as the month of January. To your point on your first question, when you look at the last 3, 4 years of really driving and delivering that high single-digit organic growth, given the nature of Q1, the first quarter is usually a little bit lower. So in those years, it was typically in the 6% to 7% zone. So if we look at what we're seeing for Q1 '24, is really delivering something in a similar place, that's 6% to 7%. The only thing I would highlight and the reason for this color is we would expect January to actually be a little bit lower than normal in the 1% to 2% zone, and then February and March actually to be higher than typical, really at those high single-digits, really coming together at a 6% to 7% for the quarter. And really, the reason for that is that the seasonal factors that we just talked about on the cash sweep side, meaning advisory fees hitting in the first month of the quarter as well as you have on the NNA front, that normal slowdown in the first half of January because of the FINRA closing in the second half of December as well as advisors taking time off. You have those normal factors that come through in January. Two things I would highlight, though, for this January. First is recruiting. Our recruiting continues to be strong. You may recall, Q1 of last year, we set a new record in recruiting prior to large enterprises at around $13 billion. We're on track to exceed that in the first quarter this year. So continued strength there, just the timing is a little shifted more towards February and March. So you got a little bit of weakness in January. And then on the attrition side, a little bit of the opposite and that attrition is going to be a little bit heavier in January versus February and March, as we had two practices that were acquired to part during the month. And that's normal. It happens from time to time. We just happen to have two in a single month in January. Outside of that, our retention remains consistently high with the levels we've seen. So lots of color there, but I would headline it in, we're looking at Q1 and continuing in that 6% to 7% zone. And you're just going to have a little bit of a different shape to the quarter with January in that 1% to 2% zone. Yes, Alex, I think on the demand, the demand is strong. Like if you look at the $2 billion that we did place into new contracts towards the end of the quarter, we're able to place them in 5-year contracts. So that's kind of the longest duration that the market typically offers, which is where we prefer to be right now. And we're able to place them at a 30 basis point spread above where the curve is. And I think we've talked about for a long time in this marketplace, there really were no spreads to the curve and sometimes they're even discounts. So I think that's probably the most empirical data that the demand is out there is strong. And you see similar demand on the floating rate side as well. On the second part of your question, the opportunity to accelerate really aren't there. It's kind of the nature of a fixed rate contract, right, for the same reason on both sides of the equation from a bank liquidity standpoint where they get it on their side. It's not a very common thing. So I wouldn't expect any opportunities to accelerate it. But as you noted, we have -- when you look at the year, we've got $6.5 billion coming up. And if you look at the marketplace right now, we'd be able to place them in even higher rates. And if that 5-year point is available, we'll be excited to do it there as well. So market is good, but acceleration opportunity is probably not there. Yes. Sure, Kyle. I mean I think on the $125 million, yes, they are definitely one-time and specific to bringing Prudential on board. I think the majority of them will be in 2024. So if you look at what we spent so far in '23, it's in the $25 million, $26 million range. Of that remaining $100 million that will primarily be in '24. But just depending on the timing of when they come on board, some of that could flow over into 2025. Now the total amount wouldn't change. It's just a -- it would still be $125 million. It could -- some of it could just go into 2025, but the majority would be in 2024. On the core G&A front, I think the headline I would give you in kind of emphasized in the prepared remarks that the amount we expect in 2024 is relatively small, and it's all about the timing of when they come on board. I think to your question of how to dimension it, I think I'd just go back to the estimated EBITDA when it's fully ramped, which is around $60 million. And maybe just look at overall margins in our business around 50%, that should give you a sense of the overall expenses. That would go along with it. So I think if you did something like that, you'd be directionally correct. I'd just emphasize that it's -- from a cost standpoint, it's likely to be primarily in 2025, just given the timing of when they're going to come on board is towards the end of '24. Yes. I think what typically drives us within the range is the costs associated with supporting the growth that happens during the year. I think if you look at Q4 of \u201823 of this quarter is a good example where we came in within our range, but at the high end of the range, and that was really about the variable costs associated with growing, whether its variable compensation associated with that growth of the direct cost to ramp up. So that's typically the driver within that range, those things. Well, I think the -- probably the best way to think about it is just hone in on the key drivers of the growth. And I'd put it in three categories, which could have different trends. I think the first is organic growth overall. That's typically the biggest driver and the TA associated with bringing recruiting on board is a driver of that. So the amount of recruiting that we do is really the driver there. TA rates really have not -- have been fairly stable, haven't changed recently. So I think where recruiting goes is where that would go. The second is conference spend, and conference spend more kind of trends with the overall number of advisors that we have at LPL, right? They're really important part of how we engage with them, how they engage with each other. So as the firm scales, you could expect that spend to scale. And then lastly, as you highlighted, it's really the onboarding expenses associated with those large enterprises. So that really can be a little bit hard to predict because it depends on the firms that come on board. Prudential is a great example. We've got good insight into spending in \u201824 and good insight into spending overall to bring that on board. It just depends on what happens on the other side of it. So I'd really put it into those three categories, that kind of trend differently each. It just depends on how those three things play out. Yes. I think the answer is a resounding yes on other benefits to scale. I think when you look at just starting high level with the overall value proposition of this channel and the things that we're building. You're bringing on clients where they're once they're on their platform, a big part of the attraction is getting access to our capabilities and allowing them to grow that channel faster on our platforms, you get a place where you're increasing your levels of organic growth. I think maybe to the core of your question on the cost side, in each of these instances, you're typically building out capabilities or technology that's really important to that particular enterprise, but they're usually applicable to others as well, right. So you're not only making sure that you have the ability to serve and support that particular client that you're bringing on, but you're usually enhancing, those capabilities for things that the rest of LPL or the rest of this channel would like. And I think Pru is a very good example of that. We're not only bringing on capabilities specific to Prudential, we're building out a platform that can actually open up a much larger channel for us, and to recruit more on. So a headline point is there's certainly scale benefits and hopefully those examples are helpful."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Amy, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2023, our advisors continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. As we enter the new year, we thank our advisors for their continued commitment and dedication while we remain focused on our mission of taking care of them so they can take care of their clients. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, fourth quarter organic net new assets were $25 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets for the year of $100 billion, representing approximately 9%. In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion, bringing our total for the full year to $80 billion. Prior to large enterprises, recruited assets for the full year were $67 billion, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year and a new annual record. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients. The combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q4. At the same time, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the full year was approximately 99%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.51, which brought our full year total to $15.72, an increase of 36% year-over-year. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the advisor-centered market. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisors' success throughout the life cycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate with us such that we compete all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace; and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services that help our advisors differentiate win in the marketplace, be great operators of the business. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the fourth quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent fund, adding approximately $14 billion in assets. As a result of the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered our strongest year-to-date, recruiting roughly $15 billion in assets, nearly double the total of the prior year. As we look ahead, we expect the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and our ongoing enhancements to their capabilities will help drive sustained increase in their growth. Next, the traditional bank and credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of accreted assets in Q4. In addition, large enterprises remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2023 with the addition of Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. For 2024, we continue to prepare to onboard the retail wealth management business of potential financial. Now as a part of that process, our team has been on the road meeting with potential advisors to provide them a preliminary orientation to our platform, and the early feedback has been positive. Looking ahead, we are confident that the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises, match with our track record of successful execution, positions us well to help solve the needs of a broad spectrum of institutions. Now within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on investing back into the model in order to deliver a comprehensive platform capability, services and technology that help our advisors differentiated win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As part of this effort, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress on our aspiration of delivering an industry-leading services. This work includes continuing to make our service model more flexible and efficient through a multichannel approach. The purposes of which is to offer a broad spectrum of service options including human-centric support, digital capabilities and artificial intelligence such that we can provide advisors the information they need and the channel that works best for them. In that spirit, over the last year, we have continued to expand our digital capabilities, including our digital hubs, which provides advisors always on support in centralized and intuitive format. Our investments in this area enabled us to expand from 2 digital hubs to 11 over the last year, with the newest being our Tax Hub, which helps advisors process tax business in a streamlined and highly efficient way. While we are still in the early innings of the adoption of this capability set, the percentage of advisors' interactions that go through digital channels has roughly doubled over the last year from 10% to 20%. And as we continue to refine these capabilities, we believe that digital solutions can ultimately serve as much as 50% of our service interactions. Now as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our service portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of our capability. And as a result of solid demand, the number of advisors utilizing our portfolio of over 14 available services, continues to increase, and we ended the year with nearly 3,900 active users, up 27% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we remain focused on addressing the needs of a broader set of advisors and are innovating on new services that will directionally double the size of our services portfolio over the next two years. And one of the latest innovations in our services portfolio was inspired by our broader efforts to tackle the advisor transition process, which has historically been an industry-wide pain point given the friction and complexity of changing firm. That said, rather than seeing the transition process as a headwind, we view it as an important strategic opportunity. As the easier we can make it for advisors to change firms, the more it will drive up advisor movement in the industry, where we are well-positioned to benefit the market leader in recruiting. To help solve for that opportunity, we have developed several new transition capabilities and solutions, including live testing environment for advisors to familiarize themselves with our platform board transition, fully automated stages of the onboarding process and the suite of transition services that includes short-term admin, branding and bookkeeping support, which helps simplify the transition and onboarding journey and ultimately accelerate advisor's readiness and growth. Early feedback on these transition services has been positive, and they are proving to be a catalyst for additional subscriptions as 40% of advisors who use these solutions end up subscribing for one or more of our other ongoing services. And as we move forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to solve for advisors' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect business for themselves and ultimately maximize their systems. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their [indiscernible] while driving growth and increasing our marketplace. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiated win in the marketplace and as a result, have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, with respect to our large enterprise channel, we opened this market up back in 2020 with a novel outsourcing solution. And initially, we targeted larger banks. And we have seen some success up to this point, capturing about $85 billion of assets to our platform. If you look at the total market for banks and outsourcing of wealth management for wealth management, it's roughly in and around $1 trillion. We believe our experience, reputation and capability set, it's a compelling solution that helps continue to strengthen that pipeline and offer up an interesting durable growth opportunity as we move forward. That said, at the same time, we took our solution that was targeted to banks and we made some additional investments and capabilities and personalized options, which enabled us to extend the appeal of that model to, as you said, the insurance companies or product manufacturers that operate wealth management solutions. And now that market represents an additional $1.5 trillion of opportunity. And with the Prudential announcement, it was a catalyst for additional inquiries, exploring the question. So why aren't they outsourcing? And we continue to progress in these discussions and explore others. They're still in the early stages, but we do believe this part of the pipeline will continue to evolve as well. So if I summarize it, as we move forward, we believe our market leadership capability set and a real deep IT for this enterprise channel creates a really unique growth opportunity for us. We're excited about it. Let me take a stab at that one. It's Dan and hopefully, I'll get all your questions inside of there. So I think, as you know, M&A remains a core part of our strategy complement to our organic growth opportunities. And to your question, we focus on three primary categories of opportunities. One is, first to grow in our market. So potential acquisitions might include both broker-dealers and RIAs. Examples of that are our Boenning & Scattergood's acquisition, Waddell & Reed acquisition and then Crown Capital, which we're closing earlier this year. So those are good examples of how we might look across the marketplace for those opportunities. And look, as the industry continues to consolidate, we would expect to be a participant in that consolidation. The second type of transactions that we'll look at is to add capabilities and these are capabilities where we would ultimately evaluate, allocate and should we allocate capital to build, buy or partner. And to the extent this accelerates our desire to create that vertically integrated, feature-rich platform and, this is where we would look to an opportunity like that. As capability transactions would include advisory world and delays. And to remind you, delays a trading platform that we're turning in to what we think will be a really industry-leading trading and rebalancing tool that we're making available to our entire client base in early in the spring. So excited about that type of transaction and what we can do with it. The third type of category or example of a transaction would be deploying capital against this newest capability of liquidity and succession. Certainly gives us a path for our capital work in a way that both meets our disciplined return thresholds and then helps both internal and external advisors solve a really important question around this succession needs and requirements that we've talked a lot about over the next 10 years. And again, I think in doing that, it positions us well to not only do that for internal advisors, but also to potentially create that solution for those that aren't part of our enterprise today. So if you just summarize all of that, we consider M&A opportunities, a core part of our strategy, but we will remain disciplined to make sure that the framework with which we assess them as they benefit strategically, financially, culturally and operationally, and we'll do it with good discipline around each of these two. I hope that helps. Yes, good question. So I think if we just sort of start with the first question around churn or that movement in the marketplace. And we continue to see advisor movement will remain flat. Think about that in the range of 5%, 5.5% over the other part of the last couple of years, which is you know is below historical norms. Now there has been some mix shift in that turnover where it's coming from. In fact, in the last year, you've seen movement in the traditional independent market move up where there's been a slowdown as an example from the wires. That said, notwithstanding all of that, I think we first and foremost look at our overall win rates or what is moving across all of our different affiliation models as a way to continue to understand their absolute appeal as well as their hopefully growing appeal as we invest more into the platform or the model. And as we said earlier, despite this lower movement in advisors. If you look at the relative market share, we're picking up in our win rates, you've seen those increase over the past three years with that investment back into the model. And I think look, for the newer models, not only do we have higher opportunities to enhance the capability set there as they're on a -- just a pressure journey, if you will, in terms of our investment capabilities there. Also, their seasoning, the growing awareness and credibility they have in the marketplace can also be a catalyst for higher win rates there. So it's not just even the investment. It's that it's growing seasoning around our right to win, if you will, with those new models. And then finally, to your point, I think one of the things that we look at is we can't completely control the movement of advisors in the marketplace. What could we do to contribute to it in this notion of concept making it easier to help an advisor move from one practice to another, given that being what we believe is one of the big hurdles for advisors moving, boy, if you could solve that or begin to break that down and imagine that in different ways and thus create a much different rubric, if you will, for the change management effort sort of associated to moving the A to B that, that could be a real catalyst to increase that movement in the industry. And so that's the question I think we're trying to explore and that I alluded to in my remarks, and we're using our services portfolio and some of the ways at which we've learned how to add value to advisors and helping them operate, fund their practices and realize that we tweak them a bit and offered them while someone is going through a conversion, that actually could be a catalyst to making easier to go through that change management. And thus, it's successful at doing that more structurally, but then you could see the knock-on effect, if you will, of potentially accelerating the movement in this industry. And with our ability to recruit and our positioning of our models in the marketplace, certainly, that's a strategic opportunity for us. So that's how we pulled that together. I hope that color added some little... Yes. It's a great question. And I think as we think about those longer terms and what is that possibility, I think we start with the size of each of those markets. And that we've broken down in the employee base market is the largest one of all in that $11 trillion to $12 trillion range or RIA in the second. And then -- and then the sort of Swiss model that we have is a subset, if you will, typically those coming out of an employee-based model. And so, if you think about the opportunities that associated with those, I think you would start with that broader market and then you begin to then drill down on -- what's our right to win? What's our ability to win. What are the capabilities necessary to continue to grow our win rates inside those markets. And then if you do that, it's reason to believe, given the size of those markets relative to the traditional independent that even if we achieve half of the win rate or the success rates, we do on our traditional independent channel that those begin to make sizable contributions that as you were estimating -- look more like the contribution on the independent side. So what I'm not suggesting is we'll get there. What I am suggesting is that's an opportunity that it is for the continuing to work into, invest into and challenge ourselves to achieve the type of win rates we have on the independent side in these large markets. I hope that helps. Yes. Let me take that one. Thanks for the question. We have seen some momentum, frankly, since rates have gone up, but you've seen the interesting growth in the utilization and probably predictable growth in the utilization of fixed annuities. And then when the equity markets move and have volatility in them, and variable annuities can also be interesting opportunity to deploy capital. And so I think it's been a nice tailwind for annuities for the better part of the year -- last year plus. And you're exactly right, fourth quarter just reinforced that. I think as we go forward, the question around the DOL is a good one relative to brokerage and advisory. And I think as we think about that, we go back to our playbook we used in '15 and '16 timeframe where -- as from a principal standpoint, we believe that maintaining choice for advisors' clients is in their best interest and our interest in making sure that we do the things necessary to preserve the choice for advisors between brokerage and advisory and our ability to ensure that we can help them adequately do that as the rules change relative to Reg BI. And then again, if the DOL rule ultimately goes through and changes that slightly making sure that we're prepared to help them pivot where they can successfully continue to do that business where it's in the best interest of the clients. And I think hard to argue with making sure that you provide people choice and then ultimately enable those advisors to serve them and offering need to clients. That said, I do believe that in many cases, annuities will continue to be used where they're needed, where they make sense as a rollover option or where they make sense in helping someone as we talked about earlier, with downside protection, it's still participating in the upside for the equity markets, there's good places to use them. I think that -- what we will see though is in other areas, you'll probably see a bigger shift to the utilization of advisory. It's just tougher to do brokerage business. There may be some places, small accounts, there may be other scenarios where given the two options, the advisor ultimately utilize the advisory solution. We're still in the best interest of the client, but also just in the spirit of making sure the business can be done in a better and efficient way. So we do believe that's a trend. Hence, the investments in our advisory platforms, vertical integration we have around our advisor offering, again, lines up well with structural change as well. So put a capstone on it. We will and make sure that we're positioned to enable brokers to continue to be used. I do think that the DOL rule would create some headwind on the percentage of brokerage business that we see. -- but it won't be a complete change. You'll still see it utilized for some current rate. Yes. No, our sense of it is, look, we got to make sure we execute on our strategy. We've got to invest in our capabilities, and we've got to deliver attempt to deliver an extraordinary experience on a daily basis. We have solid trends there, strengthening NPS scores, evolving capability. We expect that retention rate in that 98.5% range to 99% range to be a good way to think about our good centering point, if you will, on retention for this year outside of the example of what Matt used, where someone sells the practice to potentially solve for succession solution. And look, that was the trigger that we launched our liquidity and succession program a year ago, gave us a great opportunity to go solve that really important question that many advisors had. Those two examples, maybe we didn't launch ours and time enough to get a swing at those. And though we won't win them all, we do believe we've got a really appealing differentiated solution that will position us well, not only to help serve our clients that are already on our platform, but actually use it as a way to attract new assets to the platform because not only do we have a rich value proposition that we serve and support the daily needs, we also can help them with their succession. So that's how we're [indiscernible]. Yes, yes, good questions. Look, I do think you've got a number of different things that might create a slight headwind on movement than at the aggregate had brought it down from I don't know, historically, 7% kind of range for movement. And we would expect things to return and normalize over a period of time. These little headwinds that I referenced, some of it is still a bit of a hangover from COVID and just some of the change in complexity that was created as people work through that, I think, is one. I think a second one is you just got -- you've had a volatile market with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty that surrounds it and advisors avoid sometimes making big strategic moves or pivots or adjustments in periods of time where they've really got to be focused on the clients, and they don't want to create more change in the midst of uncertainty. And I think that's been something that we've seen over the last couple of years that have created some uncertainty. And I also think you see advisors also pivoting in a new world of how do they operate post pandemic? What they learned from that? What pressures does it put on their practices; the growing complexity of regulations may drive up costs? The whole digitalization of their businesses and their offices and what does that mean? And how do they think about what is the best partner for them going forward? What are the types of services that are new to them to transform their practice? I think just trying to assess what those options and alternatives are in a world that's flipped on the side. And now you throw AI on top of that, which in the short run, creates lots of noise and exuberance. Unfortunately, it's also a shiny penny that sometimes doesn't always lead to good productive outcomes. And so I think as we get further down the road of assimilating some order to the house being flipped on its side in some cases and helping them really see where they can use technology really wisely to drive productivity with again, either leverage tools or outsource risk management to lower their costs associated with a world that's getting tougher and tougher from a regulatory standpoint, where they really do think about, hey, how do I drive growth? And what do I need in my value proposition to do that? How do I leverage folks to do? I think those are some of the interesting questions that is they're able to solve those. It enables them to move forward in a little more informed way and thus at a faster pace. So those are some of the little, I think, skirmishes, if you will, that we're trying -- we're overcoming as we go forward in time. It will help return maybe movement back to a more normal 7%. I'll take the first one, Matt. So, look, on the first one, I think we see an interesting pipeline on both sides of that enterprise channel. As I said before, banks and on the insurance/product manufacturer related market space. And with that portfolio, comes the continued opportunity, right, to continue to explore and learn, both how we're doing with existing programs and how that drives innovation to create more appeal in them. Second is every time you bring one on, how do you create a more automated and have a better playbook to be more efficient at doing that, so you can do that better and faster and more economically for the lower cost. And, so I would tell you we're much better than we were three years ago when we brought our first larger enterprises on and we continue to automate more and more of that kind of change management onboarding effort process. And as you rightfully said, to the success that you're able to do that, not only are you going to create more interesting economic outcomes by lowering the amount of investment upfront in these opportunities, you also can bring them on at a faster pace. And so I think we're working our way into being able to be very thoughtful about how we bring these on in an orderly fashion assuring that first and foremost we get the experience right, that you continue to operate your existing platform at the level that you want to. And then if you're, as you, again, get better and better at that, I think you can line those up and bring those in a faster and faster pace. And that's what we're challenging ourselves to do without being overly precise in exactly how that would look or what that looks like. I think we get, again, to challenge ourselves with pragmatic opportunities to think, how do you shorten that onboarding and change management effort? So that's the problem you can solve. Matt, do you want to get? Yes. And I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Tanya, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance, on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remained focused on our mission: of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This quarter we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges, and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I\u2019ll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets remained at $1.2 trillion, as continued solid organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Third quarter organic net new assets were $33 billion, representing 11% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $97 billion, representing approximately a 9% growth rate. In the quarter, Recruited Assets were $31 billion, including $12 billion from Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. Prior to large enterprises, Q3 represents a quarterly record for recruiting. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model, as well as our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same store sales, our advisors remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients, and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination that drove solid same store sales in Q3. With respect to Retention, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, Asset Retention for the third quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.74 of adjusted EPS, an increase of 19% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now, as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace, which, for us, means being the best at empowering advisors and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around two primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate with us, and vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of advisor needs. Now with that as context, let\u2019s start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisors and enterprises where they are in the evolution of their businesses by creating flexibility in our affiliation models such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable markets. Now, over the third quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, adding approximately $13 billion in assets. And as a result of the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee, and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter-to-date, recruiting roughly $5 billion in assets in Q3. Subsequent to launching these models a few years ago, we have continued to enhance their capabilities and thus further differentiate their value. Add to that the growing awareness of these models in the marketplace and that combination is creating more demand from prospective advisors. As a result, we expect to see a sustained increase in growth within our new affiliation models. Next, the traditional banking credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in Q3. During the quarter, we also continue to make progress with large enterprises, onboarding Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. The early feedback from these transitions has been positive as we continue to apply the learnings from previous onboardings to further enhance the experience. Looking ahead, we are confident that our industry-leading onboarding experience match with the expanding appeal of our model positions us well as a compelling alternative in this part of the market. In Q3, we also announced that Prudential Financial would onboard its retail wealth management business to our enterprise platform in the second half of 2024. This milestone reinforces the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises and reflects our commitment to help solve the unique and complex needs of a broad spectrum of institutions. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum and strong pipelines across the enterprise market. Now, within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on delivering a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services, and technology that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. Now, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress across several key fronts on this part of our strategy, including continuing the journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. This work includes evolving and enhancing our advisory platforms through simplified and lowered pricing, enhanced trading capabilities, value-added services like tax management, and the expanded investment choice and flexibility within our UMA platform. These efforts will help our advisors continue to provide more value for the clients in a differentiated and more personalized way. Now, as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of solid demand in Q3, the number of advisors utilizing our Services Group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,700 active users, up 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, a recent innovation in this portfolio is our Liquidity & Succession solution, which is resonating with existing LPL advisors, where to date, we have deployed approximately $275 million of capital and closed 20 deals. With the benefit of our learnings and insights, we recently began offering this solution to advisors that are external to LPL and are encouraged to see the early interest building. Finally, this service is also enriching the appeal of our model and by doing so, providing another differentiated solution to support our advisor recruiting efforts. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to make progress with our Liquidity & Succession solution. In addition, we onboarded Bank of the West and Commerce Bank and are preparing to onboard the wealth management business of Prudential. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, unchanged from Q2, as continued organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $33 billion, or approximately an 11% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $31 billion, which included $12 billion from Bank of the West and Commerce. Prior to these large enterprises, this was a quarterly record for overall recruiting, as well as for our new affiliation models, which contributed $5 billion in the quarter. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.74; gross profit was $1.10 billion up $20 million, or 2% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $219 million, up $1 million from Q2. In Q3, our payout rate was 87.3%, up 60 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding of Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4, so we anticipate our payout rate will be approximately 88%. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $378 million, down $18 million from Q2 as cash balances declined $3 billion to $47 billion. This marked the smallest quarterly decline we've seen this year. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65% within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 318 basis points in the quarter, down four basis points from Q2 driven by a decline in floating rate balances. As for Q4, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by roughly five basis points due to the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service and fee revenue, it was $136 million in Q3, up $13 million from Q2, primarily driven by revenues from our National Advisor Conference and IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large advisor conferences and expect seasonally lower IRA fees. Given this, we anticipate service and fee revenue will decline by roughly $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction revenue. It was $50 million, up $3 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in trading activity in October. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple million sequentially. Now let's turn to our strategic relationship with Prudential. In August, we announced that Prudential will onboard its retail wealth management business onto our platform, including their roughly 2,600 advisors serving approximately $50 billion of client assets. The investments we are making in connection with this relationship would not only help us serve Prudential and their advisors, but also improve the experience for our existing advisors and help unlock a broader opportunity to serve enterprises. With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Prudential, we continue to estimate a run rate EBITDA benefit for approximately $60 million once they're onboard. Looking ahead, we'll continue to provide updates in the progress we're making as we prepare to onboard Prudential. With that said, in terms of the cost transition, we continue to estimate total onboarding and integration costs of roughly $125 million with approximately $20 million expected in Q4. Now, let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $342 million in Q3, up $5 million from Q2. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $5 million. As a result, we now expect 2023 core G&A to be in a range of $1,350 million to $1,307 million. Moving on to Q3 promotional expense. It was $140 million up $33 million sequentially as we hosted our largest advisor conference of the year during the quarter. We also incurred roughly $6 million of Prudential related promotional expense in Q3. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect conference spend to decline by approximately $20 million. At the same time, we'll be ramping preparation for Prudential and expect related onboarding and integration costs to increase by roughly $15 million from Q3. So overall, we expect Q4 promotional expense to be flat to down $5 million sequentially. Turning to depreciation on amortization. It was $65 million in Q3, up $7 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $48 million in Q3, up $3 million sequentially, driven by the impact of higher short-term interest rates on our floating rate debt and increased usage of our revolver. Looking ahead to Q4, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $1 million from Q3. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q3 with corporate cash of $309 million down $16 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio is 1.3 times up slightly from Q2. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital across our entire framework. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution, and return capital to our shareholders repurchasing $250 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute on our $2 billion authorization over two years. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be coming from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt.\nDan Arnold: Good afternoon.\nSteven Chubak: So, I wanted to start off with a question just on the organic growth outlook. The 11% NNA figure came in at the higher end of the 7% to 13% range you guys have talked about in the past. I would say what really stood out was the strong result relative to the slowdown in NNA that we saw at some of your peers. I was hoping you could unpack what were the biggest contributors to the share gains in the quarter? And with the recruited assets tracking up 40%, how confident are you that this level of organic growth can, in fact, be sustained?\nDan Arnold: Steven, it's Dan. Let me take that. And certainly, we can build off of that answer. So, look, I think in the short-term, we've got a jumping off point that, as you said, is in the solid place of 11% growth for the quarter. And probably just as importantly, we saw a diverse contribution across all of our advisor and enterprise models, which I think speaks to not only the volume of growth, but the breadth and diversity of the sources of growth. And I think if I highlighted a couple of things inside Q3 that maybe are significant to that overall outcome, the first would be we continue to see low levels of attrition in that 1% to 1.5% zone. That's certainly a solid outcome and reinforces the appeal and the execution quality of the operation day to day. And I think it's complemented by the solid performance in new store sales where we recruited $31 billion of assets for the quarter. And if you click down on that $31 billion of assets, I think if you look at that prior to large enterprises, right, Q3 has quarterly high recruiting of $19 billion in assets, which is more than double a year ago. And I think when you take out or back out some of the lumpier nature of some of the large enterprise recruiting you put down underneath that, again, you see the diversity of that growth in new store sales, as well as it happening across all of our different advisor-oriented models. And you feel pretty good about the sustainability of that opportunity set. And so look, the drivers of that, right, the flexibility of the affiliation model gives us and puts us in a position of competing for potentially any advisor that's looking for a newer, better home. It's continued expansion of our capabilities to help us differentiate our model. And then you continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding to make it easier and easier to move and take friction out. We believe we do those things well, and it creates a key contributor to our overall growth and a good, solid, sustainable growth rate as we go forward. So I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: Yes, it's a really helpful color, Dan. And for my follow-up for Matt, surprise, surprise, a question on client cash. 3Q cash levels were down 5%, admittedly more resilient than the sweep deposit decline that we saw of roughly 7% to 10% at peers. So that being said, cash outflows did continue in September. How are client cash balances trending so far in October? And are you anticipating any seasonal benefit to 4Q cash levels from tax loss harvesting?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Steven. So I think on just \u2013 and maybe to answer the last part of your question first, I think if history is a guy, you typically do see some seasonal build-in at the end of the fourth quarter, typically in December for some cash or tax loss harvesting. So I'd be surprised if we did not see that this year. It's pretty common. I think on the core of your question, when we look at how things are going in October, I'd say that the headline is on the cash sweep side as we continue to see some of the stability that we started to see in the third quarter and specifically a reminder that advisory fees primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, and that's for October it would be a little over $1.1 billion, which is going to immediately bring down cash, but cash flows outside of that have been relatively flat here almost at the end of the month. So that would put cash sweep at around $46.2 billion is really those advisory fees coming out. And from a percent of AUM would put it right at 3.8% of AUM, which would be the fourth month in a row that we were at that level. So I think when we look at those trends, and I think as we've talked a bit about before, we're starting to get to a place where you've got a natural amount of cash necessary to really manage the account. And of course, it could go down further from here, but I think you're starting to see those resistance levels that we talked about before in those balances. Now, some of the other drivers there, maybe just to speak to how organic growth is going, because a lot of that drives and brings in cash as well, when we look at what we've seen in October, is really continuing some of those positive trends that Dan was just talking about in Q3. And keeping in mind that the seasonal nature of the first month as well on organic growth with those advisory fees come out as well, when you look at what we've seen so far for October, prior to any additional assets coming on board from Bank of the West, Commerce, organic growth is running in the 6% zone. That compares to 4% prior to large enterprises in October of last year. So we're continuing to see that strength there. And then there is about $1.5 billion of AUM left to come on board from those two institutions, and some of that may come in, in October, so that would bias it up from there. So overall, I think, I'd summarize October as stability starting to show in cash sweep and organic growth continuing to come in at solid levels.\nSteven Chubak: That's a great color, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, all. This is Luke on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. If we could start with Prudential. We've seen LPL expand into new channels a number of times, with the insurance channel being the newest one, with the Pru partnership. Can you just talk through how you expect this opportunity to expand over time? And how you think about the TAM? And then could you also refresh us on the P&L dynamics and the timing you're thinking through there? Thanks.\nDan Arnold: Let me start with answering that, and then Matt will come in and answer maybe the second part of that. And so look at the headline level, if you take a step back and just look at the large enterprise opportunity set with respect to the bank space as you know we onboarded two new large enterprises this quarter, and we continue to see a opportunity set in that large enterprise space of those that continue to act as their own broker dealers and RIAs and do the business in-house and see an interesting TAM that would consider a different strategic approach. And so I think those wins reinforced that value proposition. Our continued investment in this and our experience in managing and working with these large enterprises did certainly help us as we go forward in that part of the large enterprise space. And as you said the announcement of the Pru win kind of opens up a different part of large enterprises, in this case perhaps insurance-owned solution sets and/or part of the market space. And look, for there, we think \u2013 again we take that similar chassis. We're building some personalized and interesting customized solutions for Prudential that we think will resonate with other solutions in that part of the space. They've got similar needs from a value proposition standpoint when you think about the improvement driving efficiencies within their models, shifting their risk profiles, enhancing economics, and even working to stimulate top-line growth, all things that I think similar large enterprises are looking to do. These are things that we're working on collectively with banks and ultimately with Prudential. So we think there is a relevant opportunity. We think Prudential opportunity is a catalyst to open up more discussions in that part of the space. So we think, again, that the broader enterprise, large enterprise market is an interesting continued durable growth opportunity for us, both on the bank side and on the broader insurance, if that helps.\nMatt Audette: Yes. And then just following up on the financial dynamics and reminders, there are about $50 billion of client assets. We would expect to onboard them in the latter part of 2024. And that's when our estimated run rate EBITDA of $60 million would start, when they're fully onboarded. Between now and then is really the onboarding and integration costs that estimate overall of $125 million. And if you look at what we've done so far in the third quarter in our guide for the fourth quarter, that puts broadly $25 million of that in 2023, meaning the remaining $100 million would come through in 2024. And then once they're onboarded, again, would be back to that $60 million EBITDA run rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Super helpful. Thanks for walking through everything there. Switching topics a bit for the follow-up, this quarter saw an acceleration of service and fee revenues up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Can you just talk through what drove that? And how do you think about revenue opportunities for existing services? And then related to that, you recently expanded access for your outsourced CFO services. What are high-level expectations there for both FA uptake and revenue opportunities? Thanks again.\nMatt Audette: Yes, I'll take the first part of that. And then, Dan, if you want to jump in on the CFO solutions, which I know is your favorite solution, this is mine as well. I think so in service and fees, I'd say there's just two primary drivers. I think the first is just seasonal factors that come through in the third quarter. We've had our larger \u2013 our National Advisor Conference in the third quarter, and there is revenues and fees that come along with that for the product sponsors that are there. And then second, the third quarter is a seasonally high quarter for IRA fees. So those two things came through. But then second, I think maybe the \u2013 from a longer-term standpoint, is really organic growth of the business. And we've got fees associated with that are specific to advisors on our platform. So as we continue to grow the number of advisors we serve and support, you've got a recurring fees and things that come along with that and those show up here as well. So those are the two broad drivers. So I think when you look ahead to Q4, that's why we expect that the decline of $10 million is really that seasonality coming \u2013 the seasonal factor is coming out, but I think the core from a long-term standpoint is the more we drive organic growth, the more we serve and support advisors on our platform, this section or this item will continue to grow. Now, it also includes the fees related to our services portfolio. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the CFO solutions.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Thanks, Matt. And so look, if you think about our services portfolio, just start with a broader context, and then we'll put down your specific question. Initially, when we rolled out these solutions or this services portfolio, the initial bundle of services were really more relevant for our larger practices. If you didn't have a complex practice, let's use it as an example, our initial rollout of CFO solutions, then that solution may not be relevant to you, or it may be at a price point that makes it out of reach for you. And so learning through that sort of first iteration around of innovation, we realized that a lot of the capabilities within the original CFO solutions were needed for all advisors to figure out how to package those in a different way at a lower price point and still create that leverage point of value for our advisors, then that would be a good problem to solve for and one that would create real value for our advisors. And so that's what you saw with this new rollout of what we call CFO Essentials that \u2013 again it will reach a much broader set of our 22,000-plus advisors or be much more applicable to them, and we think meet their needs at a price point that makes sense and continue then to drive the utilization and growth of that overall kind of suite of CFO-type solutions. We're doing that on the marketing side as well. So these are just, I think, places where we continue to innovate on that overall portfolio. For the fine point on that, we now have 13 solutions in our overall services portfolio, of which many of them are relevant across or could be relevant across our entire advisor base. We've got three more solutions that we will roll out in the near to intermediate term and another handful in incubation. So it continues to be a place of innovation for us, and we think there is still a good bit of opportunity to continue to help build leverage points for advisors in the spirit of helping them run thriving businesses. So that's kind of the context around CFO Essentials.\nOperator: Okay. And one moment for our next question will be coming from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open Devin.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Hi, Dan. Hi, Matt. I would love to just maybe start on the RIA channel. Really nice momentum, particularly on net new assets there in the quarter and, I guess, particularly in the corporate RIA. So I'd love to just maybe dig a little bit into the drivers this quarter and then just the outlook, and also whether the Schwab-Ameritrade conversion was a factor this quarter or even just going forward as you kind of consolidate some of the large players there just want to think about kind of some of the incremental opportunity for LPL.\nDan Arnold: Yes, Devin, so this is Dan. Let me try to cover those sort of different points that you're exploring. I think first and foremost, if you look at overall just advisory growth in general, right, you continue to see success and progress we have in both same-store sales and new-store sales across, again, all of our different types of affiliation models. So that would cover your corporate RIA, your hybrid RIA solutions, your pure RIA solutions. And I think we still see about $0.75 of every new dollar invested go into advisory. So that's where you're going to pick up the contribution from same-store sales. And you still see conversions or transitions from brokerage to advisory services. Those are your tailwinds that are overall driving that advisory growth. I think if you pull back then and look at the different affiliation models and how we're positioned in the marketplace, certainly the diversity of our different models continues to help us attract a diverse set of advisors and advisors that, quite frankly, do more and more advisory when they join LPL. And you're seeing that in the traditional space as we continue to attract more and more larger advisors with more complex practices. If you look across our different new affiliation models, right, employee strategic wealth and pure RIA, a lot of those will be breakaways from wires that will come with significant advisory books. And if you just click down on those new affiliation models, as we said, this would have represented a record in terms of recruiting $5 billion of assets. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've actually recruited $14 billion in new assets to those affiliation models, which is 50% of what we've overall recruited since they've been launched. And certainly that mix of business that tends to have more significant percentages of their books and advisory is, again, another driver. And I think as we continue to have success with those models, as we continue to invest in them, they become more and more appealing, there is more and more awareness of them, and thus more demand. We certainly are well positioned to see that advisory business flow. I think specifically relative to maybe your question around Schwab and Ameritrade, it's probably more the pure RIA business, and we do see that as a continued interesting place, of which to compete and try to win. So we continue to invest in our solution and our model to ensure that we create a differentiated solution that will help us be positioned to win and capitalize on whether it be market share opportunity that's created by consolidation or just ongoing demand for that type of solution. And I think as we try to position ourselves as a more vertically integrated strategic partner that creates more value for the adviser, we think that positions us well to participate and win an outsized share of market as we move forward in this space.\nDevin Ryan: All right, thanks Dan. Follow-up here just for Matt. Thinking about kind of the ICA yield glide path maybe beyond 4Q, so you have $6.5 billion of contracts maturing next year. We're just modeling kind of \u2013 those kind of rolling off ratably. But is there any sense of, as we get closer there, just more color on the cadence, what that could look like. And then as we think about also the base rate on ICA and even on the floating book today, how much improvement are you seeing? It seems like, and we're hearing that there's more demand in the bank system. And so just kind of what the uplift might look like there? Thank you.\nMatt Audette: Yes, Devin. On the fixed rate side, I think the \u2013 of that $6.5 billion, about $0.5 billion rolls off in the first quarter and then the rest of it is evenly throughout the year. So about $2 billion a quarter. And I think our plans would be to reinvest that in new fixed rate contracts, the same way we have been in that three- to five-year zone. And I think when you look at the rates in that environment the demand here is just as strong as it is on the floating rate side. So, to your point on kind of spreads above the base rate, so if you look at where the curve is for a three- to five-year money at this point, you're in the 450 to 470 range, but we're starting to see with the demand for deposit spreads on the fixed rate side as well. So you can think maybe more closer to or up to 500 basis points for those contracts when they're rolling off on average at 250. So rounding up, I'd say, an opportunity to kind of double the earnings on those balances as they mature. On the floating rate side, I think, we've seen spreads in the 15 to 30 basis point range, which I'd say is historically high. But we've probably seen that for the last couple of quarters. So you're starting to see that flow through on the floating rate side. But a broad point, you can just see in the pricing, if you are a supplier of deposits, the demand is there and the pricing is quite good.\nDevin Ryan: Yes, got it. Okay, I leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Ben Budish of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBen Budish: Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for the taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on Ameritrade. We've seen some kind of media press indicating that there may be a pickup in sort of outbound to alternative custodians and other kind of services providers. I am not sure if that's something you can comment on, but would great if you could. But even if not, maybe another sort of question along the same lines is if that were the case and you were seeing a pickup post Labor Day, how long does it typically take for an adviser who is showing interest to convert if you're successful there?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So for us, I think I'd answer that more broadly that we see all registered advisers as an opportunity to potentially affiliate with one of our models, and we obviously invest in a significant business development team that\u2019s out in the marketplace, exploring those opportunities. I think we continue to create real structural value that creates demand and appeal across our model, it's first and foremost, the opportunity. But if you're doing that well, and you have the efficacy of a good business development team you will then when market opportunities may arise in the short run, and we challenge ourselves to be agile and nimble to be able to capitalize on those regardless of what they may be and when they may occur. And so that's the combination that we think about how we go to market, right? You create good structural differentiation and value, you have a great team that can go tell that story and then you're agile and nimble when opportunities come up that may be created for whatever reason. So look, when there's transitions that occur in the marketplace, just in general back to your other question, there's generally opportunity that may occur around the transition of assets from one custodian to another or one broker-dealer from another. And depending on the complexity that may occur in that transition, typically, then there's some opportunity that may arise post that, whether that be because of new environment, service challenges, new technology, whatever the case may be change management challenges that may occur, that may create some unrest. And that may create some opportunity. And again, I think we try to be well positioned and well prepared to capitalize pre-conversions, post-conversions when those may occur and where that opportunity may occur. I hope that helps.\nBen Budish: Yes, understood. Maybe one just quick follow-up just on corporate cash for the last few quarters been running ahead of your target level. Just to what degree is that maybe conservatism or just a matter of timing for the end for the quarter? Or is that more intentional? Any color you could share there would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Audette: Yes, you bet. Short answer is timing, right? I think when you look at our overall liquidity it's more about managing our overall leverage ratio. I think the corporate cash balances end up being a little bit of timing, simple as that.\nBen Budish: All right, appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nMatt Audette: Welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on NNA and the outlook. And just what the backlog looks like today maybe versus last quarter or a year ago, and we've heard about more industry churn or churn for advisers picking up. And would you echo that? And what does that mean for potential acceleration in terms of that adviser adds over the next kind of six, twelve months?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So look, I think the headline, as we said earlier, from a recruiting standpoint is we continue to see that as a solid lever and driver of growth or contributor to growth both in the short run and longer term. So if I just put a little color on that for you, when we look out at the environment explore how we position ourselves to win we typically start with the opportunity set where you went to advisor movement. I would actually reflect it as more flat over the last year, it's somewhere around 5.5% movement or turnover. We haven't seen a big move up from that, but it's more sustained and we call it that range down for now. What has happened is there has been a bit of a mix shift in some of the movement or turnover where we've seen the movement amongst the independent market picked up where some of the movement has slowed down from the wires as an example. That said, given all of that look, I think, what we do is challenge ourselves into how do you succeed regardless of the volume of movement. And I think we continue to see our win rates improve despite the lower level of movement. And with the diversification of our models, right, that mix shift that I spoke to is more of a neutral point for us as, again, we try to compete competitively [ph] for all 300,000 advisers that may move. So the overall churn we've overcome those lower levels of churn. We do think that they will come back over time. There is lots of reason to believe that that number begins to pick up and more trend back towards the norm. And so if we can sustain higher win rates because we've got a more appealing model, we've gotten better at recruiting matched with the flexibility of our model, I think, we think that positions us well as we go forward. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, again, we haven't seen significant changes or material changes across the playing field there. That said, what we talked about in the last question, there are moments in time in the marketplace where there may be some elevated movement because an organization is going through some strategic transition. And we always try to position ourselves there to get a bit of an over index gain on those opportunities when they may occur. I think if you add all of that up and you look out over the intermediate term, if you look at our growing pipeline, the growing sort of appeal of our different affiliation models, the strength of our adviser recruiting matched with the nice complement of bigger mandates in the enterprise marketplace. And we feel good about our short and intermediate opportunity for recruiting. And then longer term, I think, we go back to our structural advantages and really back to our strategy where we continue to see a growing appeal and demand for advice, the attractiveness of the adviser or the independent model matched with the desire to receive that model from a financial professional. The overall demand for advice continues to give us a big tailwind. You take our market leadership in the independent model singular focused on really understanding and innovating in it, robust feature platform we have to jump off from in our capacity and commitment to invest back into the model. And we think that certainly positions us long term to capitalize on current large demand that exists today, but the growing demand for advice is going to create more opportunity going forward and our ability to differentiate. Hope that helps.\nDan Fannon: Yes, that's helpful. And I guess, Matt, just a follow-up here on expenses. So first is the promo expense missed the guidance for the third quarter. So curious about what drove that. And then as we think about G&A, I know there\u2019s elevated spend because of the environment and the solid organic growth. If we \u2013 in looking at Slide 24, it\u2019s obviously been on a trajectory higher for several years. If we think about longer term, not so much for just 2024, what is a reasonable growth rate do you think for G&A spend to maintain that these solid levels of organic growth?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think just, I\u2019ll hit the promo first. I think when you look at our guide for Q3, which was in the 130 to 135 range, we came in at 140. Really just a factor of the timing of the large enterprise onboarding expenses. We had both Bank of the West and Commerce come on board in the quarter. That\u2019s the quarter where those expenses are typically the highest. And then we started the integration onboarding work for Prudential, which we\u2019ve got an overall estimate of $125 million and that is still our estimate just ramped up a little bit faster. So it\u2019s simply the timing of expenses associated with those I think [indiscernible] highlight for Q3. I think to your second question on overall core G&A growth, I mean I think we plan those investments and spend in each and every year with a focus on making sure we\u2019re investing to drive and support organic growth. Making sure we\u2019re balancing that with delivering operating leverage. And then I think perhaps to the core of your question, adjusting those levels based on the macro environment. And I think that\u2019s where we get to what we\u2019re doing this year is having an up level of investment and spend that I think really helps improve our value proposition, our capabilities to our advisors and is one of the drivers of our success in organic growth. And I think when we think about that over the long term, the things like that would be dependent upon the environment, right? So if you remember from the guidance of 13% to 15% growth this year, about 4% to 5% of that was really based on the opportunity of the environment. So I think when you\u2019re thinking long term, I think that\u2019s a bucket where you can put aside and say we\u2019d just be opportunistic at for that amount if the environment was there. And I think when we get back to what we\u2019re spending on and what we\u2019re doing this year, we think it\u2019s been a quite the right decision and a good use of capital.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Michael?\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe just continuing with expense related questions just on the promotional expense, we\u2019ve seen an uptake in recent years. Understand there\u2019s been some investments made to support that. Just as we look out over the next couple years, how should we think about sort of an underlying true run rate of expense growth for on the promotional side in order to maintain the organic growth that you guys are looking to achieve? And I think on the promotional side, you also called that about a 100 million of onboarding for next year. Should we think about that all fully coming out in 2025?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Well, I think when you look at the drivers, it\u2019s really three things. And I think on that last point, it on the 100 million for potential it related to large financial institutions and those institutions coming on board. So I think the \u2013 we think about our opportunity set, I think we would expect to have those be an ongoing opportunity. But to the core of your question, if there weren\u2019t any in a year or there weren\u2019t any large financial institutions coming on board those expenses would go away. That 100 million is specific to Prudential. Meaning once that\u2019s onboarded, unless there\u2019s others coming on board you wouldn\u2019t have a spend level of that amount. But the other and the key drivers though of the growth overall outside of the number of large financial institutions or enterprises we have, are coming on board is really organic growth, right? And I think when you look at the amount of organic growth that we have the transition assistance associated with that and the amortization of that, that\u2019s primarily what shows up in the growth for promotional. And it\u2019s about the size of our recruiting. I think we\u2019ve talked about it a bunch on this call and during this Q&A. But the amount of recruited AUM that we\u2019re bringing on board is increased substantially in the capital that helps bring that on board and the expense shows up here. The other one I\u2019d highlight to a much smaller extent is just conference spend, right? That\u2019s based on the number of advisors we have at the firm. The bigger we get, the more value there is in engaging with more of those folks in person at our conferences that would naturally rise. But I think the two key things are number of large financial institutions coming on board and then just the level and amount of our organic growth. Those would be the two big drivers.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question on D&A, I think you had called out about $200 million of platform investments to be capitalized. I mentioned that\u2019s going to come through the D&A line, just how do we think about the timeframe and cadence for that to come through?\nDan Arnold: Yes. And that\u2019s associated with Prudential as well. So if you think about Prudential overall of $325 million of investment and reminder, there\u2019s no transition assistance that comes along with it. That\u2019s the total investment. So that the timing will be like typical to a large financial institution. It will be mostly leading up to and during the quarter of onboarding, but there can also be some that comes across after that. And then you get into, based on the technology that we\u2019re putting in place, which are typically amortization periods called in the four or five year zone once they\u2019re deployed.\nMichael Cyprys: So we think about that $200 million coming through over five years or so roughly, is that fair?\nDan Arnold: Yes, yes. One once it\u2019s deployed, four or five years following this, I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Kyle, your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. So maybe just one on the regulatory environment. It sounds like the DOL is set to propose a new fiduciary rule very shortly. Obviously, you don\u2019t have any many details at this point. But just wondering if you could comment high level on the state of the business today relative to 2016 or minus of some of the more meaningful changes that were already implemented ahead of the prior DOL rule that was ultimately vacated. And would be great to kind of hear how you feel about potential expense needs to comply with any new rule proposal given the investments that were already made to comply with the prior rule?\nDan Arnold: Okay. So let me take that one in. And so look, there is a DOL proposal that\u2019s under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and that\u2019s the procedural step as you know, before the proposals released to the public comments. So there\u2019s not a lot of insight on what\u2019s contained inside of that. I think there\u2019s been a lot of speculative dialogue about what that may be. But I think we\u2019ll learn more as you know, we move to the next step. I think what we do believe is that once it moves to public comment, it\u2019s a long process of which to work through ultimately either some proposed change that may occur from that and or not. And so I think you\u2019ll see a good public dialogue about what\u2019s being considered. That said, I think we did, as you said, did significant work back in 2016 and had some cool innovation even around some products like mutual funds as an example that didn\u2019t ultimately wasn\u2019t ultimately utilized as we \u2013 as the 2016 fiduciary rule was struck down and ultimately pivoted to the Regulation Best Interest, what is different. And I think and by the way, that will serve as a great baseline, a lot of the innovative work that we did, some we use today in Reg BI, some we\u2019re not using, and we think it prepares us well of which to ultimately pivot and or adjust for whatever changes may occur in the rule. I do think that the dialogue around the rule itself is a bit different in context. The circumstances are different than as you know Reg BI has just really been released out into the marketplace for a couple of years. And we do think it is a, it proposes a higher standard of care, which we are aligned with and we think the SEC is the right regulator to create that rule across all parts of business, both retirement and non-retirement. And consequently we think that because of that rule is in place, the consideration set for that and allowing that to run its course and ensure that it\u2019s effective in ultimately establishing and aligning around that higher standard of care. We think has a lot of relevance in the dialogue that will occur. And if you go back to some of the proposals in 2016, I think there is the big risk that ultimately you take away choice and that begins to harm low and middle income investors by limiting access to brokerage advice for those smaller retirement accounts, which obviously in systemically it\u2019s not a good outcome. It would be a big unintended influence, which I think you\u2019ll have a lot of pushback and a lot of relevant concern around that potential outcome. So we just believe the circumstances are different to have this sort of public debate and open the view around the process. All that said, if there are some changes incrementally we do think we\u2019re well prepared to pivot and add those and continue to deliver choice between both brokers and advisory. Always believe as principal choices of other option and we think it\u2019ll serve investors much, much better. So I hope that gives you a little color. The point is we don\u2019t really know yet. I think there is something that is being considered and we think it\u2019ll be a good healthy debate and we\u2019ll be well prepared.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up just on the liquidity in succession solutions, that you\u2019re now opening that externally. I guess is there any way to frame how meaningful that could be relative to the size of the capital deployed internally that you disclosed so far? And then second part of that question, and I know this topic comes up from time to time, but curious if you give us any updated thoughts on potentially offering your broader business solution suite externally?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So look, I think \u2013 let me take the strategic part of that and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to ask your capital or to address your capital question. So look, the liquidity and succession solution that we came up with was on the premise of solving a big need, right? A third of advisors potentially requiring over the next 10 years, certainly a relevant problem to solve. And the team did a great job of coming up with a differentiated creative solution that has ultimately been very appealing to existing LPL advisors that were facing that same problem and challenge. And I think because of its differentiated nature it made sense for us to take those learnings and insights and then go potentially offer that outside of our platform in doing that high probability to those assets. And if we offered it to the external marketplace, would then move to the LPL platform, that would be the concept as another way to motivate them to move to our platform. Because of the demand and the interest that we\u2019ve generated internally because of the learnings that we\u2019ve had just in the basically 45 days we\u2019ve been in market around it. We think it\u2019s going to have some interest and be broadly appealing to the outside marketplace. We\u2019ll learn more hard to size right now because we just don\u2019t have enough data to support that. But we do think it\u2019s appealing in another way to attract assets to the LPL platform and be a smart deployment of capital in order to do so. So that\u2019s kind of where we are now in that journey. More to come as we learn more. But at least that\u2019s how we think about it strategically. With respect to our other services that we may offer outside of the platform. I think we continue to have set that aside as a future possibility. We continue to see opportunity internally on with respect to our growing number of advisories on the LPL platform and innovating on new solutions and expanding that portfolio set versus broadening the distribution outside of the LPL platform. So think about that as our near-term focus, continue to add more services and in supporting our growing platform here. I do think it\u2019s a relevant question at some point to ask. Could you logically apply that outside of our advisory base, you want take that?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Kyle, I think that, I mean the headline is that we, I wouldn\u2019t see any different level of capital deployment taking it external other than to highlight when you\u2019re taking this external, you\u2019re really doing two events. There\u2019s a recruiting event as well as the LNS transaction of putting succession solution. So think about from a capital deployment standpoint, a good frame would be that knowing that those two things would be occurring. But I think the headline point is that nothing from a capital standpoint that would be different than we talked about before. These are relatively small amounts of capital deployment on an individual level. It\u2019s more about as Dan was covering the strategic connection and of this capability from an advisor standpoint and our long-term growth.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to make progress with our Liquidity & Succession solution. In addition, we onboarded Bank of the West and Commerce Bank and are preparing to onboard the wealth management business of Prudential. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, unchanged from Q2, as continued organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $33 billion, or approximately an 11% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $31 billion, which included $12 billion from Bank of the West and Commerce. Prior to these large enterprises, this was a quarterly record for overall recruiting, as well as for our new affiliation models, which contributed $5 billion in the quarter. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.74; gross profit was $1.10 billion up $20 million, or 2% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $219 million, up $1 million from Q2. In Q3, our payout rate was 87.3%, up 60 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding of Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4, so we anticipate our payout rate will be approximately 88%. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $378 million, down $18 million from Q2 as cash balances declined $3 billion to $47 billion. This marked the smallest quarterly decline we've seen this year. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65% within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 318 basis points in the quarter, down four basis points from Q2 driven by a decline in floating rate balances. As for Q4, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by roughly five basis points due to the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service and fee revenue, it was $136 million in Q3, up $13 million from Q2, primarily driven by revenues from our National Advisor Conference and IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large advisor conferences and expect seasonally lower IRA fees. Given this, we anticipate service and fee revenue will decline by roughly $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction revenue. It was $50 million, up $3 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in trading activity in October. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple million sequentially. Now let's turn to our strategic relationship with Prudential. In August, we announced that Prudential will onboard its retail wealth management business onto our platform, including their roughly 2,600 advisors serving approximately $50 billion of client assets. The investments we are making in connection with this relationship would not only help us serve Prudential and their advisors, but also improve the experience for our existing advisors and help unlock a broader opportunity to serve enterprises. With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Prudential, we continue to estimate a run rate EBITDA benefit for approximately $60 million once they're onboard. Looking ahead, we'll continue to provide updates in the progress we're making as we prepare to onboard Prudential. With that said, in terms of the cost transition, we continue to estimate total onboarding and integration costs of roughly $125 million with approximately $20 million expected in Q4. Now, let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $342 million in Q3, up $5 million from Q2. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $5 million. As a result, we now expect 2023 core G&A to be in a range of $1,350 million to $1,307 million. Moving on to Q3 promotional expense. It was $140 million up $33 million sequentially as we hosted our largest advisor conference of the year during the quarter. We also incurred roughly $6 million of Prudential related promotional expense in Q3. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect conference spend to decline by approximately $20 million. At the same time, we'll be ramping preparation for Prudential and expect related onboarding and integration costs to increase by roughly $15 million from Q3. So overall, we expect Q4 promotional expense to be flat to down $5 million sequentially. Turning to depreciation on amortization. It was $65 million in Q3, up $7 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $48 million in Q3, up $3 million sequentially, driven by the impact of higher short-term interest rates on our floating rate debt and increased usage of our revolver. Looking ahead to Q4, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $1 million from Q3. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q3 with corporate cash of $309 million down $16 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio is 1.3 times up slightly from Q2. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital across our entire framework. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution, and return capital to our shareholders repurchasing $250 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute on our $2 billion authorization over two years. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes, Steven. So I think on just \u2013 and maybe to answer the last part of your question first, I think if history is a guy, you typically do see some seasonal build-in at the end of the fourth quarter, typically in December for some cash or tax loss harvesting. So I'd be surprised if we did not see that this year. It's pretty common. I think on the core of your question, when we look at how things are going in October, I'd say that the headline is on the cash sweep side as we continue to see some of the stability that we started to see in the third quarter and specifically a reminder that advisory fees primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, and that's for October it would be a little over $1.1 billion, which is going to immediately bring down cash, but cash flows outside of that have been relatively flat here almost at the end of the month. So that would put cash sweep at around $46.2 billion is really those advisory fees coming out. And from a percent of AUM would put it right at 3.8% of AUM, which would be the fourth month in a row that we were at that level. So I think when we look at those trends, and I think as we've talked a bit about before, we're starting to get to a place where you've got a natural amount of cash necessary to really manage the account. And of course, it could go down further from here, but I think you're starting to see those resistance levels that we talked about before in those balances. Now, some of the other drivers there, maybe just to speak to how organic growth is going, because a lot of that drives and brings in cash as well, when we look at what we've seen in October, is really continuing some of those positive trends that Dan was just talking about in Q3. And keeping in mind that the seasonal nature of the first month as well on organic growth with those advisory fees come out as well, when you look at what we've seen so far for October, prior to any additional assets coming on board from Bank of the West, Commerce, organic growth is running in the 6% zone. That compares to 4% prior to large enterprises in October of last year. So we're continuing to see that strength there. And then there is about $1.5 billion of AUM left to come on board from those two institutions, and some of that may come in, in October, so that would bias it up from there. So overall, I think, I'd summarize October as stability starting to show in cash sweep and organic growth continuing to come in at solid levels. Yes. And then just following up on the financial dynamics and reminders, there are about $50 billion of client assets. We would expect to onboard them in the latter part of 2024. And that's when our estimated run rate EBITDA of $60 million would start, when they're fully onboarded. Between now and then is really the onboarding and integration costs that estimate overall of $125 million. And if you look at what we've done so far in the third quarter in our guide for the fourth quarter, that puts broadly $25 million of that in 2023, meaning the remaining $100 million would come through in 2024. And then once they're onboarded, again, would be back to that $60 million EBITDA run rate. Yes, I'll take the first part of that. And then, Dan, if you want to jump in on the CFO solutions, which I know is your favorite solution, this is mine as well. I think so in service and fees, I'd say there's just two primary drivers. I think the first is just seasonal factors that come through in the third quarter. We've had our larger \u2013 our National Advisor Conference in the third quarter, and there is revenues and fees that come along with that for the product sponsors that are there. And then second, the third quarter is a seasonally high quarter for IRA fees. So those two things came through. But then second, I think maybe the \u2013 from a longer-term standpoint, is really organic growth of the business. And we've got fees associated with that are specific to advisors on our platform. So as we continue to grow the number of advisors we serve and support, you've got a recurring fees and things that come along with that and those show up here as well. So those are the two broad drivers. So I think when you look ahead to Q4, that's why we expect that the decline of $10 million is really that seasonality coming \u2013 the seasonal factor is coming out, but I think the core from a long-term standpoint is the more we drive organic growth, the more we serve and support advisors on our platform, this section or this item will continue to grow. Now, it also includes the fees related to our services portfolio. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the CFO solutions. Yes, Devin. On the fixed rate side, I think the \u2013 of that $6.5 billion, about $0.5 billion rolls off in the first quarter and then the rest of it is evenly throughout the year. So about $2 billion a quarter. And I think our plans would be to reinvest that in new fixed rate contracts, the same way we have been in that three- to five-year zone. And I think when you look at the rates in that environment the demand here is just as strong as it is on the floating rate side. So, to your point on kind of spreads above the base rate, so if you look at where the curve is for a three- to five-year money at this point, you're in the 450 to 470 range, but we're starting to see with the demand for deposit spreads on the fixed rate side as well. So you can think maybe more closer to or up to 500 basis points for those contracts when they're rolling off on average at 250. So rounding up, I'd say, an opportunity to kind of double the earnings on those balances as they mature. On the floating rate side, I think, we've seen spreads in the 15 to 30 basis point range, which I'd say is historically high. But we've probably seen that for the last couple of quarters. So you're starting to see that flow through on the floating rate side. But a broad point, you can just see in the pricing, if you are a supplier of deposits, the demand is there and the pricing is quite good. Yes, you bet. Short answer is timing, right? I think when you look at our overall liquidity it's more about managing our overall leverage ratio. I think the corporate cash balances end up being a little bit of timing, simple as that. Welcome. Yes. I think just, I'll hit the promo first. I think when you look at our guide for Q3, which was in the 130 to 135 range, we came in at 140. Really just a factor of the timing of the large enterprise onboarding expenses. We had both Bank of the West and Commerce come on board in the quarter. That's the quarter where those expenses are typically the highest. And then we started the integration onboarding work for Prudential, which we've got an overall estimate of $125 million and that is still our estimate just ramped up a little bit faster. So it's simply the timing of expenses associated with those I think [indiscernible] highlight for Q3. I think to your second question on overall core G&A growth, I mean I think we plan those investments and spend in each and every year with a focus on making sure we're investing to drive and support organic growth. Making sure we're balancing that with delivering operating leverage. And then I think perhaps to the core of your question, adjusting those levels based on the macro environment. And I think that's where we get to what we're doing this year is having an up level of investment and spend that I think really helps improve our value proposition, our capabilities to our advisors and is one of the drivers of our success in organic growth. And I think when we think about that over the long term, the things like that would be dependent upon the environment, right? So if you remember from the guidance of 13% to 15% growth this year, about 4% to 5% of that was really based on the opportunity of the environment. So I think when you're thinking long term, I think that's a bucket where you can put aside and say we'd just be opportunistic at for that amount if the environment was there. And I think when we get back to what we're spending on and what we're doing this year, we think it's been a quite the right decision and a good use of capital. Yes, Kyle, I think that, I mean the headline is that we, I wouldn't see any different level of capital deployment taking it external other than to highlight when you're taking this external, you're really doing two events. There's a recruiting event as well as the LNS transaction of putting succession solution. So think about from a capital deployment standpoint, a good frame would be that knowing that those two things would be occurring. But I think the headline point is that nothing from a capital standpoint that would be different than we talked about before. These are relatively small amounts of capital deployment on an individual level. It's more about as Dan was covering the strategic connection and of this capability from an advisor standpoint and our long-term growth."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Tanya, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance, on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remained focused on our mission: of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This quarter we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges, and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets remained at $1.2 trillion, as continued solid organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Third quarter organic net new assets were $33 billion, representing 11% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $97 billion, representing approximately a 9% growth rate. In the quarter, Recruited Assets were $31 billion, including $12 billion from Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. Prior to large enterprises, Q3 represents a quarterly record for recruiting. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model, as well as our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same store sales, our advisors remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients, and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination that drove solid same store sales in Q3. With respect to Retention, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, Asset Retention for the third quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.74 of adjusted EPS, an increase of 19% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now, as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace, which, for us, means being the best at empowering advisors and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around two primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate with us, and vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of advisor needs. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisors and enterprises where they are in the evolution of their businesses by creating flexibility in our affiliation models such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable markets. Now, over the third quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, adding approximately $13 billion in assets. And as a result of the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee, and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter-to-date, recruiting roughly $5 billion in assets in Q3. Subsequent to launching these models a few years ago, we have continued to enhance their capabilities and thus further differentiate their value. Add to that the growing awareness of these models in the marketplace and that combination is creating more demand from prospective advisors. As a result, we expect to see a sustained increase in growth within our new affiliation models. Next, the traditional banking credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in Q3. During the quarter, we also continue to make progress with large enterprises, onboarding Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. The early feedback from these transitions has been positive as we continue to apply the learnings from previous onboardings to further enhance the experience. Looking ahead, we are confident that our industry-leading onboarding experience match with the expanding appeal of our model positions us well as a compelling alternative in this part of the market. In Q3, we also announced that Prudential Financial would onboard its retail wealth management business to our enterprise platform in the second half of 2024. This milestone reinforces the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises and reflects our commitment to help solve the unique and complex needs of a broad spectrum of institutions. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum and strong pipelines across the enterprise market. Now, within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on delivering a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services, and technology that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. Now, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress across several key fronts on this part of our strategy, including continuing the journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. This work includes evolving and enhancing our advisory platforms through simplified and lowered pricing, enhanced trading capabilities, value-added services like tax management, and the expanded investment choice and flexibility within our UMA platform. These efforts will help our advisors continue to provide more value for the clients in a differentiated and more personalized way. Now, as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of solid demand in Q3, the number of advisors utilizing our Services Group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,700 active users, up 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, a recent innovation in this portfolio is our Liquidity & Succession solution, which is resonating with existing LPL advisors, where to date, we have deployed approximately $275 million of capital and closed 20 deals. With the benefit of our learnings and insights, we recently began offering this solution to advisors that are external to LPL and are encouraged to see the early interest building. Finally, this service is also enriching the appeal of our model and by doing so, providing another differentiated solution to support our advisor recruiting efforts. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. Good afternoon. Steven, it's Dan. Let me take that. And certainly, we can build off of that answer. So, look, I think in the short-term, we've got a jumping off point that, as you said, is in the solid place of 11% growth for the quarter. And probably just as importantly, we saw a diverse contribution across all of our advisor and enterprise models, which I think speaks to not only the volume of growth, but the breadth and diversity of the sources of growth. And I think if I highlighted a couple of things inside Q3 that maybe are significant to that overall outcome, the first would be we continue to see low levels of attrition in that 1% to 1.5% zone. That's certainly a solid outcome and reinforces the appeal and the execution quality of the operation day to day. And I think it's complemented by the solid performance in new store sales where we recruited $31 billion of assets for the quarter. And if you click down on that $31 billion of assets, I think if you look at that prior to large enterprises, right, Q3 has quarterly high recruiting of $19 billion in assets, which is more than double a year ago. And I think when you take out or back out some of the lumpier nature of some of the large enterprise recruiting you put down underneath that, again, you see the diversity of that growth in new store sales, as well as it happening across all of our different advisor-oriented models. And you feel pretty good about the sustainability of that opportunity set. And so look, the drivers of that, right, the flexibility of the affiliation model gives us and puts us in a position of competing for potentially any advisor that's looking for a newer, better home. It's continued expansion of our capabilities to help us differentiate our model. And then you continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding to make it easier and easier to move and take friction out. We believe we do those things well, and it creates a key contributor to our overall growth and a good, solid, sustainable growth rate as we go forward. So I hope that helps. Let me start with answering that, and then Matt will come in and answer maybe the second part of that. And so look at the headline level, if you take a step back and just look at the large enterprise opportunity set with respect to the bank space as you know we onboarded two new large enterprises this quarter, and we continue to see a opportunity set in that large enterprise space of those that continue to act as their own broker dealers and RIAs and do the business in-house and see an interesting TAM that would consider a different strategic approach. And so I think those wins reinforced that value proposition. Our continued investment in this and our experience in managing and working with these large enterprises did certainly help us as we go forward in that part of the large enterprise space. And as you said the announcement of the Pru win kind of opens up a different part of large enterprises, in this case perhaps insurance-owned solution sets and/or part of the market space. And look, for there, we think \u2013 again we take that similar chassis. We're building some personalized and interesting customized solutions for Prudential that we think will resonate with other solutions in that part of the space. They've got similar needs from a value proposition standpoint when you think about the improvement driving efficiencies within their models, shifting their risk profiles, enhancing economics, and even working to stimulate top-line growth, all things that I think similar large enterprises are looking to do. These are things that we're working on collectively with banks and ultimately with Prudential. So we think there is a relevant opportunity. We think Prudential opportunity is a catalyst to open up more discussions in that part of the space. So we think, again, that the broader enterprise, large enterprise market is an interesting continued durable growth opportunity for us, both on the bank side and on the broader insurance, if that helps. Yes. Thanks, Matt. And so look, if you think about our services portfolio, just start with a broader context, and then we'll put down your specific question. Initially, when we rolled out these solutions or this services portfolio, the initial bundle of services were really more relevant for our larger practices. If you didn't have a complex practice, let's use it as an example, our initial rollout of CFO solutions, then that solution may not be relevant to you, or it may be at a price point that makes it out of reach for you. And so learning through that sort of first iteration around of innovation, we realized that a lot of the capabilities within the original CFO solutions were needed for all advisors to figure out how to package those in a different way at a lower price point and still create that leverage point of value for our advisors, then that would be a good problem to solve for and one that would create real value for our advisors. And so that's what you saw with this new rollout of what we call CFO Essentials that \u2013 again it will reach a much broader set of our 22,000-plus advisors or be much more applicable to them, and we think meet their needs at a price point that makes sense and continue then to drive the utilization and growth of that overall kind of suite of CFO-type solutions. We're doing that on the marketing side as well. So these are just, I think, places where we continue to innovate on that overall portfolio. For the fine point on that, we now have 13 solutions in our overall services portfolio, of which many of them are relevant across or could be relevant across our entire advisor base. We've got three more solutions that we will roll out in the near to intermediate term and another handful in incubation. So it continues to be a place of innovation for us, and we think there is still a good bit of opportunity to continue to help build leverage points for advisors in the spirit of helping them run thriving businesses. So that's kind of the context around CFO Essentials. Yes, Devin, so this is Dan. Let me try to cover those sort of different points that you're exploring. I think first and foremost, if you look at overall just advisory growth in general, right, you continue to see success and progress we have in both same-store sales and new-store sales across, again, all of our different types of affiliation models. So that would cover your corporate RIA, your hybrid RIA solutions, your pure RIA solutions. And I think we still see about $0.75 of every new dollar invested go into advisory. So that's where you're going to pick up the contribution from same-store sales. And you still see conversions or transitions from brokerage to advisory services. Those are your tailwinds that are overall driving that advisory growth. I think if you pull back then and look at the different affiliation models and how we're positioned in the marketplace, certainly the diversity of our different models continues to help us attract a diverse set of advisors and advisors that, quite frankly, do more and more advisory when they join LPL. And you're seeing that in the traditional space as we continue to attract more and more larger advisors with more complex practices. If you look across our different new affiliation models, right, employee strategic wealth and pure RIA, a lot of those will be breakaways from wires that will come with significant advisory books. And if you just click down on those new affiliation models, as we said, this would have represented a record in terms of recruiting $5 billion of assets. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've actually recruited $14 billion in new assets to those affiliation models, which is 50% of what we've overall recruited since they've been launched. And certainly that mix of business that tends to have more significant percentages of their books and advisory is, again, another driver. And I think as we continue to have success with those models, as we continue to invest in them, they become more and more appealing, there is more and more awareness of them, and thus more demand. We certainly are well positioned to see that advisory business flow. I think specifically relative to maybe your question around Schwab and Ameritrade, it's probably more the pure RIA business, and we do see that as a continued interesting place, of which to compete and try to win. So we continue to invest in our solution and our model to ensure that we create a differentiated solution that will help us be positioned to win and capitalize on whether it be market share opportunity that's created by consolidation or just ongoing demand for that type of solution. And I think as we try to position ourselves as a more vertically integrated strategic partner that creates more value for the adviser, we think that positions us well to participate and win an outsized share of market as we move forward in this space. Yes. So for us, I think I'd answer that more broadly that we see all registered advisers as an opportunity to potentially affiliate with one of our models, and we obviously invest in a significant business development team that's out in the marketplace, exploring those opportunities. I think we continue to create real structural value that creates demand and appeal across our model, it's first and foremost, the opportunity. But if you're doing that well, and you have the efficacy of a good business development team you will then when market opportunities may arise in the short run, and we challenge ourselves to be agile and nimble to be able to capitalize on those regardless of what they may be and when they may occur. And so that's the combination that we think about how we go to market, right? You create good structural differentiation and value, you have a great team that can go tell that story and then you're agile and nimble when opportunities come up that may be created for whatever reason. So look, when there's transitions that occur in the marketplace, just in general back to your other question, there's generally opportunity that may occur around the transition of assets from one custodian to another or one broker-dealer from another. And depending on the complexity that may occur in that transition, typically, then there's some opportunity that may arise post that, whether that be because of new environment, service challenges, new technology, whatever the case may be change management challenges that may occur, that may create some unrest. And that may create some opportunity. And again, I think we try to be well positioned and well prepared to capitalize pre-conversions, post-conversions when those may occur and where that opportunity may occur. I hope that helps. Yes. So look, I think the headline, as we said earlier, from a recruiting standpoint is we continue to see that as a solid lever and driver of growth or contributor to growth both in the short run and longer term. So if I just put a little color on that for you, when we look out at the environment explore how we position ourselves to win we typically start with the opportunity set where you went to advisor movement. I would actually reflect it as more flat over the last year, it's somewhere around 5.5% movement or turnover. We haven't seen a big move up from that, but it's more sustained and we call it that range down for now. What has happened is there has been a bit of a mix shift in some of the movement or turnover where we've seen the movement amongst the independent market picked up where some of the movement has slowed down from the wires as an example. That said, given all of that look, I think, what we do is challenge ourselves into how do you succeed regardless of the volume of movement. And I think we continue to see our win rates improve despite the lower level of movement. And with the diversification of our models, right, that mix shift that I spoke to is more of a neutral point for us as, again, we try to compete competitively [ph] for all 300,000 advisers that may move. So the overall churn we've overcome those lower levels of churn. We do think that they will come back over time. There is lots of reason to believe that that number begins to pick up and more trend back towards the norm. And so if we can sustain higher win rates because we've got a more appealing model, we've gotten better at recruiting matched with the flexibility of our model, I think, we think that positions us well as we go forward. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, again, we haven't seen significant changes or material changes across the playing field there. That said, what we talked about in the last question, there are moments in time in the marketplace where there may be some elevated movement because an organization is going through some strategic transition. And we always try to position ourselves there to get a bit of an over index gain on those opportunities when they may occur. I think if you add all of that up and you look out over the intermediate term, if you look at our growing pipeline, the growing sort of appeal of our different affiliation models, the strength of our adviser recruiting matched with the nice complement of bigger mandates in the enterprise marketplace. And we feel good about our short and intermediate opportunity for recruiting. And then longer term, I think, we go back to our structural advantages and really back to our strategy where we continue to see a growing appeal and demand for advice, the attractiveness of the adviser or the independent model matched with the desire to receive that model from a financial professional. The overall demand for advice continues to give us a big tailwind. You take our market leadership in the independent model singular focused on really understanding and innovating in it, robust feature platform we have to jump off from in our capacity and commitment to invest back into the model. And we think that certainly positions us long term to capitalize on current large demand that exists today, but the growing demand for advice is going to create more opportunity going forward and our ability to differentiate. Hope that helps. Yes. Well, I think when you look at the drivers, it's really three things. And I think on that last point, it on the 100 million for potential it related to large financial institutions and those institutions coming on board. So I think the \u2013 we think about our opportunity set, I think we would expect to have those be an ongoing opportunity. But to the core of your question, if there weren't any in a year or there weren't any large financial institutions coming on board those expenses would go away. That 100 million is specific to Prudential. Meaning once that's onboarded, unless there's others coming on board you wouldn't have a spend level of that amount. But the other and the key drivers though of the growth overall outside of the number of large financial institutions or enterprises we have, are coming on board is really organic growth, right? And I think when you look at the amount of organic growth that we have the transition assistance associated with that and the amortization of that, that's primarily what shows up in the growth for promotional. And it's about the size of our recruiting. I think we've talked about it a bunch on this call and during this Q&A. But the amount of recruited AUM that we're bringing on board is increased substantially in the capital that helps bring that on board and the expense shows up here. The other one I'd highlight to a much smaller extent is just conference spend, right? That's based on the number of advisors we have at the firm. The bigger we get, the more value there is in engaging with more of those folks in person at our conferences that would naturally rise. But I think the two key things are number of large financial institutions coming on board and then just the level and amount of our organic growth. Those would be the two big drivers. Yes. And that's associated with Prudential as well. So if you think about Prudential overall of $325 million of investment and reminder, there's no transition assistance that comes along with it. That's the total investment. So that the timing will be like typical to a large financial institution. It will be mostly leading up to and during the quarter of onboarding, but there can also be some that comes across after that. And then you get into, based on the technology that we're putting in place, which are typically amortization periods called in the four or five year zone once they're deployed. Yes, yes. One once it's deployed, four or five years following this, I think that's a good way to think about it. Okay. So let me take that one in. And so look, there is a DOL proposal that's under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and that's the procedural step as you know, before the proposals released to the public comments. So there's not a lot of insight on what's contained inside of that. I think there's been a lot of speculative dialogue about what that may be. But I think we'll learn more as you know, we move to the next step. I think what we do believe is that once it moves to public comment, it's a long process of which to work through ultimately either some proposed change that may occur from that and or not. And so I think you'll see a good public dialogue about what's being considered. That said, I think we did, as you said, did significant work back in 2016 and had some cool innovation even around some products like mutual funds as an example that didn't ultimately wasn't ultimately utilized as we \u2013 as the 2016 fiduciary rule was struck down and ultimately pivoted to the Regulation Best Interest, what is different. And I think and by the way, that will serve as a great baseline, a lot of the innovative work that we did, some we use today in Reg BI, some we're not using, and we think it prepares us well of which to ultimately pivot and or adjust for whatever changes may occur in the rule. I do think that the dialogue around the rule itself is a bit different in context. The circumstances are different than as you know Reg BI has just really been released out into the marketplace for a couple of years. And we do think it is a, it proposes a higher standard of care, which we are aligned with and we think the SEC is the right regulator to create that rule across all parts of business, both retirement and non-retirement. And consequently we think that because of that rule is in place, the consideration set for that and allowing that to run its course and ensure that it's effective in ultimately establishing and aligning around that higher standard of care. We think has a lot of relevance in the dialogue that will occur. And if you go back to some of the proposals in 2016, I think there is the big risk that ultimately you take away choice and that begins to harm low and middle income investors by limiting access to brokerage advice for those smaller retirement accounts, which obviously in systemically it's not a good outcome. It would be a big unintended influence, which I think you'll have a lot of pushback and a lot of relevant concern around that potential outcome. So we just believe the circumstances are different to have this sort of public debate and open the view around the process. All that said, if there are some changes incrementally we do think we're well prepared to pivot and add those and continue to deliver choice between both brokers and advisory. Always believe as principal choices of other option and we think it'll serve investors much, much better. So I hope that gives you a little color. The point is we don't really know yet. I think there is something that is being considered and we think it'll be a good healthy debate and we'll be well prepared. Yes. So look, I think \u2013 let me take the strategic part of that and then I'll turn it over to Matt to ask your capital or to address your capital question. So look, the liquidity and succession solution that we came up with was on the premise of solving a big need, right? A third of advisors potentially requiring over the next 10 years, certainly a relevant problem to solve. And the team did a great job of coming up with a differentiated creative solution that has ultimately been very appealing to existing LPL advisors that were facing that same problem and challenge. And I think because of its differentiated nature it made sense for us to take those learnings and insights and then go potentially offer that outside of our platform in doing that high probability to those assets. And if we offered it to the external marketplace, would then move to the LPL platform, that would be the concept as another way to motivate them to move to our platform. Because of the demand and the interest that we've generated internally because of the learnings that we've had just in the basically 45 days we've been in market around it. We think it's going to have some interest and be broadly appealing to the outside marketplace. We'll learn more hard to size right now because we just don't have enough data to support that. But we do think it's appealing in another way to attract assets to the LPL platform and be a smart deployment of capital in order to do so. So that's kind of where we are now in that journey. More to come as we learn more. But at least that's how we think about it strategically. With respect to our other services that we may offer outside of the platform. I think we continue to have set that aside as a future possibility. We continue to see opportunity internally on with respect to our growing number of advisories on the LPL platform and innovating on new solutions and expanding that portfolio set versus broadening the distribution outside of the LPL platform. So think about that as our near-term focus, continue to add more services and in supporting our growing platform here. I do think it's a relevant question at some point to ask. Could you logically apply that outside of our advisory base, you want take that?"

Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remained focused on our mission, of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the advisor-mediated market. In that spirit, we remain focused on helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. With respect to organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $22 billion, representing 7.4% annualized growth or approximately 8% when adjusted for seasonal tax payment. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of 84% billion representing approximately an 8% organic growth rate. In Q2, recruited assets were $19 billion, which represents a quarterly record, excluding periods when on-boarding large enterprises. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.94 adjusted EPS, an increase of 76% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Our long-term vision is to become a leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisors and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisors in their efforts to be extraordinary business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organized our work around two primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisors in the adviser-mediated market. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of adviser needs and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value. With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisors and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation model, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and for the client. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation. Now over the quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $14 billion in assets. At the same time, due to the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic well employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets in Q2. In each of these models, we continue to experience growing demand and expanding pipeline which position them for increased contribution for our organic growth. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q3 for both our traditional independent market and our new affiliation. Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also recently announced the planned acquisition of Ground Capital, a California-based firm with approximately 260 advisors and $6.5 billion client assets. This transaction will give Ground Capital's advisors access to our differentiating capabilities, technology and service. We look forward to onboarding them early next year. With respect to large enterprises, we recently onboarded Bank of the West and are on track to onboard Commerce Bank in August. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our growing momentum and strong pipeline across the broader enterprise market, including in our traditional bank and credit loans. Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving business. In that spirit, this quarter, we launched a new performance optimization solution called Practice Hub. This capability delivers comprehensive data in a structured format, so advisors can better understand their performance on an absolute and relative basis. And over the coming months, we will further expand the functionality by enabling it to generate personalized insights around additional services, technology and solutions we offer in order to help advisors enhance the overall performance of the practice. Over time, we see Practice Hub becoming a key tenet of our adviser experience, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to operate as a co-pilot for our advisors. And while we're still in early innings, we're excited about the growth opportunities that this innovation unlocks and how it will serve as an additional leverage point to help advisors run thriving business. Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services role and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of demand in Q2, the number of advisors utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,500 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year. As we work with advisors to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services, such as our tax planning solution, which is part of our broader suite of comprehensive advice and planning services. This new solution helps enable tax intelligent advice that can deliver material savings to clients and help further differentiate adviser's value proposition. This service is receiving positive early feedback in demand in the market while also unlocking interesting synergies with our existing services portfolio. Now as we continue to evolve our services portfolio, we are leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to address the needs of our broader adviser base. In that spirit, we are creating streamlined versions of existing solutions to help advisors who may have less complex products. Examples of these solutions include CFOs essentials, digital marketing and payroll, all of which are progressing through our innovation pipeline. As we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio to better support our advisors and enterprises and to drive growth. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisors and their firms while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors to further differentiate win in the marketplace and as a result, we've got long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Audette: Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession offering. In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Wealth Management business of Crown Capital, onboarded Bank of the West earlier this month and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank later this quarter. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q1 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $22 billion or a 7.4% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $19 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a new record. This included $4 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation models, which is also a new record. Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.94. Looking at gross profit, it was $990 million, down $30 million or 3% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $218 million, up $3 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and higher advisory. In Q2, our payout rate was 86.7%, up about 50 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to 87.5%, driven by typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Commerce Bank and Bank of the West. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $396 million, down $42 million from Q1, driven by a sequential decline in cash balances. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $50 billion, down $5 billion from Q1. The primary driver of the decrease was typical April seasonality when the majority of quarterly advisory fees and tax payments hit. As we move beyond April, the pace of declines moderated in both May and June. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 60% within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 322 basis points in the quarter, up 2 basis points from Q1 as the increase in short-term rates was partially offset by a decline in higher yielding floating rate balances. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances, and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points as the mix impact of lower floating rate balances is partially offset by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates. As for service and fee revenue, it was $123 million in Q2, up $4 million from Q1, primarily driven by strong organic growth. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference. Moving on to Q2 transaction limit. It was $47 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $337 million in Q2. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $10 million. We now expect our 2023 core G&A to be in a range of 1,345,000,000 to 1,370,000,000. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend in Q3, we expect our G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense. It was $107 million up $5 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboard. In Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $125 million to $130 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we will host our largest adviser conference of the year next week as well as the onboarding of two large enterprises, Bank of the West, Commercebank. Looking at share-based compensation expense with $17 million in Q2, down $1 million from Q1. In Q3, we expect share-based compensation expense to be roughly flat sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $58 million in Q2, up a modest $2 million sequentially given it was a low deployment quarter. Looking ahead to Q3, our plans for technology spend have not changed. We expect more deployments in the quarter. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to be roughly $65 million. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q2 with corporate cash of $325 million, up $91 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio was 1.2x, down from 1.3x in Q1 driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power. I would also note that earlier this month, we increased the size of our parent revolver from $1 billion to $2 billion. Given the significant growth of our business in recent years, the added capacity enables us to operate comfortably within our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x and leaves us well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth. Specific to our liquidity and succession offering, momentum is building, and we continue to have a solid pipeline. To date, we closed 15 deals for approximately $200 million, including four deals for around $50 million in Q2. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $350 million in Q2 as we took advantage of the pullback in our share price. As we look ahead to Q3, we plan to repurchase $250 million of our shares, consistent with our plan to execute on our $2 billion authorization over two years. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. Dan, why don't we start with the kind of broader discussion around organic growth. We've obviously seen a very steady improvement in recruited assets from you guys over the last few quarters 2Q of north of $18 billion. I think that was a record outside of the larger kind of enterprise recruitment that you've done. So maybe a little bit of color on what are you seeing on the ground in terms of various affiliation options that are driving this improvement? And how does this inform your net new asset growth expectations for the rest of the year?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, as a jumping off point, as you said, we saw 4% growth during the quarter. And I think prior to seasonal tax payments, you get closer to the 8% is probably to go back [ph] the top, if you think about the remainder of the year. And look, we also saw that momentum build over the last week where growth has nearly doubled with preceding quarters, excluding the impact of large enterprises. So as you said and like proactively, really strong momentum in that traditional independent model and then our new affiliation models. Drivers of Q2 results or outcomes. I think you got to look at the 1% attrition rate or versus 99% for the pension rates and look at that as a really solid and going consistent outcome over the past three quarters. And then that's complemented by the strong recruiting inside of core delivery [ph] that we talked about. I think if you look then into Q3 as we go sort of short term out into the next quarter, you saw good solid momentum building throughout the quarter across again, additional models and the affiliation models. So, we expect to see that momentum pull into Q3. And then that certainly then is complemented by the larger enterprises that are being onboarded in third quarter. So that sets up what we think is a really interesting and solid order of growth. It's driven both by the recruiting as well as low retention rates. And then we're also seeing that steady contribution from same-store sales, especially in a marketplace where we've had higher rates and equity markets moving up, advisers are getting on for batter's box [ph] for the capital, as you see in our net buys from sales. And so, we think that sets up well as we look forward to the rest of the year.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, got you. Thanks. And Matt, a follow-up for you just around cash dynamics. So you guys are currently, I think, at about 60% fixed portion of the ICA portfolio sort of well inside your long-term range, but that's been largely a function of outflows that are coming out of the variable balances. So as you look at the maturity ladder here over the next, call it, 12 months or so and assuming the curve will stay kind of in line with the forward rate, what is your appetite to maybe reinvest some of these balances into floating rates to be at the lower range of your 50% to 75% allocation fixed and then within that, maybe just a quick update on where July balance is then as well? Thanks.\nMatthew Audette: I think that was two follow-ups, Alex. Two, we'll hit them. We'll hit them for you. I think so on the target range, I think we feel good where we are, which is right in the middle of the range of 60%. And I think you know this well, but just to reiterate, we did a lot of work on setting that target range and to be a range that we're comfortable with in a range of interest rate environments and primarily focused on stability of earnings and not trying to be clear going on picking spots in moments to invest when we think the curve is good from an interest rate standpoint. So really like where we're positioned. I think the specific of your point, as those balances mature, we would intend to maintain that middle of the range. So, I don't think we need to move. But to the extent your question was when things mature, would you redeploy them, that would be - yes, that would be our perspective today. But it's really about being right in the middle of that range and being comfortable with that spot. I'd highlight, too, in the environment for placing those cash rebalances from a fixed rate has continued to improve. So the demand is there. The pricing has improved, meaning the spread above where whatever term you are on the curve. We see a similar thing on the floating rate side. So, we've got a good environment to place those deposits to the extent that we want to do so. But headline is we like where we are on the fixed rate. As far as how things are going in July, I'd say the headline is consistent with the broad adviser and investor engagement we've been seeing as well as the seasonality you would typically see in the month one of a quarter. So specifically on those cash balances, we have advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter, those are about $1.1 billion, so that will reduce cash in the month of July. And then beyond that, we've seen, again, continued strong levels of investor engagement, continued elevated levels of net buying activity. I'd say consistent with the pace in Q2 I mean if you look at our trends there, we really peaked on that buying in Q1. So, July is looking more like the pace that we saw in Q2. And I think the cash balance declines themselves coming from that just continue to moderate lower than we saw earlier in the year. And I think so far, we're in July, it's about a $600 million decline above the advisory fees of $1.1 billion. And maybe just to put that in context, when you look at the pace of decline we've seen since the moderation, which would be starting in May. It's about 1/5th the pace of decline that we saw earlier in the year, earlier in the year being January to April. So, we're seeing that moderation. Balance is still coming down slightly, but a much, much, much lower pace. And while we're talking to, I know you didn't ask about it, I'll give you an answer to the fourth question you didn't ask, which is how organic growth is going in the month of July. And kind of building on Dan's comments, the momentum, especially from a recruiting standpoint, just continues into July that we saw in the first and second quarter. So prior to bringing on Bank of the West, we're tracking in the 6% to 6.5% growth -- organic growth zone for July, which compare that to July of last year, which was in the low 4% range. So it's a nice improvement there. And then just under $5 billion of assets for Bank of the West will come on in July. When you add that, we're looking at organic growth of around 11% for the month. So taking a step back, we described July is just the momentum we saw in Q2 just continuing in a real positive way.\nAlexander Blostein: Perfect. And thank you for all that.\nMatthew Audette: You bet.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much. Just want to start on the enterprise channel. Obviously, LPL now has a number of large validating wins there. Data that's built here with partners that you can now show to potential partners in the future. And so, I'd just love to talk about how the narrative has changed with enterprises where you can really explicitly show them the value prop. And at the same time, it seems like the bar just around regulatory and scale, which is only moving higher and higher for enterprises to operate through a broker-dealer. So, I just love to maybe hash it out a little bit and then what that means if anything for your pipeline there? Thanks.\nDan Arnold: Devin, where you are, your hypothesis is right, obviously, as the business model has seasoned in and we have the clients who have experienced real results, right? The evolution of the dialogue is sort of a natural one as you suggested. And I think - so first and foremost, you start out with capabilities and make sure that hypothetically, they're going to enhance the economics. They're going to streamline and enhance the client experience. They're going to create a more scalable model and a more competitive one for even tracking and maintaining better advisers. And then I think as we've been - you can ultimately make sure that capabilities to do that, and you can pull through those results and that creates then the opening and the white space to focus more time on then how do you help them go that business through the expansion of advisers and the practices as well as activity is. And I think that's sort of the rhythm that we're finding where you produce those positive outcomes of enhanced risk management, operational efficiency and enhanced economics. And now we're in that stage of very intentional working to help them grow organically their ultimate results within their wealth management programs and platform. I think the other thing that we've been able to do is seasonal is completely reimagined and transform the onboarding or change management effort to bring these programs onto the platform. That's always somewhat of an obstacle to work through any time as part of the value proposition. And I think the easier lower, we can make that hurdle. And then with the experience of being able to record expire outcomes, that's certainly is helping, I think, streamline not only make the model more appealing, but also make it sort of more beaches accessible right. So we hurdle [ph] that's there. And so, that's where we are in the dialogue is being able to use those outcomes have a dialogue with larger enterprises traditionally the banks, but also expanding that value proposition outside of just banks to that broader enterprise by marketplace. And so as we do that, it's a longer sales cycle, but the pipeline continues to grow. And we feel really confident as we go forward that this is a growth that contributor to organic.\nDevin Ryan: Okay and thanks. We appreciate the color now. Just a follow-up on some of the technology initiatives. So I think last year, you guys have spent $270 million on technology. That's clearly growing again this year, and that's going to be many multiples of really the vast majority of your peers. And so I'd love to just maybe digging a little bit deeper. And if you can frame just the degree and importance of kind of this technology differentiation that you think you're building at LPL for those peers. And you touched on AI, Dan, the prepared remarks and application there. So just kind of interplay with that and maybe how you're thinking about AI applications just more broadly to improve the experience for advisers and also help reduce costs at the firm over time? Thanks.\nDan Arnold: Yes, absolutely. So, we do think that the quality of the capability set, if you think about that vertical integration concept that we described to you, we think that is one of the most important elements of creating the model and driving organic growth. So with that as context and we think investing in that vertical integration strategy or reinvesting in that platform to enhance capabilities is a significant priority. And we should allocate capital appropriately relevant to that on - so I gave you a bit of a framework to think about where we invest there. I give it to you over kind of six elements. One would be the end plan experience. So that's the adviser helping them with a holistic advice to continue to enrich 1 of the key elements of the art of being a financial advisers, all the advice. Third one is the wealth management platform that's been for how they solve the needs of clients next feed on their advice. And then the other three elements are more about helping them operate successful and in advising business. So think about flexibility to building the perfect practice for them. That's where you get the affiliation models, that's where you also get the investment in service -- business services portfolio that we've been talking about it now. That's where you also get the investment in operating it. We want to make sure that we create a favorable and efficient platform, which all of these advisers spin practice in. And then ultimately, I think we've got an enhancement of our overall service - those are the six categories that I call them commercial categories or in the context of needs for our clients that we're investing in both technology, capital for technology purposes and then also non-technology think about services. And if we're creating this integrated platform, it creates better workflows and better services wrapped around that technology that ultimately help these advisers to create advisers and run driving businesses we think that's a winning formula to continue to create a more appealing platform that drives more successful outcomes for advisers. With respect to your question around AI and where we sprinkle that in terms of that investment along the operating platform itself and within our service model, we're already using AI both in terms of think about robotics, machine learning as a way to scale, predictable and feasible operating processes. We're using AI in terms of enhancing the efficacy of our data analytics and determining aspects, action associated with our risk management efforts within our operating platform. We've created a new digital capabilities that are now taking as much as 15% to 20% of the volume that has traditionally come into our service model to help folks with a better digital experience and incorporates an AI into that. And I think with generative AI, where you get into using AI for more creative activities, we see the interesting opportunity to continue to enhance both the adviser and the investor experience on Uber chance personalization. I think also we see it as an opportunity to create efficiency in our own models where you think about those creative jobs, take them marketing, take engineers baked again in service and operations, and you begin to really think about enhancing the scalability of the model. So the reason we invest it gives you a little flare for kind of how we're allocating that investment and then how we're beginning to explore and utilize AI. We've been using it for a couple of years, but I think with this degenerative AI or AI it opens up some interesting possibilities. We're just in the early innings of imagine. We like to ask and challenge ourselves. Imagine if we could create AI as an additional team member for every single practice, which is a highly efficient scale of the team and that's a pretty cool initiative being to solve through. I hope that helps.\nDevin Ryan: Yes, no it's very helpful. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Michael and I am going start this is on for Steven. I did want to start off going back maybe to the organic growth side. Certainly nice to see the ramp there through the end of the quarter. I did want to ask on the competitive dynamics. A larger independent player is planning to undergo a rather substantial restructuring effort. It looks like some of the resulting attrition has been a relatively significant contributor to your recruiting year-to-date. Can you help us size how significant of a tailwind that's been? And how sustainable is this source of organic growth?\nDan Arnold: Yes. So look, I think if you look at the marketplace, right, and what you're really getting at is how do we think about sizing of the marketplace, at least up through second quarter if you look at the opportunity set, adviser movement has largely remained pretty flat at around 5% turnover for the last year, which is a lower level movement than historical norms, as you well know. That said, there has been a mix shift in that sort of turnover, but we're seeing positive movement or more positive movement in the traditional independent market and there's been a slowdown from the wireless. As we look out sort of and look forward at some of what competition is doing, whether it be through integrations, restructurings, et cetera. Those things can create more churn or more turnover in the marketplace. And we think we are well positioned across all of our different affiliation models to make sure that we can capitalize should that opportunity increase and more turnover occur in the marketplace that we're well positioned, capitalized and in much greater share of that opportunity that will emerge. So we do think about structurally our opportunity, but we're also trying to position for different market opportunities that may emerge within the structural strategy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful. And then just switching over to expenses. Understanding it's a bit early maybe to be thinking about 2024 as we think about rate cuts coming down the pike and the strong organic growth you're seeing, how should we be thinking about core G&A growth beyond '23. It sounds like 4% to 5% is the first building block to run the business, but how much incremental investment should we be anticipating?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean I think we're -- as you could imagine, we're in the midst of planning for '24 right now, and we'll share our thinking on it later in the year as we typically do. But I think to your question and maybe just highlight a little bit of how we're approaching it, which is, as we normally do, is focusing first on the investments really to drive and support organic growth. And at the same time, making sure that we're delivering appropriate and compelling operating leverage and really balancing those 2 things. And I think when you look at 23%, the macro environment provided an opportunity for us to accelerate investments that we otherwise would have done in '24 and beyond. And that was driven by the opportunity that, that macro represented. So I think when we're planning for '24, it will all depend on what that macro outlook looks like. Of course, there's a scenario as you described that rates could start to come down. So we will certainly factor that in, and we've got - I think our history demonstrates we've got the flexibility to adjust based on that environment. And we've also got, I think, the confidence to invest in things that - where we have the confidence they're going to drive growth. So we'll focus on balancing those things. And we'll share more color on those plans as we typically do at our year-end earnings call. But the headline would be our principles and our approach are going to remain the same.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And if I could just squeeze a quick housekeeping 1 in here. Tax rate was elevated during the quarter. What drove that? And if you could provide an update on what the go-forward outlook for tax, that would be helpful.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I think about tax rate just as a kind of a core normalized tax rate in the 26% to 27% zone. We've been running below that for a while, primarily from tax benefits from employee stock sales and deductions that have come from that. And there were just fewer in the quarter. And that's why I kind of moved back up to that - closer to that normalized 26%, 27%. So I think all else equal, if you're looking for a placeholder for going forward. I think 26% to 27% is the best way to think.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And one moment for our next questions. And our next question will be coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open\nDan Fannon: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. In addition to strong organic growth, you've also been active on the inorganic side. So was hoping you could talk about just the pipeline and conversations and how we should think about inorganic uses of -- or for growth as we think about the remainder of this year and kind of the current backdrop of what's out there.\nDan Arnold: Yes. So as we go forward, we'll continue to use M&A as a complement to our organic growth. So no change there as you suggested. And I think, look, as we in order to do that or execute well on that, we're consistently assessing the marketplace and the landscape and are typically focused on 3 categories of opportunity, the first for transactions to grow in our markets where we can capitalize on our market leadership and add scale. In those cases, we're able to create value for the advisers and those practices when they transition onto our platform. And we look across the landscape of -- I'll think about anywhere from smaller broker-dealers and RIAs upward. Examples of that is bidding [indiscernible], and of course, most [indiscernible] from capital. So again, I think we remain focused on the marketplace we do think there will be ongoing consolidation, and we remain positioned to explore those opportunities. I think a complement to that, we also look to places or transactions that could add capabilities right, where we can create value for advisers and ultimately help them drive efficiency into their practices or enhance growth. Any time we think about that type of transaction, we'll, of course, look at it through the lens of build, buy or partner as capabilities and transactions include advisory world and [indiscernible] and those [indiscernible], we continue to really evolve how we think about investing back capabilities and how they ultimately create value in unintended places when we originate those so we like that type of opportunity. And then finally, the third is just deploying capital against the liquidity and succession needs that are out in the market. And certainly, this gives us a pathway to put capital work that meets our disciplined return thresholds and solving a really important question for advisers in the marketplace in a rather differentiated or unique way. And we've got continued opportunity internally with respect to helping our advisers. There are already on a platform with that question and we're beginning to see external exploration as well as how we help advisers that part on the platform with that type of need. So that's the framework. That's kind of where we've got our focus, and we continue to assess the marketplace for those opportunities remain.\nDan Fannon: That's helpful. And then Matt, just a follow-up on the promotional spend guide, the step-up, which you cited associated with the onboarding as well as the conference. Can you separate out that so we get a sense of kind of the economics associated with some of these larger onboarding enterprise customers?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Well, directionally. I mean, I think when you look at the guide for Q3, it's really driven by three factors. Conference timing is the biggest second on-boarding of the 2 large enterprises and third is really supporting organic growth. So I think when you look at conference spend, that is -- that first bucket, that is the biggest driver. As a reminder, it's our largest conference. It happens in Q3 every year. We've got over 8,000 attendees coming, which is a new record for us, which we're excited about, is just the engagement from our clients and their guests and being in person with us. So it's our largest conference and the largest at that conference has been. So that's the biggest component of the sequential change. Now we do have two large enterprises that we are onboarding in 1 quarter, right? So that would typically be elevated, both Bank of the West and Commerce. And then the last thing I would hit is just overall recruiting momentum. When you look at the quarter -- the strong quarters we had in Q1 and Q2 and the strength of our pipeline coming into the related transition assistance that would come from that would also be a driver. But broadly, that first bucket conferences is going to be the largest piece of that.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for our next questions. And our next question will come from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: You guys have had some early success with your newer RIA-only model. I was hoping you could talk about your competitive positioning there, how your offering and pricing differs from others in the marketplace on the RIA only model. as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months, what sort of enhancements that you might be able to make to that offering to further accelerate growth from here?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael, and happy to provide some color on enhanced RIA model. So headline is, look, the RIA market, as you know, is large and fast growing, which presents interesting strategic opportunities. So we have been investing to position ourselves for outsized share gains there. And how we think about allocating those investments, well, first and foremost, it's created a differentiated offering in the marketplace. And while at the same time, improving our awareness that we are a competitive and credible alternative to more of the income in the marketplace. So as we do this, our right to win continues to increase, and we believe that positions us well as we go forward, both in the near term and the long term. If I give you a little bit more color, as you ask on sort of how we think about enhancing the value proposition. Certainly, the flexibility in our model to handle all assets in a more integrated way on our platform continues to be an advantage. Certainly, then that's complemented by the vertical integration strategy. We're able to provide value not just at the traditional clearing custody level within the ecosystem, but also with respect to technology operating platforms, wealth management platforms, all the way down into if you think about the business services that we've been innovating on the last 3 years. And so it's an end-to-end value play that we think makes for the most interesting differentiation RAAs that are out there. So they don't have to build that or if they have that stuff and have operated in an inefficient way or one that doesn't add value, we can do it in a more efficient expected way. We think that's an appealing angle to take the marketplace. And then finally, as we grow in both the results, the solutions, the success and then greater awareness for our presence in the marketplace. We think those things position us well to continue to drive more growth from here. And I think we've seen good progress over the last 1.5 years. We're encouraged by that.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up question on the essentially managed assets that continues to grow in line with the rest of the business holding steady, about 15% of advisory assets, it looks like. So hoping you could talk about some of the initiatives as you think about expanding penetration of centrally managed assets there, how are you thinking about building out the product set here as you look out over the next year or two?\nDan Arnold: Yes, it's a really interesting question. As you said, there's some pull opportunities, we think, to continue to enhance the feel of that model and reduce the cost in both that combination ultimately, I think, drives greater and greater utilization. So with the evolution of models-based practices, our continued ability to enhance our platform that really sets up for that efficient models-based practice and even then partnering with our sponsors to integrate their capabilities within that model's marketplace is where some cool innovation and work is going on. That not only adds value for our advisers, it also creates value for our sponsors that will then economic opportunities for us. I think as you look at continued what I might call it value for an end investor think self-indexing or individual indexing and/or tax overlay. And I think we're deploying some of those capabilities in the second half of this year. just further strengthen the value of the advice that the adviser is providing to their clients, but also to the sense that we can do that in the centrally managed platform and highly efficient and integrated way for the adviser creates greater fuel and let the model. And then finally, just the expansion of the investment content available there, we've really expanded our SMAs this year. On the equity side, we're adding income SMAs in the second half of this year. And so ultimately, that turns it into a true UMA, which will only drive further utilization. So those are the ways we think about some of the ways of enhancing the capabilities to continue to drive the appeal of that model and thus the greater yields.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for your next question. Our next question will be coming from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi good evening. Maybe a few follow-ups for me. Matt, you had record EBITDA margins in the first half of the year at 54%. And I guess my question is not as much about 2024, but more of a longer-term question about margins. If we think about LPLA continuing to kind of gain scale and drive growth over the coming years, do you think there's still significant operating leverage left in the model from where you sit today at 54%. And if so, can you kind of help quantify how you think about those longer-term incremental margins?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean I think when you -- if you look at our margins and history here is very helpful and the macro environment, the interest rate environment, of course, is going to inform those. But I think when you've looked historically, I think not only us, but our industry, when you're in periods where interest rates are near their lows, like running in the -- which we, in our recent past, of course, have seen when you're running with margins in the 35%, 40% range, you're doing somewhat well in that environment. And when you're in an environment like we're in now, with interest rates high, getting up to that 50% and above, I think it's just running at a good level as well. And I think those are just good bookends to think about in general. I think as far as what we can deliver in the future, I think, ultimately, it's going to be connected to our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to clients, our ability to continue to expand and grow across our affiliation models as we get scale in each of those areas. We're able to balance delivering not only a great experience for those clients, but also doing it in an efficient way that allows us to deliver earnings to the bottom line and always balancing how much of that to then reinvest to drive further growth from here. So I think the opportunity, if we're successful in all those areas is indexing to the macro environment point that I made to most certainly drive more operating leverage. And I think ultimately, the balance and judgment about how much of that to reinvest to further expand our value proposition and further drive growth as judgment calls that we'll make. But I think the opportunity is there for successful.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And then just a follow-up on the cash discussion. You've previously noted that 4% as being around a floor level on cash as a percentage of assets, it sounds like you're now slightly below that 4% level in July to date. But it seems, as you said you're continuing to see that slowing cash declines, excluding those fee billings. I just wanted to reconfirm whether anything has changed at all from an adviser behavior standpoint over the past months or quarters that would lead to a different view in terms of defining that floor level of cash at around 4%.\nMatthew Audette: No. I mean, I think keep in mind, month 1 of any quarter, you typically see a cash balance decline. But I think as we maybe take a step back and the nature of the cash that we have in these accounts is largely operational, it's typically small balances for rebalancing, paying fees, facilitating customer throws. And I think when we just look at our experience when clients are fully deployed into the market, cash does typically bottom out at those levels required to manage the account. And that typically meant a natural for around 4%. And I think -- when we look at the market we're in now, I think it's fair to say that advisers and their clients are especially engaged when you've got a strong fixed income market that we've been in for quite some time, that's now getting coupled with a strengthened equity market. And that's leading to net buying activity and levels that are roughly double historical levels. So I think as we sit here, at least looking at the end of the quarter, which is where I'd focus at roughly 4% of AUM, I think the dynamics of our cash and the transactional nature hasn't changed. I think we're getting pretty close to what we would think would be full levels of deployment and kind of reaching a point of natural resistance on moving much lower. Now could it go below 4%, of course. But I think based on what we see in our analysis, we don't think it would go below 4 by a substantial amount.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for our next questions. Our last question will come from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I just got one left. Mine have been asked and answered. Any way or guidance you can provide for thinking about how the upcoming deals, the deals that you've announced and we have coming down the pipe could impact the payout rate. I know in the past, sometimes, some of the deals have had an impact. Anything coming from these upcoming deals?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. And you're - Brennan, you talked about the large enterprise onboarding Bank of the West in commerce?\nBrennan Hawken: Exactly.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Yes. I think as a general point, those larger enterprises have a higher payout rate. We have a lower -- from an AUM standpoint, we've got an advantage in serving them from a scale standpoint on the cost side. So operating margins are always compelling or compelling on those. But yes, the payout rate would -- all else equal go up. So if we -- I did give a little color on payout rate for next quarter at 87.5%, that would be driven by a handful of things, but primarily the seasonal build and the production bonus but also bringing on those large enterprises that, in general, have a higher payout than the average.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. So the 87.5% would fully bake in the impact of those two deals?\nMatthew Audette: No, it would be the following quarter because they're going to be joining during the quarter, but it's just as a headline point when we bring on large enterprises, they'll typically buy us up to pay out a little bit, not dramatically.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Audette",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession offering. In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Wealth Management business of Crown Capital, onboarded Bank of the West earlier this month and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank later this quarter. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q1 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $22 billion or a 7.4% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $19 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a new record. This included $4 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation models, which is also a new record. Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.94. Looking at gross profit, it was $990 million, down $30 million or 3% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $218 million, up $3 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and higher advisory. In Q2, our payout rate was 86.7%, up about 50 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to 87.5%, driven by typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Commerce Bank and Bank of the West. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $396 million, down $42 million from Q1, driven by a sequential decline in cash balances. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $50 billion, down $5 billion from Q1. The primary driver of the decrease was typical April seasonality when the majority of quarterly advisory fees and tax payments hit. As we move beyond April, the pace of declines moderated in both May and June. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 60% within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 322 basis points in the quarter, up 2 basis points from Q1 as the increase in short-term rates was partially offset by a decline in higher yielding floating rate balances. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances, and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points as the mix impact of lower floating rate balances is partially offset by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates. As for service and fee revenue, it was $123 million in Q2, up $4 million from Q1, primarily driven by strong organic growth. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference. Moving on to Q2 transaction limit. It was $47 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $337 million in Q2. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $10 million. We now expect our 2023 core G&A to be in a range of 1,345,000,000 to 1,370,000,000. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend in Q3, we expect our G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense. It was $107 million up $5 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboard. In Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $125 million to $130 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we will host our largest adviser conference of the year next week as well as the onboarding of two large enterprises, Bank of the West, Commercebank. Looking at share-based compensation expense with $17 million in Q2, down $1 million from Q1. In Q3, we expect share-based compensation expense to be roughly flat sequentially. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $58 million in Q2, up a modest $2 million sequentially given it was a low deployment quarter. Looking ahead to Q3, our plans for technology spend have not changed. We expect more deployments in the quarter. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to be roughly $65 million. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q2 with corporate cash of $325 million, up $91 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio was 1.2x, down from 1.3x in Q1 driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power. I would also note that earlier this month, we increased the size of our parent revolver from $1 billion to $2 billion. Given the significant growth of our business in recent years, the added capacity enables us to operate comfortably within our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x and leaves us well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth. Specific to our liquidity and succession offering, momentum is building, and we continue to have a solid pipeline. To date, we closed 15 deals for approximately $200 million, including four deals for around $50 million in Q2. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $350 million in Q2 as we took advantage of the pullback in our share price. As we look ahead to Q3, we plan to repurchase $250 million of our shares, consistent with our plan to execute on our $2 billion authorization over two years. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. I think that was two follow-ups, Alex. Two, we'll hit them. We'll hit them for you. I think so on the target range, I think we feel good where we are, which is right in the middle of the range of 60%. And I think you know this well, but just to reiterate, we did a lot of work on setting that target range and to be a range that we're comfortable with in a range of interest rate environments and primarily focused on stability of earnings and not trying to be clear going on picking spots in moments to invest when we think the curve is good from an interest rate standpoint. So really like where we're positioned. I think the specific of your point, as those balances mature, we would intend to maintain that middle of the range. So, I don't think we need to move. But to the extent your question was when things mature, would you redeploy them, that would be - yes, that would be our perspective today. But it's really about being right in the middle of that range and being comfortable with that spot. I'd highlight, too, in the environment for placing those cash rebalances from a fixed rate has continued to improve. So the demand is there. The pricing has improved, meaning the spread above where whatever term you are on the curve. We see a similar thing on the floating rate side. So, we've got a good environment to place those deposits to the extent that we want to do so. But headline is we like where we are on the fixed rate. As far as how things are going in July, I'd say the headline is consistent with the broad adviser and investor engagement we've been seeing as well as the seasonality you would typically see in the month one of a quarter. So specifically on those cash balances, we have advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter, those are about $1.1 billion, so that will reduce cash in the month of July. And then beyond that, we've seen, again, continued strong levels of investor engagement, continued elevated levels of net buying activity. I'd say consistent with the pace in Q2 I mean if you look at our trends there, we really peaked on that buying in Q1. So, July is looking more like the pace that we saw in Q2. And I think the cash balance declines themselves coming from that just continue to moderate lower than we saw earlier in the year. And I think so far, we're in July, it's about a $600 million decline above the advisory fees of $1.1 billion. And maybe just to put that in context, when you look at the pace of decline we've seen since the moderation, which would be starting in May. It's about 1/5th the pace of decline that we saw earlier in the year, earlier in the year being January to April. So, we're seeing that moderation. Balance is still coming down slightly, but a much, much, much lower pace. And while we're talking to, I know you didn't ask about it, I'll give you an answer to the fourth question you didn't ask, which is how organic growth is going in the month of July. And kind of building on Dan's comments, the momentum, especially from a recruiting standpoint, just continues into July that we saw in the first and second quarter. So prior to bringing on Bank of the West, we're tracking in the 6% to 6.5% growth -- organic growth zone for July, which compare that to July of last year, which was in the low 4% range. So it's a nice improvement there. And then just under $5 billion of assets for Bank of the West will come on in July. When you add that, we're looking at organic growth of around 11% for the month. So taking a step back, we described July is just the momentum we saw in Q2 just continuing in a real positive way. You bet. Yes. I mean I think we're -- as you could imagine, we're in the midst of planning for '24 right now, and we'll share our thinking on it later in the year as we typically do. But I think to your question and maybe just highlight a little bit of how we're approaching it, which is, as we normally do, is focusing first on the investments really to drive and support organic growth. And at the same time, making sure that we're delivering appropriate and compelling operating leverage and really balancing those 2 things. And I think when you look at 23%, the macro environment provided an opportunity for us to accelerate investments that we otherwise would have done in '24 and beyond. And that was driven by the opportunity that, that macro represented. So I think when we're planning for '24, it will all depend on what that macro outlook looks like. Of course, there's a scenario as you described that rates could start to come down. So we will certainly factor that in, and we've got - I think our history demonstrates we've got the flexibility to adjust based on that environment. And we've also got, I think, the confidence to invest in things that - where we have the confidence they're going to drive growth. So we'll focus on balancing those things. And we'll share more color on those plans as we typically do at our year-end earnings call. But the headline would be our principles and our approach are going to remain the same. Yes. I think about tax rate just as a kind of a core normalized tax rate in the 26% to 27% zone. We've been running below that for a while, primarily from tax benefits from employee stock sales and deductions that have come from that. And there were just fewer in the quarter. And that's why I kind of moved back up to that - closer to that normalized 26%, 27%. So I think all else equal, if you're looking for a placeholder for going forward. I think 26% to 27% is the best way to think. Yes. Well, directionally. I mean, I think when you look at the guide for Q3, it's really driven by three factors. Conference timing is the biggest second on-boarding of the 2 large enterprises and third is really supporting organic growth. So I think when you look at conference spend, that is -- that first bucket, that is the biggest driver. As a reminder, it's our largest conference. It happens in Q3 every year. We've got over 8,000 attendees coming, which is a new record for us, which we're excited about, is just the engagement from our clients and their guests and being in person with us. So it's our largest conference and the largest at that conference has been. So that's the biggest component of the sequential change. Now we do have two large enterprises that we are onboarding in 1 quarter, right? So that would typically be elevated, both Bank of the West and Commerce. And then the last thing I would hit is just overall recruiting momentum. When you look at the quarter -- the strong quarters we had in Q1 and Q2 and the strength of our pipeline coming into the related transition assistance that would come from that would also be a driver. But broadly, that first bucket conferences is going to be the largest piece of that. Yes. I mean I think when you -- if you look at our margins and history here is very helpful and the macro environment, the interest rate environment, of course, is going to inform those. But I think when you've looked historically, I think not only us, but our industry, when you're in periods where interest rates are near their lows, like running in the -- which we, in our recent past, of course, have seen when you're running with margins in the 35%, 40% range, you're doing somewhat well in that environment. And when you're in an environment like we're in now, with interest rates high, getting up to that 50% and above, I think it's just running at a good level as well. And I think those are just good bookends to think about in general. I think as far as what we can deliver in the future, I think, ultimately, it's going to be connected to our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to clients, our ability to continue to expand and grow across our affiliation models as we get scale in each of those areas. We're able to balance delivering not only a great experience for those clients, but also doing it in an efficient way that allows us to deliver earnings to the bottom line and always balancing how much of that to then reinvest to drive further growth from here. So I think the opportunity, if we're successful in all those areas is indexing to the macro environment point that I made to most certainly drive more operating leverage. And I think ultimately, the balance and judgment about how much of that to reinvest to further expand our value proposition and further drive growth as judgment calls that we'll make. But I think the opportunity is there for successful. No. I mean, I think keep in mind, month 1 of any quarter, you typically see a cash balance decline. But I think as we maybe take a step back and the nature of the cash that we have in these accounts is largely operational, it's typically small balances for rebalancing, paying fees, facilitating customer throws. And I think when we just look at our experience when clients are fully deployed into the market, cash does typically bottom out at those levels required to manage the account. And that typically meant a natural for around 4%. And I think -- when we look at the market we're in now, I think it's fair to say that advisers and their clients are especially engaged when you've got a strong fixed income market that we've been in for quite some time, that's now getting coupled with a strengthened equity market. And that's leading to net buying activity and levels that are roughly double historical levels. So I think as we sit here, at least looking at the end of the quarter, which is where I'd focus at roughly 4% of AUM, I think the dynamics of our cash and the transactional nature hasn't changed. I think we're getting pretty close to what we would think would be full levels of deployment and kind of reaching a point of natural resistance on moving much lower. Now could it go below 4%, of course. But I think based on what we see in our analysis, we don't think it would go below 4 by a substantial amount. Yes. And you're - Brennan, you talked about the large enterprise onboarding Bank of the West in commerce? Yes. Yes. I think as a general point, those larger enterprises have a higher payout rate. We have a lower -- from an AUM standpoint, we've got an advantage in serving them from a scale standpoint on the cost side. So operating margins are always compelling or compelling on those. But yes, the payout rate would -- all else equal go up. So if we -- I did give a little color on payout rate for next quarter at 87.5%, that would be driven by a handful of things, but primarily the seasonal build and the production bonus but also bringing on those large enterprises that, in general, have a higher payout than the average. No, it would be the following quarter because they're going to be joining during the quarter, but it's just as a headline point when we bring on large enterprises, they'll typically buy us up to pay out a little bit, not dramatically."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Tanya, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remained focused on our mission, of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients. This quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the advisor-mediated market. In that spirit, we remain focused on helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. With respect to organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $22 billion, representing 7.4% annualized growth or approximately 8% when adjusted for seasonal tax payment. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of 84% billion representing approximately an 8% organic growth rate. In Q2, recruited assets were $19 billion, which represents a quarterly record, excluding periods when on-boarding large enterprises. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.94 adjusted EPS, an increase of 76% from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Our long-term vision is to become a leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisors and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisors in their efforts to be extraordinary business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organized our work around two primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisors in the adviser-mediated market. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of adviser needs and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value. With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisors and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation model, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and for the client. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation. Now over the quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $14 billion in assets. At the same time, due to the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic well employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets in Q2. In each of these models, we continue to experience growing demand and expanding pipeline which position them for increased contribution for our organic growth. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q3 for both our traditional independent market and our new affiliation. Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also recently announced the planned acquisition of Ground Capital, a California-based firm with approximately 260 advisors and $6.5 billion client assets. This transaction will give Ground Capital's advisors access to our differentiating capabilities, technology and service. We look forward to onboarding them early next year. With respect to large enterprises, we recently onboarded Bank of the West and are on track to onboard Commerce Bank in August. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our growing momentum and strong pipeline across the broader enterprise market, including in our traditional bank and credit loans. Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving business. In that spirit, this quarter, we launched a new performance optimization solution called Practice Hub. This capability delivers comprehensive data in a structured format, so advisors can better understand their performance on an absolute and relative basis. And over the coming months, we will further expand the functionality by enabling it to generate personalized insights around additional services, technology and solutions we offer in order to help advisors enhance the overall performance of the practice. Over time, we see Practice Hub becoming a key tenet of our adviser experience, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to operate as a co-pilot for our advisors. And while we're still in early innings, we're excited about the growth opportunities that this innovation unlocks and how it will serve as an additional leverage point to help advisors run thriving business. Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services role and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of demand in Q2, the number of advisors utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,500 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year. As we work with advisors to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services, such as our tax planning solution, which is part of our broader suite of comprehensive advice and planning services. This new solution helps enable tax intelligent advice that can deliver material savings to clients and help further differentiate adviser's value proposition. This service is receiving positive early feedback in demand in the market while also unlocking interesting synergies with our existing services portfolio. Now as we continue to evolve our services portfolio, we are leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to address the needs of our broader adviser base. In that spirit, we are creating streamlined versions of existing solutions to help advisors who may have less complex products. Examples of these solutions include CFOs essentials, digital marketing and payroll, all of which are progressing through our innovation pipeline. As we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio to better support our advisors and enterprises and to drive growth. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisors and their firms while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors to further differentiate win in the marketplace and as a result, we've got long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, as a jumping off point, as you said, we saw 4% growth during the quarter. And I think prior to seasonal tax payments, you get closer to the 8% is probably to go back [ph] the top, if you think about the remainder of the year. And look, we also saw that momentum build over the last week where growth has nearly doubled with preceding quarters, excluding the impact of large enterprises. So as you said and like proactively, really strong momentum in that traditional independent model and then our new affiliation models. Drivers of Q2 results or outcomes. I think you got to look at the 1% attrition rate or versus 99% for the pension rates and look at that as a really solid and going consistent outcome over the past three quarters. And then that's complemented by the strong recruiting inside of core delivery [ph] that we talked about. I think if you look then into Q3 as we go sort of short term out into the next quarter, you saw good solid momentum building throughout the quarter across again, additional models and the affiliation models. So, we expect to see that momentum pull into Q3. And then that certainly then is complemented by the larger enterprises that are being onboarded in third quarter. So that sets up what we think is a really interesting and solid order of growth. It's driven both by the recruiting as well as low retention rates. And then we're also seeing that steady contribution from same-store sales, especially in a marketplace where we've had higher rates and equity markets moving up, advisers are getting on for batter's box [ph] for the capital, as you see in our net buys from sales. And so, we think that sets up well as we look forward to the rest of the year. Devin, where you are, your hypothesis is right, obviously, as the business model has seasoned in and we have the clients who have experienced real results, right? The evolution of the dialogue is sort of a natural one as you suggested. And I think - so first and foremost, you start out with capabilities and make sure that hypothetically, they're going to enhance the economics. They're going to streamline and enhance the client experience. They're going to create a more scalable model and a more competitive one for even tracking and maintaining better advisers. And then I think as we've been - you can ultimately make sure that capabilities to do that, and you can pull through those results and that creates then the opening and the white space to focus more time on then how do you help them go that business through the expansion of advisers and the practices as well as activity is. And I think that's sort of the rhythm that we're finding where you produce those positive outcomes of enhanced risk management, operational efficiency and enhanced economics. And now we're in that stage of very intentional working to help them grow organically their ultimate results within their wealth management programs and platform. I think the other thing that we've been able to do is seasonal is completely reimagined and transform the onboarding or change management effort to bring these programs onto the platform. That's always somewhat of an obstacle to work through any time as part of the value proposition. And I think the easier lower, we can make that hurdle. And then with the experience of being able to record expire outcomes, that's certainly is helping, I think, streamline not only make the model more appealing, but also make it sort of more beaches accessible right. So we hurdle [ph] that's there. And so, that's where we are in the dialogue is being able to use those outcomes have a dialogue with larger enterprises traditionally the banks, but also expanding that value proposition outside of just banks to that broader enterprise by marketplace. And so as we do that, it's a longer sales cycle, but the pipeline continues to grow. And we feel really confident as we go forward that this is a growth that contributor to organic. Yes, absolutely. So, we do think that the quality of the capability set, if you think about that vertical integration concept that we described to you, we think that is one of the most important elements of creating the model and driving organic growth. So with that as context and we think investing in that vertical integration strategy or reinvesting in that platform to enhance capabilities is a significant priority. And we should allocate capital appropriately relevant to that on - so I gave you a bit of a framework to think about where we invest there. I give it to you over kind of six elements. One would be the end plan experience. So that's the adviser helping them with a holistic advice to continue to enrich 1 of the key elements of the art of being a financial advisers, all the advice. Third one is the wealth management platform that's been for how they solve the needs of clients next feed on their advice. And then the other three elements are more about helping them operate successful and in advising business. So think about flexibility to building the perfect practice for them. That's where you get the affiliation models, that's where you also get the investment in service -- business services portfolio that we've been talking about it now. That's where you also get the investment in operating it. We want to make sure that we create a favorable and efficient platform, which all of these advisers spin practice in. And then ultimately, I think we've got an enhancement of our overall service - those are the six categories that I call them commercial categories or in the context of needs for our clients that we're investing in both technology, capital for technology purposes and then also non-technology think about services. And if we're creating this integrated platform, it creates better workflows and better services wrapped around that technology that ultimately help these advisers to create advisers and run driving businesses we think that's a winning formula to continue to create a more appealing platform that drives more successful outcomes for advisers. With respect to your question around AI and where we sprinkle that in terms of that investment along the operating platform itself and within our service model, we're already using AI both in terms of think about robotics, machine learning as a way to scale, predictable and feasible operating processes. We're using AI in terms of enhancing the efficacy of our data analytics and determining aspects, action associated with our risk management efforts within our operating platform. We've created a new digital capabilities that are now taking as much as 15% to 20% of the volume that has traditionally come into our service model to help folks with a better digital experience and incorporates an AI into that. And I think with generative AI, where you get into using AI for more creative activities, we see the interesting opportunity to continue to enhance both the adviser and the investor experience on Uber chance personalization. I think also we see it as an opportunity to create efficiency in our own models where you think about those creative jobs, take them marketing, take engineers baked again in service and operations, and you begin to really think about enhancing the scalability of the model. So the reason we invest it gives you a little flare for kind of how we're allocating that investment and then how we're beginning to explore and utilize AI. We've been using it for a couple of years, but I think with this degenerative AI or AI it opens up some interesting possibilities. We're just in the early innings of imagine. We like to ask and challenge ourselves. Imagine if we could create AI as an additional team member for every single practice, which is a highly efficient scale of the team and that's a pretty cool initiative being to solve through. I hope that helps. Yes. So look, I think if you look at the marketplace, right, and what you're really getting at is how do we think about sizing of the marketplace, at least up through second quarter if you look at the opportunity set, adviser movement has largely remained pretty flat at around 5% turnover for the last year, which is a lower level movement than historical norms, as you well know. That said, there has been a mix shift in that sort of turnover, but we're seeing positive movement or more positive movement in the traditional independent market and there's been a slowdown from the wireless. As we look out sort of and look forward at some of what competition is doing, whether it be through integrations, restructurings, et cetera. Those things can create more churn or more turnover in the marketplace. And we think we are well positioned across all of our different affiliation models to make sure that we can capitalize should that opportunity increase and more turnover occur in the marketplace that we're well positioned, capitalized and in much greater share of that opportunity that will emerge. So we do think about structurally our opportunity, but we're also trying to position for different market opportunities that may emerge within the structural strategy. Yes. So as we go forward, we'll continue to use M&A as a complement to our organic growth. So no change there as you suggested. And I think, look, as we in order to do that or execute well on that, we're consistently assessing the marketplace and the landscape and are typically focused on 3 categories of opportunity, the first for transactions to grow in our markets where we can capitalize on our market leadership and add scale. In those cases, we're able to create value for the advisers and those practices when they transition onto our platform. And we look across the landscape of -- I'll think about anywhere from smaller broker-dealers and RIAs upward. Examples of that is bidding [indiscernible], and of course, most [indiscernible] from capital. So again, I think we remain focused on the marketplace we do think there will be ongoing consolidation, and we remain positioned to explore those opportunities. I think a complement to that, we also look to places or transactions that could add capabilities right, where we can create value for advisers and ultimately help them drive efficiency into their practices or enhance growth. Any time we think about that type of transaction, we'll, of course, look at it through the lens of build, buy or partner as capabilities and transactions include advisory world and [indiscernible] and those [indiscernible], we continue to really evolve how we think about investing back capabilities and how they ultimately create value in unintended places when we originate those so we like that type of opportunity. And then finally, the third is just deploying capital against the liquidity and succession needs that are out in the market. And certainly, this gives us a pathway to put capital work that meets our disciplined return thresholds and solving a really important question for advisers in the marketplace in a rather differentiated or unique way. And we've got continued opportunity internally with respect to helping our advisers. There are already on a platform with that question and we're beginning to see external exploration as well as how we help advisers that part on the platform with that type of need. So that's the framework. That's kind of where we've got our focus, and we continue to assess the marketplace for those opportunities remain. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael, and happy to provide some color on enhanced RIA model. So headline is, look, the RIA market, as you know, is large and fast growing, which presents interesting strategic opportunities. So we have been investing to position ourselves for outsized share gains there. And how we think about allocating those investments, well, first and foremost, it's created a differentiated offering in the marketplace. And while at the same time, improving our awareness that we are a competitive and credible alternative to more of the income in the marketplace. So as we do this, our right to win continues to increase, and we believe that positions us well as we go forward, both in the near term and the long term. If I give you a little bit more color, as you ask on sort of how we think about enhancing the value proposition. Certainly, the flexibility in our model to handle all assets in a more integrated way on our platform continues to be an advantage. Certainly, then that's complemented by the vertical integration strategy. We're able to provide value not just at the traditional clearing custody level within the ecosystem, but also with respect to technology operating platforms, wealth management platforms, all the way down into if you think about the business services that we've been innovating on the last 3 years. And so it's an end-to-end value play that we think makes for the most interesting differentiation RAAs that are out there. So they don't have to build that or if they have that stuff and have operated in an inefficient way or one that doesn't add value, we can do it in a more efficient expected way. We think that's an appealing angle to take the marketplace. And then finally, as we grow in both the results, the solutions, the success and then greater awareness for our presence in the marketplace. We think those things position us well to continue to drive more growth from here. And I think we've seen good progress over the last 1.5 years. We're encouraged by that. Yes, it's a really interesting question. As you said, there's some pull opportunities, we think, to continue to enhance the feel of that model and reduce the cost in both that combination ultimately, I think, drives greater and greater utilization. So with the evolution of models-based practices, our continued ability to enhance our platform that really sets up for that efficient models-based practice and even then partnering with our sponsors to integrate their capabilities within that model's marketplace is where some cool innovation and work is going on. That not only adds value for our advisers, it also creates value for our sponsors that will then economic opportunities for us. I think as you look at continued what I might call it value for an end investor think self-indexing or individual indexing and/or tax overlay. And I think we're deploying some of those capabilities in the second half of this year. just further strengthen the value of the advice that the adviser is providing to their clients, but also to the sense that we can do that in the centrally managed platform and highly efficient and integrated way for the adviser creates greater fuel and let the model. And then finally, just the expansion of the investment content available there, we've really expanded our SMAs this year. On the equity side, we're adding income SMAs in the second half of this year. And so ultimately, that turns it into a true UMA, which will only drive further utilization. So those are the ways we think about some of the ways of enhancing the capabilities to continue to drive the appeal of that model and thus the greater yields. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

With that, I would now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, Latania, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to help their clients navigate through market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and collectively helped millions of Americans continue to pursue their financial goals and aspirations. We thank them for the important work and remain focused on our mission taking care of our advisers, they can take care of their clients. Now as we look at the marketplace, we continue to experience the growing appeal of our model due to the combination of our robust and future risk platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model and capacity and commitment to invest. As a result, we continue to make solid progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the adviser-mediated market. In that spirit, we will continue to focus on helping advisers and enterprises, solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serving as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity margins. With respect to organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $21 billion, representing 7.5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $99 billion, representing approximately a 9% organic growth rate. Recruited assets were $13 billion in Q1, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to $85 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused in serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing funds. A combination that drove a sequential improvement in same-store sales in fuel, this increase occurred across all of our affiliation models led by solid growth in our enterprise team. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations company. As a result, asset retention for the first quarter was approximately 99% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.49 of adjusted EPS, which is more than double our level from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is -- on the leader across the adviser center market, which for us is being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business. Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers, deliver personalized advice and planning experience and at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisers in their efforts to the extraordinary business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. As we look ahead, we continue to see both the growing demand for advice and increasing the appeal of receiving that advice through a financial profession, and we believe that our strategy positions us well to capitalize on these key structural trends. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around two primary categories, horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 30,000 advisers in the marketplace. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities to solve for a broader spectrum of adviser means and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value. Now while our strategy has not changed, we will use the framework of horizontal expansion and vertical integration to review our strategic agility. This structure is an evolution of our strategic plays framework, and you can see how the strategic plays map to this new orientation within our investor presentation. With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisers and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation models, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and clients. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation models. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth reaching a new first quarter high of approximately $9 billion in assets. In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $3 billion in assets in Q1. In each of these models, we continue to realize growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contribution to our organic growth. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q2 for both our traditional markets and our new affiliation models. And with respect to large enterprises, today, we announced that BMO will onboard the Wealth Management business of Bank of the West to our Enterprise platform. In addition, we continue to prepare to onboard commerce. Collectively, these two deals will add approximately $11 billion of brokerage and advisory assets in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we continue to build our pipeline as demand for our model growth. Now in Q1, we also continue to have success in our traditional banking credit unit space, adding approximately $1 billion of accreted assets from this change. Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run driving business. This part of our strategy is helping advisers deliver their differentiated wisdom insight and advice wrapped in an easily accessible and highly personalized experience for the client. In that spirit, this quarter, we continued to enhance our adviser's value proposition through their funds. By introducing new account aggregation capabilities to help advisers consider their clients' holistic financial picture, by enriching the end client digital portal through the expansion of customizable self-service capabilities and by evolving our research offerings to include increased market commentary, delivered how and where it works best for the adviser. Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of solid demand in Q1, the number of advisers utilizing our service group continued to increase. And we ended the quarter at over 3,300 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year. Now as we work with advisers to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services such as our partial book sales solution, where we provide the flexibility for advisers to sell us their smaller accounts with clients that don't necessarily fit their practice, thus creating more capacity for them to focus on managing and growing their business more robust. This service has been received well, and we are seeing solid early momentum, a growing pipeline of demand. Now at the same time, we're seeing good success with our set of services that help solve the industry-wide challenge of up to 1/3 of advisers retiring over the next decade. In that spirit, over the past year, we've facilitated approximately 150 acquisitions among advisers through our M&A solutions program. And since launching our liquidity and succession capability in Q4, we have completed more than 10 of these deals with LPL advisers and have growing interest, both inside and outside of the LPL business. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2023, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the backdrop of market uncertainty, our business performed well as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. In recent years, we've invested in capabilities, technology and service to enhance the experience of advisers, enterprises and their clients. At the same time, we've maintained a strong balance sheet with significant corporate liquidity and low leverage, positioning us to support our advisers and clients in a range of macro environments. This is most recently recognized by S&P, who upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, establishing us as an investment-grade credit with both our rating agencies. By leveraging the investments in our platform and our financial strength, we continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets. Closed two strategic acquisitions, continued our momentum with our liquidity and succession capability and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank, in Bank of the West in the second half of the year. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record adjusted earnings per share. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher [Indiscernible]. Total organic net new assets were $21 billion or a 7.5% annualized growth rate. Our Q1 recruited assets were $13 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a record first quarter of the year. This included $3 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation, the largest contribution since their launch a few years ago. Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues across our traditional independent and new models, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.49, the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $1.02 billion, up $48 million or 5% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $215 million, up $43 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production. In Q1, our payout rate was 86.2%, down about 220 basis points from Q4 and largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year as well as a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 50 basis points realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5% primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production builds. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, flat to Q4 as the impact of higher short-term interest rates was offset by a sequential decline in balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $55 billion, down $10 billion, driven by record net buying of $37 million. Within our ICA portfolio, we added $3 billion of new fixed rate contracts, bringing our fixed rate balances to roughly 55% of the ICA portfolio within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 320 basis points in the quarter, up 29 basis points from Q4, primarily due to the increases in short-term rates. As for Q2, based on where interest rates are today and what we've seen with client cash balances so far in April, we expect our ICA yield to remain unchanged at approximately 320 basis. As the full quarter benefit of the Q1 rate hikes is offset by the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service fee revenue, it was $119 million in Q1, down $1 million from Q4, primarily driven by lower conference revenues, offset by seasonal increases in IRA. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue. It was $49 million, up $2 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect a seasonal decline of a couple of million dollars. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $326 million in Q1. For the full year 2023, we continue to promotional expense to increase to a range of $105 million to $110 million due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboarding as we prepare for Commerce Bank and Bank of the West to join us in the second half of this year. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $18 million in Q1, up from $12 million in Q4. In Q2, we expect a similar level of expense as the majority of our grants occur in the first 2 quarters of the year. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $56 million in Q1, up $2 million sequentially, and we expect it to increase to approximately $60 million next quarter. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $234 million, down $225 million from Q4 as we closed on 2 acquisitions during the quarter. Our leverage ratio was 1.3x, down from 1.4x in Q4, driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q1, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organically. On traditional M&A, we closed on 2 acquisitions for approximately $150 million. Within our liquidity and succession offering, we closed 7 deals for around $100 million, and we continue to have a solid pace. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $275 million in Q1. We plan to further increase share repurchases in Q2 to approximately $300 million. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation point. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So maybe just kicking things off with a question for Matt on the enterprise channel. Recently, you've seen some really strong recruiting momentum within Enterprise. I was hoping to get your perspective on whether the recent stress in the banking space bolsters the case for banks to partner with LPL. And can you help quantify just where the enterprise backlog is today versus, say, the start of the year?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I know you said for me, Steven, I think Dan is chomping up a bit on this figure.\nDan Arnold: Yes. No, look, Steve, when you have circumstances of displacement in the marketplace as you were calling out, that can create challenges and/or opportunities and circle through some of the bank failures in Q1. We think back to 2020 with the pandemic, a much more significant impact from that. I think in the case of the recent bank failures, we didn't necessarily see this disruption creating short-term opportunity because it was very short-lived and the impact somewhat muted. That said, I think at times like this, it does reinforce maybe some of the really important elements of this model. So think about it this way, the value of human center port, which creates opportunity for advisers as they are providing guidance and folks need it most in times of uncertainty. It certainly helps reinforce the deal of us as a strategic partner to advisers given our strength and scale and robust capabilities, we sort of end up being even a quality. And then finally, I think right to your question or the point of your question, it does reinforce our value proposition for enterprises and in particular banks that type of disruption may be a catalyst for exploring different strategic options or alternatives for different business lines, as an example, wealth management. And I think that certainly would create incremental demand as we go forward. Finally, our capital light model allows us to play offense and continue to invest back in the platform in order to enhance and further differentiate our reach and others perhaps can't do that in these disruptive markets are displaced a month. So I think we didn't see necessarily opportunity in the short run. I think it does reinforce the attributes of this model and it's quite helpful to our long-term growth and our positioning in the marketplace where we can kind of turn this change in the market into unity across most disruptive sort of marketplace changes. So I hope that helps.\nSteven Chubak: It's really helpful color, Dan. Matt, I was really just trying to share the well, but my follow-up is going to be for Dan here. Just on the traditional independent channel, there is some evidence that recent broker-dealer consolidation activity is driving increased adviser churn. And just given the strong NNA results that we saw in March, how does the recruiting backdrop in the traditional market compared to last year? And do you expect to see an acceleration NNA given some evidence of higher adviser trend?\nDan Arnold: Yes. Well, look, I mean, if we look just glance Q1 as perhaps jumping off to your question, Steven, you see the traditional recruiting markets in a solid place for us with $9 billion in assets. And that channel continues to continuously produce solid results and continues to increase over time as differentiation of our model and our capabilities creates a real appealing alternative to these advisers. And quite frankly, the flexibility in our different affiliation models gives them different sets of sort of problems or challenges to potentially solve for by moving to our platform that they're in a place where they're trying to evolve their practice depending where they are in the life cycle of their model. So we certainly think that just as a baseline, we continue to see that part of the market strengthening and its opportunity from a recruiting standpoint. As you look forward to your point around other changes that players in the marketplace and the independent space may be contemplating or considering that certainly would take the lower baseline of churn we've seen over the last couple of years. And obviously create what should be a much bigger appetite we set any time we change in the marketplace and new model that is going to trigger or be a catalyst for advisers to consider their sets of opportunity relative to how they practice this business going forward. And so we do believe that if those things occur, that does create more churn in the marketplace. And we take our healing model. We take the growing capabilities out of our business development team to do a great job across all of these different affiliation models. And I think we addressed it play of and capitalize on that opportunity. So that's kind of how we see the traditional marketplace, both now and if things occur in the future, we'll be ready to is for those possibilities as they may [Indiscernible].\nOperator: And our next question will come from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Okay. So you guys announced a pretty sizable win in the RIA channel, I think, a couple of weeks ago. I think it's on the larger size from what we've seen in that kind of affiliation part of your model. So I was curious if you could speak to sort of the key attributes that maybe on the business for you guys and ultimately, what does the pipeline look like? And that part of the market and maybe just remind us on sort of the economics in that channel for LPL, either in the gross profit RIA terms or else?\nDan Arnold: Thanks, Alex. This is Dan. I'll take the first part of that and then I'll flip it to Matt for kind of the part via that question. So first of all, yes, we had a nice win that you referenced a couple of weeks ago that we announced where the team did a great job of attracting CD Advisor Network, which is a new large RIA. And those apps will show up actually in second quarter or the current quarter that we're in. And look, I think this win does a couple of things. First and foremost, reinforces the strong work the team is doing to create a really compelling and differentiated solution in this part of the market. A great example perhaps of that is how we're using our services portfolio to give these RIAs access to differentiated tools and resources, they had always had availability to access to, which are really meant to help them better operate with businesses as they go forward once on our platform. So that's a great example of how we're building in what I might call a baseline of capability set and differentiation that can think is creating a more robust appeal for this part of the marketplace. I think if you click down specifically on CGA adviser network, and what were some of the attributes that may be attracted them, one, our very advisory-centered model I think coupled with innovative technology that they can create integrated workflows for driving efficiency in the practice and finally, in the flexibility of our solution to handle all of their assets in more integrated way on one platform. And so at a high level, those were probably some of the bigger attributes that they were attracted to. And so look, I think as we look forward, overall, we're really excited about the opportunity and the momentum is building in this model. We have a number of new clients that have joined us so far this year as we referenced in the recruiting in Q1. And certainly, there's more opportunities that are progressing in the pipeline. So we'll continue to invest in the capabilities here as we see this as a very attractive market to create that differentiated model and continue to contribute and accelerate growth. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on both that particular affiliation model and then specifically with CG Advisor Network.\nMatthew Audette: And then Alexander, on the economics, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the enterprise channel or the large financial institutions, where on the RIA side, it would typically have a lower gross profit ROA, but the cost and specifically, the acquisition costs are also lower. So I will underwrite returns. So you get to a bottom line margin and economics that are compelling and similar to the rest of the business, but you have that dynamic similar to what you have on the large enterprise side.\nAlexander Blostein: Okay. Great. For my second, maybe I'll ask a less question. Can we talk just about cash. I think you guys gave the ICA yield of 320 for second quarter, but maybe just an update on where cash stands today in the composition. And also just around the philosophy you guys kind of starting on this journey of putting extensions in a couple of years ago, you're north of 50% now. Clearly, the volatility in cash balances has been something we have to live with for the last six to nine months. So as the environment continues to be sort of uncertain, do you guys anticipate to continue to extend and add more to big balances, or are you finding itself in a pretty good place here?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Alex, I think on April, and I'll give some color on cash balances and maybe just how we're seeing organic growth pull through in April as well. And I think when you look at cash on both of those things as a reminder, which I'm sure you know, but the -- I'll remind anyways, there's 2 key seasonal factors for April that will hit first and first and foremost is the tax impact right? It's tax month annual taxes for our clients usually impact cash as well as NNA by about $1.5 billion. And then in addition, given it's month 1 of the quarter, advisory fees primarily come out in that first month as well, which is around $1 billion. So those 2 seasonal factors would reduce cash by around $2.5 billion, everything else being equal. Then in addition to that, I think we've continued to see strong levels of investor engagement, but the pace of cash balance declines has continued to moderate. So when you look at the incremental decline in April, beyond those seasonal factors, it's about $800 million. So if you look at the first 4 months of this year, the cash balance declines really peaked in January and have moderated each month since. And when you take those seasonal factors into account, the April decline is the smallest decline so far this year. So you put all that together, that it's cash sweep balances just above around $51 billion where we sit today. On your point on fixing out the ICA balances, I think you -- I think the premise of the question summarized it well. We've got a target range of 50% to 75% with the $3 billion that we did put on this quarter. We're now within that range of 55%. And I think I like where we are. I think we feel well positioned. And of course, we'll monitor the environment from here. And if things evolve where we think it makes sense to put on more fixed the environment there has gotten quite constructive, and we feel good about our ability to do that if it makes sense. But where we sit today in this market, I think we feel well positioned where we are.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.\nJeff Schmitt: Just another one on the cash balances. So I think they're around 4.6% of client assets in the quarter. I understand you were saying that the pace kind of slowed, but appears to be driven by really strong sort of buy-sell activity. Are we approaching a level that you think even if the markets remain strong, it won't move below? Like I think you bottomed at 4.3% in 2019. Is that sort of a good support level?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I think a few things. I think the headline answer is yes from a support level. I think the best -- the thing that we look at here, which I think you were referencing is really history is the best guy here and getting at, is there a natural amount of cash that sits in an account to manage it and to do things like facilitate rebalancing, facilitate bang advisory fees, customer withdrawals, all so you don't see an adviser not forced to make a trade that they would otherwise not make a trade to facilitate those things. So when you look at our history, as you highlighted, when we've gotten to a place where advisers have their clients fully deployed into the marketplace, which has happened several times in our history, usually see it get down to that around 4% level. So history tells us that's the zone. And we're not seeing anything in this environment that causes us to think anything different.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then on core organic growth, I think you guided into the mid- to low teens kind of reiterated that view. What does that assume on interest rates? And would that change, I guess, if the Fed pause highest cutting in the back half of the year. How variable, I guess, is that assumption?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Well, I think as I commented on the prepared remarks, right, we have prepared our spending plans to build throughout the year. So if we think there is a reason to pause or adjust, we certainly have that ability. I think we'd be very deliberate about that. I think the investments that we're making, we think, drive long-term value of the firm. We've got our balance sheet positioned quite well to be able to do that. But if we do get an environment where the investments don't make sense or it does mean we need to pause we would, but I think sitting here today, I think we still feel quite comfortable that the 12% to 15% this year makes sense given the investments that we're making and the results that we think that will follow.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW.\nKyle Voigt: A couple of follow-ups for me. The first is on Alex's RIA question. I believe CG was previously using TDA for custody and with the Schwab and Ameritrade integration happening over the next year, I think, primarily in Q3. Just wondering, are you viewing that migration as a potential catalyst for putting more RIA assets in motion, and are you targeting that as an opportunity to continue to have success in that channel.\nDan Arnold: Much like we mentioned with regard to our traditional markets, that is certainly a change in the marketplace. It could be a catalyst for advisers looking different options and alternatives. And certainly, we believe that, that is a contributor to ongoing potential demand as not only we leave up to that transition, but even post that transition. I think in terms of step function change and significant change management efforts, sometimes on the other side of those, the always look what poser would have expected a desire and wanted. And so I think that opportunity that extends both before the transition and potentially after relative to the potential opportunity set. And I think what we're trying to do is just build a capable and feeling alternative that will structurally be attractive and create great opportunities for the advisers to see on our platform. To the extent we can do that, I think that differentiated value with the willingness and need to potentially look around at other options creates an interesting opportunity. That's what we're trying to play in.\nKyle Voigt: Great. And then a second follow-up is on the ICA. On the fixed rate side, I think a lot of the demand generally comes from larger banks that may have seen deposit inflows through the recent banking crisis. But in terms of that demand, I think you just noted that there were very constructive trends actually there. I guess, can you just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of how constructive those trends are and maybe quantifying that?\nMatthew Audette: Sure. At a headline level, I think that the appetite of the demand for ICA balances overall, whether it be fixed or floating, is well in excess of what we have to deploy, right? So I think when we our balances were able to deploy on both sides. I think on the fixed rate side, we're just now positioned where we want to be, and we're able to do that during the quarter. I think maybe to put some data behind it and where you could probably see it move in the marketplace itself is really on the variable rate side. And I think that when we're placing those deposits, we're starting -- if you look in the current quarter or the current market, those are now being placed at Fed funds plus 15 to 25 basis points. That was about a spread of 10 to 15 last quarter and compares to kind of flat to negative during the ended. So maybe that's probably the best place to focus on where you can see that demand for these deposits really show [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Michael Cyprus of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprus: Maybe we could circle back to brokerage M&A strength there, quite robust, 5.5% or so organic annualized. It's up meaningfully from a year ago. So I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on what's driving the strength there on the brokerage side and how you think about the persistency of that?\nDan Arnold: Let me take that. There's a couple of maybe primary drivers. As you say, you\u2019d see some growth year-on-year of revision that is compared to basis. And I think one of the drivers would be we're in a rate environment that we hadn't seen for 15, 16, 17 years. And in some cases, advisers opportunity to serve their clients to meet their needs in this rate environment leads to products that have maybe a utilization that is more appealing or easier to use as appropriate structure than an advisory. So, you see some of that from way to say that, that might be familiar to or some type of bond treasury, et cetera; the other thing that I think that you see driving that growth is also the -- some of the mix in these larger enterprise wins that we've had. They have a higher mix of brokerage than advisory. And certainly different than our typical mix of roughly 52%, 53% advisory. So, when we transition those folks in, obviously, that has a shorter-term influence in the mix we see that as an opportunity. Once they get to our platform, it's a much more appealing and robust advisory platform that has more interest in pricing to the end client. We do see those as opportunities for them as a list to shift their mix over time more towards advisory. But that's what's causing that -- those are the primary drivers that you're on the ship.\nMichael Cyprus: Great. Very helpful. And then just as a follow-up question. If we look at the gross profit ROA prior to the client cash, that also showed a very nice improvement year-on-year. It has been pretty steady in this 19 to 20 basis point range for some time. So I guess what do you see as some of the biggest opportunities to expand that over time, the gross profit ROA prior to client cash? What might be the 2 to 3 biggest drivers of expansion over the next couple of years, where do you see some potential partial offsets? And ultimately, what level do you think this could ultimately achieve?\nMatthew Audette: Yes, Michael. I mean, I think what I\u2019d emphasize is really the overall growth opportunities that we have for gross profit itself, right, things that we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this call, but our overall organic growth bringing in and recruiting larger advisers, the enterprise channel, which drives gross profit growth, but actually has a lower gross profit ROA. Like all of those things adding in our service and fee revenues and services group. Those things all drive growth there. And I think the key thing I would highlight from an ROA standpoint is as we become a larger and more diversified firm for both offerings and revenue drivers, they\u2019re just not all asset driven, especially in that service and fee revenue side, the growth that we\u2019ve had in the large enterprise channel will show up as lower gross profit ROA, even though we\u2019re serving and supporting those clients in a way that can drive compelling margin. So, I think it's less about the ROA from a basis point standpoint, it's really about the key drivers of our model that can drive a gross profit growth over time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Matt, I would love to circle back to the comments that you made about thinking that the prior level of cash as a percent of client assets would work as a trough this cycle. We've seen other firms, you laid out a few of the reasons for that, the need to have advisers catching the dividends and need for some base line of cash. But we've seen in other wealth management firms that have very similar business models, cash as a percentage of client assets go below prior cycle trough. So, I guess I'm just curious as to what gives you the confidence that, that trough is going to hold rather than a simple understanding that we're going to hire for longer, and therefore, prior trends might end up just being a bit different here and that fair too?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Well, I think, Brennan, there's always scenarios where things can play out differently. But I think from our standpoint, history is the best guy, right? And I think from our business model, which I know you've -- you've heard us talk through a bunch, but the cash balances as a starting point are relatively small and they are transactional or operational in nature. We've got a long-term average of around 5% or $7,000 per account. And when you look at that history, the primary factor that has moved those balances up and down is really based on the markets and where, and how advisers have their clients deployed. And to your point on when that -- when those balances come down, it's typically come down to that 4%. We've seen it several times, most recently in 2021 if the market's really recovered post the onset of the pandemic. So that's what we're looking at. And I think it's a combination of the size of the balances and the history that we've seen.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. All right. That's fair. And just a ticky-tack one to follow-up. Yield on the money market sweeps has sort of seemed to compress a bit from where it was about a year ago, I had always thought of those as more or less fixed. Is there some sort of mix dynamic that's happening where something that's causing that to compress? And how should we be thinking about that going forward? I know it's a small impact. Just kind of curious.\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I think -- well, in recent periods, it's come up a little bit. You're referring to perhaps a few years ago, is that what you're looking at?\nBrennan Hawken: No. The average yield in basis points on the money market sweep, it was 30. This quarter, it was 32 the prior quarter and then 38, in the third quarter...\nMatthew Audette: Yes. I just -- okay. So I'd put all those in a relatively similar zone not moving around a lot. Whenever you do see movement there, it's more about the mix is there a different firms or different paths. There's nothing from a pricing standpoint going on there. And as you said, the balances there are really small. So it's usually a mix.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we saw that annuity sales were up a lot. I think commissions were up 52% year-on-year. I'm curious white annuities are the clients buying? And have you seen an increase in surrenders of older annuities, just given the wide gap between where count rates are compared to where annuities were offered over the last decade.\nDan Arnold: Yes. I think the short answer to your question is what I said earlier that in this rate environment that we haven't seen for an extended period of time, there's an opportunity to use fixed annuities as a way to help people with their desires around yield or yield that leads to lifetime income and that opportunity has largely been muted for an extended period of time. And so because of that, it's not surrenders or exchanges from prior annuities, I think you would have seen that coming are being forced to come out of variable annuities that were set up and created for a different focus. And so this is typically new money that has opportunity to find higher yields with the pent-up demand for those higher yields that are, I think, well positioned and suited to support their long-term income needs in retirement. So that's the primary driver of that.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And just 1 question on your advisory relationships. But what percentage of LPL advisers with advisory relationships, charge fees on total client AUA versus net client AUA after backing out client cash.\nDan Arnold: Yes. Well, so first of all, there's limits to the amount of cash that someone can hold for a period of time within an advisory account or they're required to either put that money to work or move those assets out of that advisory account. So that's your control relative to high amounts of cash inside advisory accounts. That said, their cash that they use inside of the account at a appropriate levels as we talked about before is part of the fee that is charged.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Cho of JPMorgan.\nMichael Cho: I just wanted to follow up on capital allocation again. I mean you mentioned for the leverage continues to tick lower, and you've got $4 billion of firepower. If you think about the inorganic bucket, just given the changing backdrop and across bacon banking and I realize you just said nothing kind of near-term changes from recruiting or partnerships. But are there any segments or channels that you might be focused on more when you think about organic just as a LPL spire power just continues to grow. And then just relatedly, just in terms of the new liquidity and succession offering, it looks like you're having some good success there with the growing pipeline. I mean can you just remind us how much capital you're looking to allocate there? And maybe just the capacity for a number of deals annually or a dollar amount. But just -- yes, if you can just provide an update there.\nMatthew Audette: Sure. I'll start with liquidity and succession. I mean I think that if you look at what we did in the quarter, I think it's a good guide and the opportunity here to focus here from a capital standpoint is it's relatively small, right? We're deploying capital, using disciplined return thresholds, which usually leads to purchase multiples in the 6 to 8x EBITDA zone. The size of the deals are usually relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million range. So it's less a big use of capital, and it's more about really the capability that we're that we've built there to help transition practices to the next generation, right? So that's the key for the offering. I think on your main -- I think on your first question, make sure we got it as far as the opportunity set in the interest in -- from an M&A standpoint. I mean I think when you just look at where we have participated as a company, it's across several channels, but anything that would really accelerate our strategy, whether it be in our advancing in our traditional markets, expanding into newer markets, so the employee channel is an example that we did. And if we can do so in a way that just matches our strategy, that we've got the operational capacity to do it really well and then it meets our disciplined financial hurdles. I think that's how we'd be interested from an M&A standpoint. Dan, anything you want to add to that?\nDan Arnold: We also look always at capabilities, the interesting capabilities that will accelerate our strategy and create a better opportunity with interesting returns versus building them ourselves or renting them. We are always open for spring that too. So that's just the only other element of M&A that I might.\nMichael Cho: And then just a quick follow-up on the G&A. I mean, now you talked about some flexibility throughout the year, just given how things kind of shake out in the big picture. But are there any certain projects or initiatives that you'd call out that again, you might call in terms of the accelerated investments where you may pause if the environment changes later in the year?\nMatthew Audette: Not particularly. I mean maybe just to emphasize the construct and how we build up to the 12% to 15%. I mean I think that from a prioritization standpoint, we're investing first and foremost to support the core business. right? And each of those categories is about a 4% to 5% growth in the year. The second category is really about expanding our markets and scaling our new services. And then that third category is really being opportunistic given the environment to accelerate components of the strategy. So if we are pulling back, it would be more in that it would be first in that third category, which is less about a specific initiative and more about -- we're just doing some things that we would have otherwise have waited until 2024 over and beyond.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Bill Katz of Credit Suisse.\nBill Katz: Just coming back to the opportunity to sort of picks up versus flow. So it sounds like the 55% is about where you want to be. And sort understand that you've done a great job of managing through the rate cycle in the past. But to play devil's advocate for a moment, if you look at the forward curve, and its point is pretty sharp production, if you will. And you think that the sorting is sort of coming to a conclusion and the cash balances are starting to stabilize, why not try and fix out a bit more just to reduce some of the risk to earnings in '24 and '25?\nMatthew Audette: Yes, Bill I think when we form that target range of 50% to 75%, I mean, it was contemplated that would be the range we'd want to be in a range of interest rate environment. And it's not about being clear going on rates and picking exactly when and how and what percentage to do. It's about increasing the stability of our earnings. And I think we like where we're positioned in that range I'm not saying we're going to -- we're going to sit there forever. That's how we feel today if the environment changes or the dynamic changes, we'll adjust. But I think we really like where we're positioned right now.\nBill Katz: Okay. That's helpful. And then just coming back to capital for a moment. Thank you for the guidance on buyback into a new quarter. But if I take that and your dividend, it looks like the payout ratio on sort of consensus numbers for the quarter, plus or minus some updates from today is almost 80%, 90%. And when I look at your corporate cash, that number ex the $200 million bogey that you normally like to keep handy leaves very little incremental liquidity. So as you think about inorganic opportunities, liquidity and succession, and other use of cash. How do you think about the interplay between free cash flow deployment and balance sheet leverage, particularly given the macro backdrop?\nMatthew Audette: Yes. Well, I think the key thing there, Bill, is we'll manage liquidity based on our leverage ratio, right? So we're below the low end of our target range of 1.5 to 2.5. So we think about liquidity capacity across all three areas, right, investing for organic growth, M&A and returning capital to shareholders. I think we feel well positioned we're at that. We're below the low end of that range. So that's where we manage that and we feel good where we are.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dan for closing remarks.\nDan Arnold: Thanks. And I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We certainly appreciate your investment in time. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2023, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the backdrop of market uncertainty, our business performed well as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. In recent years, we've invested in capabilities, technology and service to enhance the experience of advisers, enterprises and their clients. At the same time, we've maintained a strong balance sheet with significant corporate liquidity and low leverage, positioning us to support our advisers and clients in a range of macro environments. This is most recently recognized by S&P, who upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, establishing us as an investment-grade credit with both our rating agencies. By leveraging the investments in our platform and our financial strength, we continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets. Closed two strategic acquisitions, continued our momentum with our liquidity and succession capability and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank, in Bank of the West in the second half of the year. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record adjusted earnings per share. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher [Indiscernible]. Total organic net new assets were $21 billion or a 7.5% annualized growth rate. Our Q1 recruited assets were $13 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a record first quarter of the year. This included $3 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation, the largest contribution since their launch a few years ago. Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues across our traditional independent and new models, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.49, the highest in our history. Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $1.02 billion, up $48 million or 5% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $215 million, up $43 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production. In Q1, our payout rate was 86.2%, down about 220 basis points from Q4 and largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year as well as a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 50 basis points realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5% primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production builds. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, flat to Q4 as the impact of higher short-term interest rates was offset by a sequential decline in balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $55 billion, down $10 billion, driven by record net buying of $37 million. Within our ICA portfolio, we added $3 billion of new fixed rate contracts, bringing our fixed rate balances to roughly 55% of the ICA portfolio within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 320 basis points in the quarter, up 29 basis points from Q4, primarily due to the increases in short-term rates. As for Q2, based on where interest rates are today and what we've seen with client cash balances so far in April, we expect our ICA yield to remain unchanged at approximately 320 basis. As the full quarter benefit of the Q1 rate hikes is offset by the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service fee revenue, it was $119 million in Q1, down $1 million from Q4, primarily driven by lower conference revenues, offset by seasonal increases in IRA. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue. It was $49 million, up $2 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect a seasonal decline of a couple of million dollars. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $326 million in Q1. For the full year 2023, we continue to promotional expense to increase to a range of $105 million to $110 million due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboarding as we prepare for Commerce Bank and Bank of the West to join us in the second half of this year. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $18 million in Q1, up from $12 million in Q4. In Q2, we expect a similar level of expense as the majority of our grants occur in the first 2 quarters of the year. Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $56 million in Q1, up $2 million sequentially, and we expect it to increase to approximately $60 million next quarter. Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $234 million, down $225 million from Q4 as we closed on 2 acquisitions during the quarter. Our leverage ratio was 1.3x, down from 1.4x in Q4, driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q1, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organically. On traditional M&A, we closed on 2 acquisitions for approximately $150 million. Within our liquidity and succession offering, we closed 7 deals for around $100 million, and we continue to have a solid pace. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $275 million in Q1. We plan to further increase share repurchases in Q2 to approximately $300 million. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation point. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes. I know you said for me, Steven, I think Dan is chomping up a bit on this figure. And then Alexander, on the economics, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the enterprise channel or the large financial institutions, where on the RIA side, it would typically have a lower gross profit ROA, but the cost and specifically, the acquisition costs are also lower. So I will underwrite returns. So you get to a bottom line margin and economics that are compelling and similar to the rest of the business, but you have that dynamic similar to what you have on the large enterprise side. Yes. Alex, I think on April, and I'll give some color on cash balances and maybe just how we're seeing organic growth pull through in April as well. And I think when you look at cash on both of those things as a reminder, which I'm sure you know, but the -- I'll remind anyways, there's 2 key seasonal factors for April that will hit first and first and foremost is the tax impact right? It's tax month annual taxes for our clients usually impact cash as well as NNA by about $1.5 billion. And then in addition, given it's month 1 of the quarter, advisory fees primarily come out in that first month as well, which is around $1 billion. So those 2 seasonal factors would reduce cash by around $2.5 billion, everything else being equal. Then in addition to that, I think we've continued to see strong levels of investor engagement, but the pace of cash balance declines has continued to moderate. So when you look at the incremental decline in April, beyond those seasonal factors, it's about $800 million. So if you look at the first 4 months of this year, the cash balance declines really peaked in January and have moderated each month since. And when you take those seasonal factors into account, the April decline is the smallest decline so far this year. So you put all that together, that it's cash sweep balances just above around $51 billion where we sit today. On your point on fixing out the ICA balances, I think you -- I think the premise of the question summarized it well. We've got a target range of 50% to 75% with the $3 billion that we did put on this quarter. We're now within that range of 55%. And I think I like where we are. I think we feel well positioned. And of course, we'll monitor the environment from here. And if things evolve where we think it makes sense to put on more fixed the environment there has gotten quite constructive, and we feel good about our ability to do that if it makes sense. But where we sit today in this market, I think we feel well positioned where we are. Yes. I think a few things. I think the headline answer is yes from a support level. I think the best -- the thing that we look at here, which I think you were referencing is really history is the best guy here and getting at, is there a natural amount of cash that sits in an account to manage it and to do things like facilitate rebalancing, facilitate bang advisory fees, customer withdrawals, all so you don't see an adviser not forced to make a trade that they would otherwise not make a trade to facilitate those things. So when you look at our history, as you highlighted, when we've gotten to a place where advisers have their clients fully deployed into the marketplace, which has happened several times in our history, usually see it get down to that around 4% level. So history tells us that's the zone. And we're not seeing anything in this environment that causes us to think anything different. Yes. Well, I think as I commented on the prepared remarks, right, we have prepared our spending plans to build throughout the year. So if we think there is a reason to pause or adjust, we certainly have that ability. I think we'd be very deliberate about that. I think the investments that we're making, we think, drive long-term value of the firm. We've got our balance sheet positioned quite well to be able to do that. But if we do get an environment where the investments don't make sense or it does mean we need to pause we would, but I think sitting here today, I think we still feel quite comfortable that the 12% to 15% this year makes sense given the investments that we're making and the results that we think that will follow. Sure. At a headline level, I think that the appetite of the demand for ICA balances overall, whether it be fixed or floating, is well in excess of what we have to deploy, right? So I think when we our balances were able to deploy on both sides. I think on the fixed rate side, we're just now positioned where we want to be, and we're able to do that during the quarter. I think maybe to put some data behind it and where you could probably see it move in the marketplace itself is really on the variable rate side. And I think that when we're placing those deposits, we're starting -- if you look in the current quarter or the current market, those are now being placed at Fed funds plus 15 to 25 basis points. That was about a spread of 10 to 15 last quarter and compares to kind of flat to negative during the ended. So maybe that's probably the best place to focus on where you can see that demand for these deposits really show [Indiscernible]. Yes, Michael. I mean, I think what I'd emphasize is really the overall growth opportunities that we have for gross profit itself, right, things that we've talked a lot about on this call, but our overall organic growth bringing in and recruiting larger advisers, the enterprise channel, which drives gross profit growth, but actually has a lower gross profit ROA.

So, I think it's less about the ROA from a basis point standpoint, it's really about the key drivers of our model that can drive a gross profit growth over time. Yes. Well, I think, Brennan, there's always scenarios where things can play out differently. But I think from our standpoint, history is the best guy, right? And I think from our business model, which I know you've -- you've heard us talk through a bunch, but the cash balances as a starting point are relatively small and they are transactional or operational in nature. We've got a long-term average of around 5% or $7,000 per account. And when you look at that history, the primary factor that has moved those balances up and down is really based on the markets and where, and how advisers have their clients deployed. And to your point on when that -- when those balances come down, it's typically come down to that 4%. We've seen it several times, most recently in 2021 if the market's really recovered post the onset of the pandemic. So that's what we're looking at. And I think it's a combination of the size of the balances and the history that we've seen. Yes. I think -- well, in recent periods, it's come up a little bit. You're referring to perhaps a few years ago, is that what you're looking at? Yes. I just -- okay. So I'd put all those in a relatively similar zone not moving around a lot. Whenever you do see movement there, it's more about the mix is there a different firms or different paths. There's nothing from a pricing standpoint going on there. And as you said, the balances there are really small. So it's usually a mix. Sure. I'll start with liquidity and succession. I mean I think that if you look at what we did in the quarter, I think it's a good guide and the opportunity here to focus here from a capital standpoint is it's relatively small, right? We're deploying capital, using disciplined return thresholds, which usually leads to purchase multiples in the 6 to 8x EBITDA zone. The size of the deals are usually relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million range. So it's less a big use of capital, and it's more about really the capability that we're that we've built there to help transition practices to the next generation, right? So that's the key for the offering. I think on your main -- I think on your first question, make sure we got it as far as the opportunity set in the interest in -- from an M&A standpoint. I mean I think when you just look at where we have participated as a company, it's across several channels, but anything that would really accelerate our strategy, whether it be in our advancing in our traditional markets, expanding into newer markets, so the employee channel is an example that we did. And if we can do so in a way that just matches our strategy, that we've got the operational capacity to do it really well and then it meets our disciplined financial hurdles. I think that's how we'd be interested from an M&A standpoint. Dan, anything you want to add to that? Not particularly.

I mean I think that from a prioritization standpoint, we're investing first and foremost to support the core business. right? And each of those categories is about a 4% to 5% growth in the year. The second category is really about expanding our markets and scaling our new services.

So if we are pulling back, it would be more in that it would be first in that third category, which is less about a specific initiative and more about -- we're just doing some things that we would have otherwise have waited until 2024 over and beyond. Yes, Bill I think when we form that target range of 50% to 75%, I mean, it was contemplated that would be the range we'd want to be in a range of interest rate environment. And it's not about being clear going on rates and picking exactly when and how and what percentage to do. It's about increasing the stability of our earnings.

            "content": "Thank you, Latania, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to help their clients navigate through market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and collectively helped millions of Americans continue to pursue their financial goals and aspirations. We thank them for the important work and remain focused on our mission taking care of our advisers, they can take care of their clients. Now as we look at the marketplace, we continue to experience the growing appeal of our model due to the combination of our robust and future risk platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model and capacity and commitment to invest. As a result, we continue to make solid progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the adviser-mediated market. In that spirit, we will continue to focus on helping advisers and enterprises, solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serving as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity margins. With respect to organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $21 billion, representing 7.5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $99 billion, representing approximately a 9% organic growth rate. Recruited assets were $13 billion in Q1, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to $85 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused in serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing funds. A combination that drove a sequential improvement in same-store sales in fuel, this increase occurred across all of our affiliation models led by solid growth in our enterprise team. With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations company. As a result, asset retention for the first quarter was approximately 99% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.49 of adjusted EPS, which is more than double our level from a year ago. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is -- on the leader across the adviser center market, which for us is being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business. Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers, deliver personalized advice and planning experience and at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisers in their efforts to the extraordinary business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. As we look ahead, we continue to see both the growing demand for advice and increasing the appeal of receiving that advice through a financial profession, and we believe that our strategy positions us well to capitalize on these key structural trends. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around two primary categories, horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 30,000 advisers in the marketplace. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities to solve for a broader spectrum of adviser means and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value. Now while our strategy has not changed, we will use the framework of horizontal expansion and vertical integration to review our strategic agility. This structure is an evolution of our strategic plays framework, and you can see how the strategic plays map to this new orientation within our investor presentation. With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisers and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation models, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and clients. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation models. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth reaching a new first quarter high of approximately $9 billion in assets. In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $3 billion in assets in Q1. In each of these models, we continue to realize growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contribution to our organic growth. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q2 for both our traditional markets and our new affiliation models. And with respect to large enterprises, today, we announced that BMO will onboard the Wealth Management business of Bank of the West to our Enterprise platform. In addition, we continue to prepare to onboard commerce. Collectively, these two deals will add approximately $11 billion of brokerage and advisory assets in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we continue to build our pipeline as demand for our model growth. Now in Q1, we also continue to have success in our traditional banking credit unit space, adding approximately $1 billion of accreted assets from this change. Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run driving business. This part of our strategy is helping advisers deliver their differentiated wisdom insight and advice wrapped in an easily accessible and highly personalized experience for the client. In that spirit, this quarter, we continued to enhance our adviser's value proposition through their funds. By introducing new account aggregation capabilities to help advisers consider their clients' holistic financial picture, by enriching the end client digital portal through the expansion of customizable self-service capabilities and by evolving our research offerings to include increased market commentary, delivered how and where it works best for the adviser. Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of solid demand in Q1, the number of advisers utilizing our service group continued to increase. And we ended the quarter at over 3,300 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year. Now as we work with advisers to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services such as our partial book sales solution, where we provide the flexibility for advisers to sell us their smaller accounts with clients that don't necessarily fit their practice, thus creating more capacity for them to focus on managing and growing their business more robust. This service has been received well, and we are seeing solid early momentum, a growing pipeline of demand. Now at the same time, we're seeing good success with our set of services that help solve the industry-wide challenge of up to 1/3 of advisers retiring over the next decade. In that spirit, over the past year, we've facilitated approximately 150 acquisitions among advisers through our M&A solutions program. And since launching our liquidity and succession capability in Q4, we have completed more than 10 of these deals with LPL advisers and have growing interest, both inside and outside of the LPL business. In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. No, look, Steve, when you have circumstances of displacement in the marketplace as you were calling out, that can create challenges and/or opportunities and circle through some of the bank failures in Q1. We think back to 2020 with the pandemic, a much more significant impact from that. I think in the case of the recent bank failures, we didn't necessarily see this disruption creating short-term opportunity because it was very short-lived and the impact somewhat muted. That said, I think at times like this, it does reinforce maybe some of the really important elements of this model. So think about it this way, the value of human center port, which creates opportunity for advisers as they are providing guidance and folks need it most in times of uncertainty. It certainly helps reinforce the deal of us as a strategic partner to advisers given our strength and scale and robust capabilities, we sort of end up being even a quality. And then finally, I think right to your question or the point of your question, it does reinforce our value proposition for enterprises and in particular banks that type of disruption may be a catalyst for exploring different strategic options or alternatives for different business lines, as an example, wealth management. And I think that certainly would create incremental demand as we go forward. Finally, our capital light model allows us to play offense and continue to invest back in the platform in order to enhance and further differentiate our reach and others perhaps can't do that in these disruptive markets are displaced a month. So I think we didn't see necessarily opportunity in the short run. I think it does reinforce the attributes of this model and it's quite helpful to our long-term growth and our positioning in the marketplace where we can kind of turn this change in the market into unity across most disruptive sort of marketplace changes. So I hope that helps. Yes. Well, look, I mean, if we look just glance Q1 as perhaps jumping off to your question, Steven, you see the traditional recruiting markets in a solid place for us with $9 billion in assets. And that channel continues to continuously produce solid results and continues to increase over time as differentiation of our model and our capabilities creates a real appealing alternative to these advisers. And quite frankly, the flexibility in our different affiliation models gives them different sets of sort of problems or challenges to potentially solve for by moving to our platform that they're in a place where they're trying to evolve their practice depending where they are in the life cycle of their model. So we certainly think that just as a baseline, we continue to see that part of the market strengthening and its opportunity from a recruiting standpoint. As you look forward to your point around other changes that players in the marketplace and the independent space may be contemplating or considering that certainly would take the lower baseline of churn we've seen over the last couple of years. And obviously create what should be a much bigger appetite we set any time we change in the marketplace and new model that is going to trigger or be a catalyst for advisers to consider their sets of opportunity relative to how they practice this business going forward. And so we do believe that if those things occur, that does create more churn in the marketplace. And we take our healing model. We take the growing capabilities out of our business development team to do a great job across all of these different affiliation models. And I think we addressed it play of and capitalize on that opportunity. So that's kind of how we see the traditional marketplace, both now and if things occur in the future, we'll be ready to is for those possibilities as they may [Indiscernible]. Thanks, Alex. This is Dan. I'll take the first part of that and then I'll flip it to Matt for kind of the part via that question. So first of all, yes, we had a nice win that you referenced a couple of weeks ago that we announced where the team did a great job of attracting CD Advisor Network, which is a new large RIA. And those apps will show up actually in second quarter or the current quarter that we're in. And look, I think this win does a couple of things. First and foremost, reinforces the strong work the team is doing to create a really compelling and differentiated solution in this part of the market. A great example perhaps of that is how we're using our services portfolio to give these RIAs access to differentiated tools and resources, they had always had availability to access to, which are really meant to help them better operate with businesses as they go forward once on our platform. So that's a great example of how we're building in what I might call a baseline of capability set and differentiation that can think is creating a more robust appeal for this part of the marketplace. I think if you click down specifically on CGA adviser network, and what were some of the attributes that may be attracted them, one, our very advisory-centered model I think coupled with innovative technology that they can create integrated workflows for driving efficiency in the practice and finally, in the flexibility of our solution to handle all of their assets in more integrated way on one platform. And so at a high level, those were probably some of the bigger attributes that they were attracted to. And so look, I think as we look forward, overall, we're really excited about the opportunity and the momentum is building in this model. We have a number of new clients that have joined us so far this year as we referenced in the recruiting in Q1. And certainly, there's more opportunities that are progressing in the pipeline. So we'll continue to invest in the capabilities here as we see this as a very attractive market to create that differentiated model and continue to contribute and accelerate growth. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on both that particular affiliation model and then specifically with CG Advisor Network. Much like we mentioned with regard to our traditional markets, that is certainly a change in the marketplace. It could be a catalyst for advisers looking different options and alternatives. And certainly, we believe that, that is a contributor to ongoing potential demand as not only we leave up to that transition, but even post that transition. I think in terms of step function change and significant change management efforts, sometimes on the other side of those, the always look what poser would have expected a desire and wanted. And so I think that opportunity that extends both before the transition and potentially after relative to the potential opportunity set. And I think what we're trying to do is just build a capable and feeling alternative that will structurally be attractive and create great opportunities for the advisers to see on our platform. To the extent we can do that, I think that differentiated value with the willingness and need to potentially look around at other options creates an interesting opportunity. That's what we're trying to play in. Let me take that. There's a couple of maybe primary drivers. As you say, you'd see some growth year-on-year of revision that is compared to basis. And I think one of the drivers would be we're in a rate environment that we hadn't seen for 15, 16, 17 years. And in some cases, advisers opportunity to serve their clients to meet their needs in this rate environment leads to products that have maybe a utilization that is more appealing or easier to use as appropriate structure than an advisory. So, you see some of that from way to say that, that might be familiar to or some type of bond treasury, et cetera; the other thing that I think that you see driving that growth is also the -- some of the mix in these larger enterprise wins that we've had. They have a higher mix of brokerage than advisory. And certainly different than our typical mix of roughly 52%, 53% advisory. So, when we transition those folks in, obviously, that has a shorter-term influence in the mix we see that as an opportunity. Once they get to our platform, it's a much more appealing and robust advisory platform that has more interest in pricing to the end client. We do see those as opportunities for them as a list to shift their mix over time more towards advisory. But that's what's causing that -- those are the primary drivers that you're on the ship. Yes. I think the short answer to your question is what I said earlier that in this rate environment that we haven't seen for an extended period of time, there's an opportunity to use fixed annuities as a way to help people with their desires around yield or yield that leads to lifetime income and that opportunity has largely been muted for an extended period of time. And so because of that, it's not surrenders or exchanges from prior annuities, I think you would have seen that coming are being forced to come out of variable annuities that were set up and created for a different focus. And so this is typically new money that has opportunity to find higher yields with the pent-up demand for those higher yields that are, I think, well positioned and suited to support their long-term income needs in retirement. So that's the primary driver of that. Yes. Well, so first of all, there's limits to the amount of cash that someone can hold for a period of time within an advisory account or they're required to either put that money to work or move those assets out of that advisory account. So that's your control relative to high amounts of cash inside advisory accounts. That said, their cash that they use inside of the account at a appropriate levels as we talked about before is part of the fee that is charged. We also look always at capabilities, the interesting capabilities that will accelerate our strategy and create a better opportunity with interesting returns versus building them ourselves or renting them. We are always open for spring that too. So that's just the only other element of M&A that I might. Thanks. And I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We certainly appreciate your investment in time. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for joining the Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for LPL Financial Holdings Inc. Joining the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Rich Steinmeier; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Rich and Matt will offer introductory remarks, and then the call will be open for questions. The company would like \u2013 would appreciate if analysts would limit themselves to one question and one follow-up each. The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website, investor.lpl.com.

For a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release, which can be found at investor.lpl.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steinmeier.\nRich Steinmeier: Thank you so much, operator. As a long-time listener and first-time caller, it\u2019s great to speak to everyone on today\u2019s call. For those that haven\u2019t met me, I\u2019m Rich Steinmeier, and it\u2019s my privilege to serve as LPL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. I joined the firm in 2018, following roughly a decade working in wealth management at a couple wirehouses, after having started my career in management consulting. I joined LPL with the mandate to accelerate our growth, and for the past six years, have worked closely with Matt and the rest of our leadership team, to set our strategic vision, and to build and execute on the plan to achieve that vision. Looking forward, our opportunity is clear to assert our leadership and shape both the advisor and institutional markets. Our focus is on creating the culture, strategy, and capabilities, to achieve sustainable outperformance by serving as an indispensable partner to our advisors and institutions, while delivering long-term value to shareholders. Okay. With introductions complete, let\u2019s turn to our results. In the quarter, total assets increased to a record $1.6 trillion, as we attracted organic net new assets of $27 billion, representing a 7% annualized growth rate. This was on pace with the past 12 months, during which we brought on nearly $100 billion of organic net new assets, representing approximately 8% growth. Our third quarter business results led to strong financial performance with an adjusted EPS of $4.16. Next, let\u2019s turn to our strategic plan and recent growth across our organic and inorganic initiatives. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, and provide unmatched flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us, and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisors\u2019 success throughout the lifecycle of their businesses. Doing this well, gives us a path to sustainable industry leadership, not just in the independent and institution markets, but across all of wealth management. In the third quarter, recruited assets were $26 billion, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to $87 billion, both of which represent records excluding periods when we onboarded large institutions. In our traditional independent market, recruiting reached a new quarterly high of approximately $23 billion in assets, improving on our already industry-leading capture rates of advisors in motion, while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth, Independent Employee, and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $3 billion in assets. And, as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace, and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities, will drive a sustained increase in their growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress within the large institution marketplace, where we advanced our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management businesses of Prudential Financial and Wintrust Financial. Collectively, these two partnerships will add approximately $76 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025. As a complement to our organic growth, earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions, welcoming their approximately 2,200 advisors, 160 institutions, and home office staff to the LPL family. The transaction is progressing well, and we are on track to meet our 80% retention target. As an aside, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to spend time with the Atria team over the past several months, and it is clearer than ever, that their advisor-centric orientation and high quality relationships with their advisors and institutions makes them a perfect fit for LPL. As for our broader business, asset retention remains industry leading at 98% over the last 12 months. This is a testament to our continued efforts to enhance the advisor experience, through the delivery of new capabilities and technology, and the evolution of our service and operations functions. In that spirit, I would be remiss not to call out a driving force behind our improving advisor experience, which is the ongoing operational transformation of the firm, spearheaded by Matt. Beyond his leadership as CFO, Matt has been at the helm of our Operations and Risk organizations, and in his expanded role as President, we\u2019ve consolidated additional responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of the firm under his purview, including customer service and supervision. It goes without saying that all of these critical functions are in very good hands. In closing, I want to reiterate how honored I am to lead this amazing firm, and to express my gratitude to our employees for the way they show up every day, to our advisors and institutions for their partnership, and to our shareholders for continuing to place their support and trust in LPL Financial. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt, who I would like to point out, dressed up as Johnny Cash for our company Halloween event last Friday, and I just wanted you to visualize that image as he dives into our results.\nMatt Audette: Are you telling me that was a Halloween event on Friday? That\u2019s what I normally wear, I figured the white onesie you were wearing was what you wore on Fridays.\nRich Steinmeier: The Men in Black theme.\nMatt Audette: Who knew? Well, thanks, Rich. I\u2019m glad to speak with everyone on today\u2019s call. I too feel exceedingly fortunate to serve this great firm in an expanded capacity, as LPL\u2019s President and CFO. To echo Rich\u2019s sentiment, we have built an advantaged position in the advisor-mediated market, and have a tremendous opportunity to extend our leadership. I look forward to partnering with Rich and continuing to enhance value for all of the stakeholders we serve. Turning to our results, in the third quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust. As a complement to our strong organic growth, we closed on the acquisition of Atria earlier this month. In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire The Investment Center, which we plan to onboard in the first half of 2025. So, as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our growing advisor base, while continuing to deliver an industry leading value proposition and drive organic growth. With respect to our third quarter business results, as Rich mentioned, it was another quarter of strong growth, with an annualized growth rate of approximately 7%, or 9% prior to the planned separation from misaligned large OSJs. On the recruiting front, Q3 recruited assets were $26 billion, which prior to large institutions, was a new quarterly high. Looking ahead to Q4, in addition to the expected onboarding of one of our largest institutional partners, Prudential, we continue to have a strong pipeline. However, I would note the natural seasonal headwinds to advisor movement during the back half of December related to FINRA\u2019s shut-down and the holidays. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline, led to adjusted EPS of $4.16. Gross profit was $1.128 billion, up $49 million sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $274 million, up $11 million from Q2. Our payout rate was 87.5%, up 20 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $372 million, up $11 million from Q2, driven by higher renewal rates on our fixed rate contracts. Overall client cash balances ended the quarter at $46 billion, up $2 billion sequentially, driven by organic growth. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances was roughly 65%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 332 basis points in Q3, up 14 basis points from Q2. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect the yields on our new fixed rate contracts to more than offset the impact of the two additional rate cuts expected by year-end. As a result, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points. As for Service and Fee revenue, it was $146 million in Q3, up $11 million from Q2. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large advisor conferences and expect seasonally lower IRA fees. However, given the acquisition of Atria earlier this month and the onboarding of Prudential later this quarter, we expect Service and Fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction revenue. It was $59 million, flat compared to Q2. As we look ahead to Q4, based on activity levels to-date, as well as the expected contribution from Atria and Prudential, we expect transaction revenue to increase by approximately $5 million sequentially. Now let\u2019s move on to Atria and Prudential. Starting with Atria, as mentioned, we closed on the transaction and continue to expect to onboard the advisors in mid-2025. Overall, the transaction is progressing well. We are on track to meet our estimate of 80% retention, but factoring in current asset levels, we now expect the run-rate EBITDA benefit to be approximately $150 million, up from our original estimate of $140 million. That said, in the near-term, given the timing of when synergies are realized, we anticipate our post-close, pre-conversion EBITDA to be roughly $40 million. Moving on to Prudential, we are on track to onboard them during Q4. As for Prudential\u2019s financial contribution, given current asset levels, which at the end of Q3 were approximately $60 billion, as well as current cash balances, we now expect approximately $70 million of run-rate EBITDA, up from our original $60 million estimate. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $359 million in Q3. Looking ahead, while there are variable costs associated with supporting our strong levels of organic growth, given our ongoing focus on efficiency, we are tightening our 2024 core G&A outlook to a range of $1.475 billion to $1.485 billion. Additionally, now that we have closed on our acquisition of Atria, and expect to onboard Prudential by the end of the year, we are including those costs in our overall core G&A outlook. As such, we expect Prudential and Atria to add $35 million to $40 million of core G&A in 2024. As a result, our new core G&A outlook range is $1.510 billion to $1.525 billion. Moving on to Q3 promotional expense. It was $176 million, up $28 million from Q2, primarily driven by conference spend as we hosted our annual Focus conference, as well as increased transition assistance resulting from our strong recruiting. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect promotional expense to decrease by approximately $10 million, driven by lower conference spend, partially offset by transition assistance related to Atria. As for regulatory expense, it was $25 million in Q3, up from Q2, as we recorded an $18 million charge related to a planned SEC settlement for anti-money laundering controls. Looking ahead, given the non-recurring nature of this item, we continue to expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $78 million in Q3, up $7 million sequentially. This included approximately $3 million of technology development related to Prudential. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in technology and recently, went live with two new internal data centers. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially. I would just note that we don\u2019t expect this level of sequential increase going forward. As for interest expense, it was $68 million in Q3, up $4 million sequentially, driven by the full quarter impact of the May debt issuance. Looking ahead to Q4, given revolver balances following the close of the Atria transaction, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $14 million sequentially. Regarding capital management, we ended Q3 with corporate cash of $708 million, up $24 million from Q2. As for our leverage ratio, at the end of Q3, it was 1.6 times. Looking ahead, consistent with our expectations, following the closing of the Atria transaction earlier this month, we anticipate our Q4 leverage ratio to be near the mid-point of our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5 times, and we expect corporate cash to return to more normalized levels, near our management target range of approximately $200 million. Moving on to capital deployment. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate: investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth, as well as M&A, where we allocated capital to our Liquidity & Succession solution, and on October 1, closed on the acquisition of Atria. Specific to share repurchases, a reminder that we paused buybacks following the announcement of the Atria acquisition. Now that we closed on the transaction, we plan to restart share repurchases in Q4, and anticipate buying back $100 million of our shares in the quarter. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well-positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Rich, Matt, congrats to both of you on new and expanded roles. That\u2019s good stuff. Rich, I was hoping we could start with you given this is your first opportunity to speak with a broader kind of investor and analyst group in your new role, obviously, the CEO of the firm, maybe spend a couple of minutes on the key priorities for the business over the next one to two years. What are the key areas of focus are likely for you to be? And is there going to be sort of any strategic change in direction for the business?\nRich Steinmeier: Great. Thank, Alex. Thanks for congratulating Matt and I on the expanded role. I actually really appreciate it. So as we jump in as a newly formed management committee into moving the business forward. I\u2019d say there are three top priorities that we\u2019re thinking about every day. The first are, that we have got to maintain the client centricity that this firm is known for, that is in serving our advisers, our institutions and allowing them to serve their end clients with distinction. It\u2019s what the firm was built on. And so for us, that is one of the top priorities as we advance making sure that we don\u2019t lose sight of what\u2019s made us special. Second, which is a slight pivot is to empower our employees. This is the ability to take the employees who sit at the all levels of this firm who are deeply connected with our clients and empower them to take the decisions to help those clients achieve success in however they may define it. And so for us, that\u2019s about putting in place a decision-making framework and a control framework that allows all of our employees to have the authority to make better decisions in support of our clients. It will allow us to feel nimbler and more direct in serving the clients. The third priority is driving operating leverage. We have had the privilege of high levels of growth extended over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in remarks, we have had Matt take over all of the operations, service, compliance and supervision to try to drive and continue to drive operating leverage and value for our shareholders. But one thing, Alex, that I would point out that is not going to change is actually our strategy. Our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser centered marketplace, and that outlook remains positive. And as a reminder, that\u2019s driven by our conviction in three structural and durable trends, the growing demand for investor advice, the appeal to receive that advice from a financial professional, and the attractiveness of the independent model. We actually sit in a privileged position in the marketplace. We have outsized gains in advisers that change firms and that growth has enabled us to fuel our strategy of investing back in our platform and our capabilities. I think that strategy should persist and it will give us the opportunity to outperform over the longer-term. And maybe if you\u2019ll allow me, just one final thought. It\u2019s been three weeks where I have spent time meeting with hundreds of our clients. And what I\u2019ve learned in those three weeks is that this firm is a very special place. In fact, the thing is our clients, actually, when I reach out to them, say, Rich, how can we help you? These relationships that we have with our clients have been built over years and decades. And in fact, those relationships are built on foundation of relationships, but it\u2019s not relationships with me as the CEO, its relationships with relationship managers, advisory consultants, branch managers, supervisory consultants, transition specialists. And what I\u2019ve seen in the last three weeks are those employees have stepped up in a major way. Our clients are echoing that back to us. And if you think about our ability to succeed in the future, it will be driven by our clients being the loudest advocates for our firm, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen. I give huge kudos to our employee base.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you for that perspective. Very helpful. Matt, I guess since you dressed up as Johnny Cash, let\u2019s talk about cash. You guys and the industry broadly put up really nice growth in cash balances for the first time in a while, obviously, much, much welcome development for you guys in the space. Maybe unpack a little bit what have been sort of the sources of growth and totally understand the hesitation of sort of calling the bottom on cash balances. We\u2019ve tried to do that before, and that hasn\u2019t played out yet. But are you starting to see a more durable kind of outlook on \u2013 just based on the \u2013 where recruited assets are and the outlook for growth on cash balance is starting to grow over time from these levels.\nMatt Audette: Yes, Alex. I think on your point of calling the bottom, it\u2019s always tough. But I think just to reiterate some things that we\u2019ve talked a fair bit about in the past that I think are relevant now as you just start to hone in on when you\u2019re looking at cash sweep, those are cash balances that are largely operational. So you\u2019re starting to get down to what is really the amount of cash necessary to do things like rebalancing, paying advisory fees, facilitating withdrawal, things of that nature. And where \u2013 when we look at that as a cash as a percent of AUM, right, that has been coming down. We\u2019ve stabilized the last couple of quarters and just under 3% zone. But even if you look at the few quarters leading up to that, a big part of the driver \u2013 the primary part of the driver was really the denominator, I mean the market is going up, so that percentage came down. So if you look at it just as cash balances on an average per account, they have stabilized for a few quarters at just over $5,000. So to your point, it\u2019s always tough to call a bottom. But I think when you look at where we are right now, with the amount of cash that\u2019s in there really is the cash necessary to manage accounts. So then I think you pivot to really what does our growth outlook look like because as you bring in new accounts, if those on average are $5,000, you can \u2013 you\u2019ve got strong organic growth like we do, and you do couple that with a stabilization, you can start to be in a place where you could see cash balances start growing again, right? So it\u2019s hard to promise that, but I think the dynamics that would lead to that are there, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out.\nAlex Blostein: Great. All right. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good afternoon, Matt, and welcome, Rich. Just echoing Alex\u2019s remarks, congrats to both of you on the new and expanded roles. Rich, maybe just starting with you, since you\u2019ve been the primary architect of the growth strategy, these last six years, I thought it might be helpful if you could lay out your either strategic vision or growth priorities, specifically for the institutional and private wealth channels just given those are much larger TAMs, you\u2019re increasing your share, but the penetration is still quite low. And what does that success just look like for you over the next five years across both of those channels?\nRich Steinmeier: Thanks, Steven. I will take those each in turn. So let\u2019s start with the institutional channel. So as you know, we\u2019ve had some nice success in the recent past, but maybe I\u2019d start this discussion a little bit earlier because while we\u2019ve had an acceleration certainly in our participation in the institutional channel in the last five years, this story starts decades ago, this firm has always served community banks, credit unions and built capabilities to actually serve them. And as we build those capabilities and committed to the growth in that channel, we started to attract really progressive firms, Old National Bank, South State, Webster, Simmons, and we grew our sophistication in the ability to serve larger institutions. As we did that, we made a concerted effort probably around 2020 to say there\u2019s a real opportunity inside the large bank channel. And that opportunity for us is because the demand of serving and delivering a wealth business which used to sit with lower thresholds to be able to participate, those were growing because of the expectations of regulatory changes of the needs to deliver an outstanding platform and the expectations of what end investors were requiring. And so we had a pivotal moment around 2021. When we had a leader in M&T choose us and that was probably one of the first times that a firm above $20 billion in wealth had chosen to partner with an outsourced firm. And at that point, it actually changed the dynamic in the marketplace from large firms being asked, why on earth would you outsource, to starting and ask the question of the leaders asking why aren\u2019t you considering outsourcing and partnering with a world-class partner. And that\u2019s not just the M&T, but it\u2019s the credibility of a Doris Meister and Matt McAfee, the leaders at that firm, and the position that they held in the marketplace where others actually really trusted their vision and trusted the decision that they made. So from there, we saw us beginning to snowball into the larger bank segment in a material way. And as a reminder, that\u2019s a $1 trillion market segment. And at this point, we\u2019ve built capabilities where we are clearly the leader in the ability to deliver a world-class wealth management program in partnership with a financial institution. And beyond our capabilities, what happens is in two weeks, we\u2019ll have a round table where you will see the leaders of the industry at the roundtable and they happen to be our clients. And what happens in that scenario is that they are feeding from each other, learning from each other, pushing us and pushing each other. And so there are dynamics there that allow us to extend our leadership in that market. In a similar way, we then realized there is an opportunity for us to integrate the data that sits inside of a product manufacturer and insurance firm with the wealth data that allowed us to have a distinctive offering in the marketplace. We began discussions and found a willing partner in Prudential. And as we progress those discussions with Prudential and built towards this solution that we\u2019ll deliver in the last quarter of this year, we then realized that we now also have a distinctive offering in that marketplace in the integration of two different types of experiences that being the insurance as well as the wealth. Instead of having folks having to swivel chair back and forth, they now have a world-class integrated platform with end investor capabilities. That is second to none. Again, taking Caroline Feeney and Brad Hearn, the leaders of the wealth business there, taking a big, bold step with us. And in fact, what that has led to is beginnings of conversations inside the marketplace around, I think, the pivot that M&T drove in the marketplace, which is not why on earth would you outsource, but why aren\u2019t you considering a partner to achieve the efficiency, the derisking and the platform capabilities that would come with being with a world-class leader. So we think we feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue to progress our momentum, not only in the bank segment but as well as in that product manufacturer and insurance segment. And as a reminder, that segment is $1.5 trillion market opportunity as well. So I think we\u2019re building momentum. It still feels like early days, and it feels great that we\u2019re a leader presenting an opportunity to continue to grow as the requirements of scale continue to increase in those markets. If I turn the page Steven, and talk about high net worth and private wealth, maybe I have to go backwards again to go forward here. But a couple of years ago, we identified that we wanted to expand our participation in the wealth management market. And we realized that our capabilities were really strong. And in fact, the independent movement and the offering that we could bring to market around independents was incredibly well regarded in the marketplace. But we needed to build more capabilities to allow folks to get to independent. And that began our journey to introducing our strategic wealth services, which is the supported 1099 model. Then we introduced our Linsco independent employee model, and now more recently, what we\u2019ve realized is as we built capabilities to support those more sophisticated advisers that are by and large coming out of the wires or other regional, we\u2019ve built capabilities that allowed us to progress into a private wealth market. And we\u2019ve been able to introduce in that market a unique offering because it brings the principles of independence and book ownership it brings higher payouts to the advisers, while also providing all of the capabilities expected in a private wealth offering, advanced planners, access to capital markets, partnership models to secure solutions for high net worth investors. And as you put that together, it feels like a second-to-none offering in the marketplace. Now there\u2019s a couple of things we\u2019ll have to build more capabilities around our alts capabilities, integrated banking capabilities and further progression inside of our advisory platforms, and we\u2019re on that journey. But as we progress those capabilities married with our learnings, what we\u2019ve seen is early momentum that we feel really good about. And so, so far, since we launched that offering November 3 a year ago, we\u2019ve had four teams joined serving over $2 billion in assets. And as we expand our participation in that market, that\u2019s a $5 trillion market opportunity that we see ourselves at the beginning of a trend and just like the Linsco offering and the strategic wealth offering that allowed us to penetrate wirehouse and regional advisers with greater distinction, we think that this is a distinctive offering that goes after those private wealth advisers and should lead us to sustained growth in this segment.\nSteven Chubak: Really helpful insight, Rich. Just a follow-up for Matt. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen a pretty meaningful decoupling between the share price and NNA, your stock currently trading at a pretty steep discount to wealth peers despite generating much stronger NNA and in a consistent fashion mind you. It clearly suggests the market is just not willing to capitalize that stronger organic flow momentum. I wanted to get your perspective just on what you believe the market is underappreciating first. And second, why not consider leaning more aggressively into buyback just to take advantage of this valuation disconnect that exists today?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Steven. I think there \u2013 we certainly view the stock as undervalued, maybe hitting the \u2013 leaning into buybacks first, which we are restarting as I covered in the prepared remarks, I think one of the really important things that I think we are unwavering on is having a strong balance sheet for many reasons. I think a lot of them are obvious, but maybe some of them are less obvious in that, if that is also a contributor to the driver of organic growth, right? When you look at the businesses that we serve and support being with a partner that\u2019s going to be able to withstand environments where interest rates go down or the equity markets go down, and not have to look inward and reduce their levels of investment like some other firms that they\u2019ve come from, that is a really important thing. So I think when we look at our capital allocation, it\u2019s all in a construct of being within that leverage target range. And then I think when you click down within that, we continue to focus on driving returns, which includes share repurchases I think the returns on organic growth are better. The returns on M&A have been better, but the returns on share repurchases are compelling. So I think we would anticipate allocating capital to all those areas. I think to the first part of your question, I think from a market disconnect standpoint, I think there certainly is one. It\u2019s tough to understand how and why other than I think our conviction on the investments we\u2019re making that are going to drive long-term value that when you\u2019re doing things like bringing on a Prudential and that certainly does require a lot of upfront investment, upfront capital, that not only is a compelling return for that particular opportunity that opens up a broader market. These are all things that are an example of things that just drive long-term value. And probably not the first time in the history of the markets where the long-term opportunity is perhaps underappreciated. Certainly not underappreciated by us, which is why we\u2019ve got the conviction to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. So hopefully, that helps.\nSteven Chubak: Well said, Matt. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks, Rich. Matt, good afternoon and congratulations on the well-deserved expanded roles. Maybe just one on liquidity and succession for you. Great to see your first of platform deal. Maybe you could just update us on the traction you\u2019re seeing and remind us how much capital you\u2019re deploying to this and anticipate deploying into this over the next 12 months relative to, say, the last 12 months? And more broadly, strategically, how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity set here unfolding as you look out over the next couple of years?\nRich Steinmeier: Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Rich. Thank you so much for the kind words at the beginning. I\u2019m going to start, and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Matt around the capital deployment. And so let\u2019s start with the momentum inside of liquidity and succession. I think you got to start with the background of how big is the opportunity. And so we think that over the next 10 years, we expect to see one-third of advisers retire in the industry. And as you look at the independent segment, which is the fastest-growing segment in the marketplace, there really wasn\u2019t a mature set of solutions to help those advisers retire. In fact, in the past, those solutions largely were seller financed moving from one adviser to the next, but the risk was often borne by the adviser who is selling the business. And so in 2022, with that backdrop, we came at this, I would say, from a different angle than many folks. We started \u2013 we had \u2013 in fact, it was driven by our existing clients asking us, please provide us a solution because we want to stay with LPL. We don\u2019t want to have to sell away and we don\u2019t want to lose control of our business. And in listening to those clients like we do on so many different things, we comprise an offering that, one, helps those advisers monetize their business at a fair market rate. Two, it identifies and supports the next generation of advisers, we call those the G2 advisers, where we will build a relationship with those advisers to help finance them in buying back that practice from the founder or the practitioner as it stands. And in fact, 70% of those transactions that we\u2019re involved in have an identified G2 adviser already in place inside of the practice. Three, we then move that business from that first generation to the second generation, but without changing the experience for the client, it\u2019s the same office it\u2019s the same brand. It\u2019s the same way that they deliver advice, maybe it\u2019s a planning-based orientation to advice. And so the clients actually feel continuity in that progression and not a disruptive move from one firm to the next. And then fourth, maybe oftentimes most important, those founders of those principles of the business, they want to see the legacy of their business protected. They\u2019re not in it for actually the top dollar. They want to see that what they built or maybe what their father or mother built continues into the next generation. And that\u2019s so important for them. And \u2013 so as we build that solution, which I will tell you, does not exist in the marketplace other than at this firm, we now see the proof in the pudding. Our advisers who have gone through and entered into a liquidity and succession agreement with us are some of the happiest advisers that we have at this firm. The NPSs are off the chart or Net Promoter Score is off the charts. And I got a tangible experience of this. We had our Focus conference not that long ago, and we hosted a happy hour with a number, probably 15 of those teams and advisers that had entered into that agreement with us. And I felt like the bell of the ball. I couldn\u2019t be \u2013 I was spun like a top because every one of them said, thank you so much for derisking my business. Thank you so much for getting it to the next generation. Thank you so much for not making me sell to another firm that is going to whitewash my business, change the way my clients are served, and shut my office down. And so that momentum we\u2019ve seen internally, we have our most outspoken advisers are our largest advisers and our most influential advisers and so many of them are already in partnership with us. And so I think you\u2019ll see a continuing momentum on that internal opportunity for liquidity and succession. And what that\u2019s led to, first, in the external marketplace was that advisers who we were in discussions with to recruit them learned of how strong this program was, and it began to influence advisers consideration of our firm not to necessarily go through a liquidity and succession event, but recognizing that this was a unique solution that would want them \u2013 that would be attractive to them to join our firm. And I\u2019ve been on so many HOVs with those large teams that are coming over specifically because they have optionality at some point to provide continuity into their staff and consistency into their clients. But then it went probably a step further, is obviously, we\u2019re trafficking in a lot of conversations with advisers at all stages of their development and their progression. And so as you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter, we\u2019ve begun to move into having direct liquidity and succession transactions with external advisers to our firm. We think that it works from two ways. One, primarily is attractive to join this firm because then they have the LNS solution, which is unique in the marketplace available for them when they want to move towards transitioning to the next generation. But two, we also do see, you can\u2019t look past that a third of advisers are going to retire in the next 10 years. That\u2019s not just at this firm. And with that offering, we think that it will be able to augment our way that we go to market in a way that will allow us to have an addressable market that is even larger than we have today. I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to think about \u2013 to talk about the use of capital.\nMatt Audette: Yes, Mike. I think of use of capital. I think on the external side, it\u2019s early, right? Kind of hard to have a sharp estimate on where that goes from a capital allocation standpoint other than to underscore what Rich said the opportunity set there is quite large. But it\u2019s all volume dependent. So I just go back to kind of the key metrics and that we use on these deals, we\u2019re typically during the $10 million to $20 million zone, if you look at those internal deals per deal, we\u2019re doing 6 to 8 times EBITDA is largely the zone that we land. We\u2019ve done about 40 so far and the purchase prices have kind of been in the middle of that zone, so call it, $0.5 billion. So that\u2019s probably a good way to think about going forward from here. And then I think external deals would just add on to that, probably at a lower multiple because you\u2019re getting not only \u2013 you\u2019re basically getting two things. You\u2019re getting the recruiting economics, which are typically at 3 to 4 times, and you\u2019re doing the L&S transaction, which is at 6% to 8%. So on average, there\u2019s probably a multiple that\u2019s a little bit lower. So than an internal. So hopefully, that helps guide you.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much. And just a follow-up question, coming back to one of your strategic priorities was to drive operating leverage. I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the steps you might take to drive operating leverage in the business, what we might see there? What sort of magnitude do you think is achievable over the next couple of years and what success might look like there?\nMatt Audette: Yes. I mean I think when you look at just the areas where we add costs, right, as we grow, it\u2019s a great insight to see where we can get more efficient and get more leverage and really drive down our cost to serve. So it\u2019s in the areas that have the largest headcount. And as Rich covered kind of the areas that I\u2019m largely responsible for now. And I think when you look at what we\u2019re doing there is you\u2019ve got a combination of investing in efficiencies, things like robotics, you\u2019ve got opportunities as we improve our technology, as we improve our capabilities, the reasons that advisers may need to call our service center would decline, which allows you to grow this business without adding more heads there. So there\u2019s just a host of areas, Mike, where the more that we invest in efficiencies, the more that we improve our technology, the more that we get deeper and deeper into our expertise in all these different areas, the things that we\u2019re driving costs will come down. So I think it\u2019s a classic just cost to serve opportunity set that really has allowed us, if you just look at this year and this quarter, where we\u2019re delivering on quite strong levels of growth, but we\u2019re \u2013 our core G&A guidance is really within the range of where we started the year. And the reason for that is our cost to serve is coming down. And I think that\u2019s the focus and the intent that we\u2019ll have going forward as well.\nRich Steinmeier: Hey Mike, it\u2019s Rich. I\u2019d love to add just one thing to that. One thing I wouldn\u2019t overlook in the construct of how we improve operating leverage is actually our organizational alignment. So the guy sitting across from me, who has demonstrated that he is one of the best CFOs in wealth management with an eye towards making sure he understands how the business is put together also now leads the largest components of cost for the firm. He understands how to responsibly deploy capital to build efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in our operating costs while doing that inside of that environment of being both the CFO and President. And so I think there\u2019s a lot of harmony in that evolved organizational alignment that should allow us to continue to make progress against that operating leverage.\nMatt Audette: I don\u2019t think anybody heard that, if you mind repeating it.\nRich Steinmeier: Yes, do it every day and twice on Sunday.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Rich, Matt, first just wanted to offer you both a congrats on the expanded roles.\nRich Steinmeier: Thank you.\nMatt Audette: Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My question is on free cash flow conversion, and I\u2019m looking at Page 15 of the release. We saw positive sequential growth and year-over-year growth in corporate cash balances, although the growth was smaller after backing out the excess cash at the regulated subs. Given the return of the buyback, how should we think about your cash and liquidity objectives at the company and the holdco? And really what metrics are you focused on?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Craig, I think when you look at the two big metrics that we\u2019ll focus on really is overall leverage, right? So 1.5x to 2.5x target range. I think we\u2019ll \u2013 between the mix of cash flow that we generate and deploy and the borrowings that we use, which I think is a more efficient use of capital than equity is really being in that range. And then allocating that capital to the areas that we\u2019ve talked through. So organic growth, M&A, share repurchases. I think maybe specifically on your point on cash itself, that was elevated the last couple of quarters as we did opportunistically go to market in May when the markets were quite good to raise the cash to get ready to close on Atria. So when you go into Q4, you should expect to see that cash level \u2013 that corporate cash level to come back down to where we typically operate, which is in that 200-plus zone, which is the amount of cash we typically like to keep around. But then you\u2019ll see leverage more in that \u2013 right in the middle of that range of kind of call it around 2x. So that\u2019s where we like to anchor. And then based on where we are from a leverage standpoint, just take that liquidity and apply it to our capital allocation framework like we always have.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you Matt. My follow-up is on your alternative investment offering. I was wondering if you could remind us what the offering looks like today between both private market strategies and drawdown funds and also semi-liquid vehicles? And do you have plans to expand this offering further, which could enhance your recruiting effort?\nRich Steinmeier: Hey Craig, it\u2019s Rich. I\u2019ll take that one. So let me start at the end of your question, which is do we intend to expand this platform further? The answer is yes. It goes to the journey that we\u2019ve been on, which is that we started to serve really exceptional independent advisers. We then expanded our total addressable market by being very intentional at looking at wire house and regional advisers. And as we began to have success into those wires and regionals, the demand to join our firm continue to increase, but some of our capabilities were short of the absolute need that those advisers may have been used to at the other firms. And so that would center on alts [ph], some of our banking capabilities. And as I mentioned, the further extension of our wealth management platform and specifically our UMA. Inside of alts, over the last year, we\u2019ve made significant progress in building towards a world-class platform. The first thing we did was expand our custodial and operational capabilities. And the second was then beginning the material expansion of our shelf of alts themselves. This is a multiyear effort. In fact, now we have over 20 folks working full time inside of the alts to go through diligence as well as to position to our adviser base to help them understand solutions and help them position them to their clients. In addition to those capabilities, specifically this year, we began a new \u2013 we\u2019ve deployed a new alternative investment order entry system which we launched in the second quarter with a pilot set of advisers and have gotten a lot of feedback on. And in fact, we have used that launch in the second quarter to build and enhance what we call AIOE, our Alternative Investment Order Entry system so that it is much more intuitive and have better capabilities in support of a broad deployment at the end of the fourth quarter. The feedback that we\u2019ve got from the advisers who went on the pilot has been incredibly positive. And as they\u2019ve learned into our expanded capabilities in response to their feedback, it\u2019s only gotten stronger. So we look forward over the next year to finalizing that build reflective of the needs of those advisers and continue to expand that breadth of product offerings to achieve not only the opportunity to support our existing advisers, but as you mentioned, make us more attractive inside of those high net worth oriented advisers that either sit as what we would call maybe high net worth dabblers inside of the wires and regionals or those that are inside of the private wealth channels themselves. That goes to a little bit of maybe one of the earlier questions that I was answering. So you\u2019re spot on. This is a capability that is important to us that we have made investments in and we\u2019ll continue to make investments in until it becomes a world-class capability for us.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Brown: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate all the background, Rich, on the institutional side of the business, and the momentum is clearly very strong there. Can you just speak to the constraints in growing in that channel? What is the kind of annual pace that you could tackle there when you\u2019re considering that $1.5 trillion opportunity. And as you onboard some of these bigger complex clients like Prudential, can that speed of onboarding begin to pick up?\nRich Steinmeier: Absolutely, Mike. Thank you for the question. I would note that Mike is the first person that has not congratulated you on your expanded role. So I also feel the same way you do, Mike. I think he should have just be a little more humble. So let\u2019s get into that question as well.\nMike Brown: There\u2019s still time I can congrats on [indiscernible] answer from you both.\nRich Steinmeier: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the constraints on the institutional segment. There\u2019s a couple of things. If you think about accelerating the pace in an institutional segment, one of the differences between an adviser segment in the institutional segment is that the sales and engagement process is quite a bit longer. If you think about our engagement with Prudential, we actually were in discussions for a couple of years before we got to contracting, which then led us to a pretty sizable build \u2013 to build those capabilities. Now the good news is for incremental initiatives or incremental partnerships that we would have for so many of them, we won\u2019t have that long build cycle because we will have built the capabilities certainly inside the product manufacturer segment. On the bank side, we\u2019re the leader in capabilities. And so that again, that\u2019s going to have a longer sales cycle. That\u2019s not going to look like years, it\u2019s going to look like probably a nine-month sales cycle, you\u2019re going to see an RFI and an RFP and they\u2019re going to go through decisioning and then you\u2019ve got contracting. And then you can think of anything between six months to 12 months as a time frame for which we\u2019re preparing to onboard that. And so what you\u2019ll get, Mike, is as you\u2019re building momentum, some of that you\u2019re not going to see in the short term is because as firms I specifically mentioned inside of the product manufacturer space, as they see through the Prudential transition and successful Prudential transition as they then raise their heads and start to get into an engagement process with us, you\u2019re going to have a pretty sizable lead time. And so that\u2019s one of the things you would see. Now you specifically asked about constraints so let\u2019s get back to constraint. A couple of years ago, as we would go through a major transition, we would think about having the capacity to do one a quarter. And I think that would have been a constraint at the time, and then we began to think about the ability to do one major transition a month. And I can tell you, in the last year or so, we started to feel that, that might be a constraint. And so we\u2019ve built the capabilities and the capacity and the sophistication of our onboarding, and that\u2019s probably a really important component that I didn\u2019t allude to earlier because we\u2019ve done so many of these large transition events, we\u2019ve invested pretty heavily in digitizing and automating those transitions themselves. And so when Matt was talking about driving that operating leverage up, part of that is ongoing, but part of it is actually reducing the cost and the friction actually get those large firms over in a large event, either an M&A event or a partnership event. And so as we\u2019ve gone through that, we have built the capacity now to handle multiple events inside of even a single month. We had that happen not that long ago. We had two events across a three-week period. and we did not miss a beat. And so we\u2019ve begun to take away the constraint around the ability to transition material events at a pace that feels a lot more accelerated than we would have had in the past. But probably one of the things, Mike, is I\u2019d probably lean more towards the first part of my answer, which is as firms see us as a more attractive offering. There\u2019s a lot of due diligence to go through. And in many cases, there\u2019s some custom build that has to go on. And so that back and forth, there\u2019s a lot of complex solutioning that our team is engaged with to understand their operating environment, especially in those larger firms. And that time frame is very hard to compress. You can compress the conversion, but it\u2019s harder to compress the sales cycle because of the complexity of so many of these really larger firms. I hope that helps.\nMike Brown: Yes. Yes. Very helpful. And then just for a follow-up, as you to build on the operating leverage comments. Just hoping to maybe get a little sneak peek on to 2025. The annual core G&A growth for 2024 was 7.5% to 8.5% prior to Pru and Atria. I\u2019m just trying to think through, is that perhaps the right range to consider for 2025? Or what\u2019s the puts and takes there, Matt?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Mike. We\u2019re in that planning process now. So we\u2019ll come back like we normally do in the year-end call and give that guidance. But I think that maybe the higher level things I would hit is one, just keep in mind, we\u2019ll have Pru and Atria for the full year effect of that in 2025. So if you kind of put that aside, I think and just reiterate what we talked about on this call, I think our focus will be continuing to invest to drive organic growth at the same time delivering that operating leverage. And I think \u2013 this year, I think, is a good example of those growth rates starting to come down and balance those two things versus 2022 and 2023, where we had more of an outsized investment. So we\u2019ll have that same perspective going into 2025, but we haven\u2019t landed those plans yet. It will be guided by the opportunities we see to invest and drive growth and by the opportunities we see to invest and deliver operating leverage and \u2013 but those principles be the thing that guides us.\nMike Brown: Okay, great. Thank you. And congrats to both of you.\nOperator: Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Rich Steinmeier for closing remarks.\nRich Steinmeier: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again in January. Have a great night, and have a safe and happy Halloween.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "Are you telling me that was a Halloween event on Friday? That's what I normally wear, I figured the white onesie you were wearing was what you wore on Fridays. Who knew? Well, thanks, Rich. I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. I too feel exceedingly fortunate to serve this great firm in an expanded capacity, as LPL's President and CFO. To echo Rich's sentiment, we have built an advantaged position in the advisor-mediated market, and have a tremendous opportunity to extend our leadership. I look forward to partnering with Rich and continuing to enhance value for all of the stakeholders we serve. Turning to our results, in the third quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust. As a complement to our strong organic growth, we closed on the acquisition of Atria earlier this month. In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire The Investment Center, which we plan to onboard in the first half of 2025. So, as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our growing advisor base, while continuing to deliver an industry leading value proposition and drive organic growth. With respect to our third quarter business results, as Rich mentioned, it was another quarter of strong growth, with an annualized growth rate of approximately 7%, or 9% prior to the planned separation from misaligned large OSJs. On the recruiting front, Q3 recruited assets were $26 billion, which prior to large institutions, was a new quarterly high. Looking ahead to Q4, in addition to the expected onboarding of one of our largest institutional partners, Prudential, we continue to have a strong pipeline. However, I would note the natural seasonal headwinds to advisor movement during the back half of December related to FINRA's shut-down and the holidays. As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline, led to adjusted EPS of $4.16. Gross profit was $1.128 billion, up $49 million sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $274 million, up $11 million from Q2. Our payout rate was 87.5%, up 20 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $372 million, up $11 million from Q2, driven by higher renewal rates on our fixed rate contracts. Overall client cash balances ended the quarter at $46 billion, up $2 billion sequentially, driven by organic growth. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances was roughly 65%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 332 basis points in Q3, up 14 basis points from Q2. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect the yields on our new fixed rate contracts to more than offset the impact of the two additional rate cuts expected by year-end. As a result, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points. As for Service and Fee revenue, it was $146 million in Q3, up $11 million from Q2. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large advisor conferences and expect seasonally lower IRA fees. However, given the acquisition of Atria earlier this month and the onboarding of Prudential later this quarter, we expect Service and Fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction revenue. It was $59 million, flat compared to Q2. As we look ahead to Q4, based on activity levels to-date, as well as the expected contribution from Atria and Prudential, we expect transaction revenue to increase by approximately $5 million sequentially. Now let's move on to Atria and Prudential. Starting with Atria, as mentioned, we closed on the transaction and continue to expect to onboard the advisors in mid-2025. Overall, the transaction is progressing well. We are on track to meet our estimate of 80% retention, but factoring in current asset levels, we now expect the run-rate EBITDA benefit to be approximately $150 million, up from our original estimate of $140 million. That said, in the near-term, given the timing of when synergies are realized, we anticipate our post-close, pre-conversion EBITDA to be roughly $40 million. Moving on to Prudential, we are on track to onboard them during Q4. As for Prudential's financial contribution, given current asset levels, which at the end of Q3 were approximately $60 billion, as well as current cash balances, we now expect approximately $70 million of run-rate EBITDA, up from our original $60 million estimate. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $359 million in Q3. Looking ahead, while there are variable costs associated with supporting our strong levels of organic growth, given our ongoing focus on efficiency, we are tightening our 2024 core G&A outlook to a range of $1.475 billion to $1.485 billion. Additionally, now that we have closed on our acquisition of Atria, and expect to onboard Prudential by the end of the year, we are including those costs in our overall core G&A outlook. As such, we expect Prudential and Atria to add $35 million to $40 million of core G&A in 2024. As a result, our new core G&A outlook range is $1.510 billion to $1.525 billion. Moving on to Q3 promotional expense. It was $176 million, up $28 million from Q2, primarily driven by conference spend as we hosted our annual Focus conference, as well as increased transition assistance resulting from our strong recruiting. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect promotional expense to decrease by approximately $10 million, driven by lower conference spend, partially offset by transition assistance related to Atria. As for regulatory expense, it was $25 million in Q3, up from Q2, as we recorded an $18 million charge related to a planned SEC settlement for anti-money laundering controls. Looking ahead, given the non-recurring nature of this item, we continue to expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter. Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $78 million in Q3, up $7 million sequentially. This included approximately $3 million of technology development related to Prudential. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in technology and recently, went live with two new internal data centers. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially. I would just note that we don't expect this level of sequential increase going forward. As for interest expense, it was $68 million in Q3, up $4 million sequentially, driven by the full quarter impact of the May debt issuance. Looking ahead to Q4, given revolver balances following the close of the Atria transaction, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $14 million sequentially. Regarding capital management, we ended Q3 with corporate cash of $708 million, up $24 million from Q2. As for our leverage ratio, at the end of Q3, it was 1.6 times. Looking ahead, consistent with our expectations, following the closing of the Atria transaction earlier this month, we anticipate our Q4 leverage ratio to be near the mid-point of our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5 times, and we expect corporate cash to return to more normalized levels, near our management target range of approximately $200 million. Moving on to capital deployment. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate: investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth, as well as M&A, where we allocated capital to our Liquidity & Succession solution, and on October 1, closed on the acquisition of Atria. Specific to share repurchases, a reminder that we paused buybacks following the announcement of the Atria acquisition. Now that we closed on the transaction, we plan to restart share repurchases in Q4, and anticipate buying back $100 million of our shares in the quarter. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well-positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Yes, Alex. I think on your point of calling the bottom, it's always tough. But I think just to reiterate some things that we've talked a fair bit about in the past that I think are relevant now as you just start to hone in on when you're looking at cash sweep, those are cash balances that are largely operational. So you're starting to get down to what is really the amount of cash necessary to do things like rebalancing, paying advisory fees, facilitating withdrawal, things of that nature. And where \u2013 when we look at that as a cash as a percent of AUM, right, that has been coming down. We've stabilized the last couple of quarters and just under 3% zone. But even if you look at the few quarters leading up to that, a big part of the driver \u2013 the primary part of the driver was really the denominator, I mean the market is going up, so that percentage came down. So if you look at it just as cash balances on an average per account, they have stabilized for a few quarters at just over $5,000. So to your point, it's always tough to call a bottom. But I think when you look at where we are right now, with the amount of cash that's in there really is the cash necessary to manage accounts. So then I think you pivot to really what does our growth outlook look like because as you bring in new accounts, if those on average are $5,000, you can \u2013 you've got strong organic growth like we do, and you do couple that with a stabilization, you can start to be in a place where you could see cash balances start growing again, right? So it's hard to promise that, but I think the dynamics that would lead to that are there, and we'll see how that plays out. Yes, Steven. I think there \u2013 we certainly view the stock as undervalued, maybe hitting the \u2013 leaning into buybacks first, which we are restarting as I covered in the prepared remarks, I think one of the really important things that I think we are unwavering on is having a strong balance sheet for many reasons. I think a lot of them are obvious, but maybe some of them are less obvious in that, if that is also a contributor to the driver of organic growth, right? When you look at the businesses that we serve and support being with a partner that's going to be able to withstand environments where interest rates go down or the equity markets go down, and not have to look inward and reduce their levels of investment like some other firms that they've come from, that is a really important thing. So I think when we look at our capital allocation, it's all in a construct of being within that leverage target range. And then I think when you click down within that, we continue to focus on driving returns, which includes share repurchases I think the returns on organic growth are better. The returns on M&A have been better, but the returns on share repurchases are compelling. So I think we would anticipate allocating capital to all those areas. I think to the first part of your question, I think from a market disconnect standpoint, I think there certainly is one. It's tough to understand how and why other than I think our conviction on the investments we're making that are going to drive long-term value that when you're doing things like bringing on a Prudential and that certainly does require a lot of upfront investment, upfront capital, that not only is a compelling return for that particular opportunity that opens up a broader market. These are all things that are an example of things that just drive long-term value. And probably not the first time in the history of the markets where the long-term opportunity is perhaps underappreciated. Certainly not underappreciated by us, which is why we've got the conviction to keep doing what we're doing. So hopefully, that helps. Yes, Mike. I think of use of capital. I think on the external side, it's early, right? Kind of hard to have a sharp estimate on where that goes from a capital allocation standpoint other than to underscore what Rich said the opportunity set there is quite large. But it's all volume dependent. So I just go back to kind of the key metrics and that we use on these deals, we're typically during the $10 million to $20 million zone, if you look at those internal deals per deal, we're doing 6 to 8 times EBITDA is largely the zone that we land. We've done about 40 so far and the purchase prices have kind of been in the middle of that zone, so call it, $0.5 billion. So that's probably a good way to think about going forward from here. And then I think external deals would just add on to that, probably at a lower multiple because you're getting not only \u2013 you're basically getting two things. You're getting the recruiting economics, which are typically at 3 to 4 times, and you're doing the L&S transaction, which is at 6% to 8%. So on average, there's probably a multiple that's a little bit lower. So than an internal. So hopefully, that helps guide you. Yes. I mean I think when you look at just the areas where we add costs, right, as we grow, it's a great insight to see where we can get more efficient and get more leverage and really drive down our cost to serve. So it's in the areas that have the largest headcount. And as Rich covered kind of the areas that I'm largely responsible for now. And I think when you look at what we're doing there is you've got a combination of investing in efficiencies, things like robotics, you've got opportunities as we improve our technology, as we improve our capabilities, the reasons that advisers may need to call our service center would decline, which allows you to grow this business without adding more heads there. So there's just a host of areas, Mike, where the more that we invest in efficiencies, the more that we improve our technology, the more that we get deeper and deeper into our expertise in all these different areas, the things that we're driving costs will come down. So I think it's a classic just cost to serve opportunity set that really has allowed us, if you just look at this year and this quarter, where we're delivering on quite strong levels of growth, but we're \u2013 our core G&A guidance is really within the range of where we started the year. And the reason for that is our cost to serve is coming down. And I think that's the focus and the intent that we'll have going forward as well. I don't think anybody heard that, if you mind repeating it. Thank you. Yes, Craig, I think when you look at the two big metrics that we'll focus on really is overall leverage, right? So 1.5x to 2.5x target range. I think we'll \u2013 between the mix of cash flow that we generate and deploy and the borrowings that we use, which I think is a more efficient use of capital than equity is really being in that range. And then allocating that capital to the areas that we've talked through. So organic growth, M&A, share repurchases. I think maybe specifically on your point on cash itself, that was elevated the last couple of quarters as we did opportunistically go to market in May when the markets were quite good to raise the cash to get ready to close on Atria. So when you go into Q4, you should expect to see that cash level \u2013 that corporate cash level to come back down to where we typically operate, which is in that 200-plus zone, which is the amount of cash we typically like to keep around. But then you'll see leverage more in that \u2013 right in the middle of that range of kind of call it around 2x. So that's where we like to anchor. And then based on where we are from a leverage standpoint, just take that liquidity and apply it to our capital allocation framework like we always have. Yes, Mike. We're in that planning process now. So we'll come back like we normally do in the year-end call and give that guidance. But I think that maybe the higher level things I would hit is one, just keep in mind, we'll have Pru and Atria for the full year effect of that in 2025. So if you kind of put that aside, I think and just reiterate what we talked about on this call, I think our focus will be continuing to invest to drive organic growth at the same time delivering that operating leverage. And I think \u2013 this year, I think, is a good example of those growth rates starting to come down and balance those two things versus 2022 and 2023, where we had more of an outsized investment. So we'll have that same perspective going into 2025, but we haven't landed those plans yet. It will be guided by the opportunities we see to invest and drive growth and by the opportunities we see to invest and deliver operating leverage and \u2013 but those principles be the thing that guides us."

            "name": "Rich Steinmeier",
            "content": "Thank you so much, operator. As a long-time listener and first-time caller, it's great to speak to everyone on today's call. For those that haven't met me, I'm Rich Steinmeier, and it's my privilege to serve as LPL's Chief Executive Officer. I joined the firm in 2018, following roughly a decade working in wealth management at a couple wirehouses, after having started my career in management consulting. I joined LPL with the mandate to accelerate our growth, and for the past six years, have worked closely with Matt and the rest of our leadership team, to set our strategic vision, and to build and execute on the plan to achieve that vision. Looking forward, our opportunity is clear to assert our leadership and shape both the advisor and institutional markets. Our focus is on creating the culture, strategy, and capabilities, to achieve sustainable outperformance by serving as an indispensable partner to our advisors and institutions, while delivering long-term value to shareholders. Okay. With introductions complete, let's turn to our results. In the quarter, total assets increased to a record $1.6 trillion, as we attracted organic net new assets of $27 billion, representing a 7% annualized growth rate. This was on pace with the past 12 months, during which we brought on nearly $100 billion of organic net new assets, representing approximately 8% growth. Our third quarter business results led to strong financial performance with an adjusted EPS of $4.16. Next, let's turn to our strategic plan and recent growth across our organic and inorganic initiatives. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, and provide unmatched flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us, and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisors' success throughout the lifecycle of their businesses. Doing this well, gives us a path to sustainable industry leadership, not just in the independent and institution markets, but across all of wealth management. In the third quarter, recruited assets were $26 billion, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to $87 billion, both of which represent records excluding periods when we onboarded large institutions. In our traditional independent market, recruiting reached a new quarterly high of approximately $23 billion in assets, improving on our already industry-leading capture rates of advisors in motion, while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth, Independent Employee, and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $3 billion in assets. And, as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace, and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities, will drive a sustained increase in their growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress within the large institution marketplace, where we advanced our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management businesses of Prudential Financial and Wintrust Financial. Collectively, these two partnerships will add approximately $76 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025. As a complement to our organic growth, earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions, welcoming their approximately 2,200 advisors, 160 institutions, and home office staff to the LPL family. The transaction is progressing well, and we are on track to meet our 80% retention target. As an aside, I've had the opportunity to spend time with the Atria team over the past several months, and it is clearer than ever, that their advisor-centric orientation and high quality relationships with their advisors and institutions makes them a perfect fit for LPL. As for our broader business, asset retention remains industry leading at 98% over the last 12 months. This is a testament to our continued efforts to enhance the advisor experience, through the delivery of new capabilities and technology, and the evolution of our service and operations functions. In that spirit, I would be remiss not to call out a driving force behind our improving advisor experience, which is the ongoing operational transformation of the firm, spearheaded by Matt. Beyond his leadership as CFO, Matt has been at the helm of our Operations and Risk organizations, and in his expanded role as President, we've consolidated additional responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of the firm under his purview, including customer service and supervision. It goes without saying that all of these critical functions are in very good hands. In closing, I want to reiterate how honored I am to lead this amazing firm, and to express my gratitude to our employees for the way they show up every day, to our advisors and institutions for their partnership, and to our shareholders for continuing to place their support and trust in LPL Financial. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt, who I would like to point out, dressed up as Johnny Cash for our company Halloween event last Friday, and I just wanted you to visualize that image as he dives into our results. The Men in Black theme. Great. Thank, Alex. Thanks for congratulating Matt and I on the expanded role. I actually really appreciate it. So as we jump in as a newly formed management committee into moving the business forward. I'd say there are three top priorities that we're thinking about every day. The first are, that we have got to maintain the client centricity that this firm is known for, that is in serving our advisers, our institutions and allowing them to serve their end clients with distinction. It's what the firm was built on. And so for us, that is one of the top priorities as we advance making sure that we don't lose sight of what's made us special. Second, which is a slight pivot is to empower our employees. This is the ability to take the employees who sit at the all levels of this firm who are deeply connected with our clients and empower them to take the decisions to help those clients achieve success in however they may define it. And so for us, that's about putting in place a decision-making framework and a control framework that allows all of our employees to have the authority to make better decisions in support of our clients. It will allow us to feel nimbler and more direct in serving the clients. The third priority is driving operating leverage. We have had the privilege of high levels of growth extended over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in remarks, we have had Matt take over all of the operations, service, compliance and supervision to try to drive and continue to drive operating leverage and value for our shareholders. But one thing, Alex, that I would point out that is not going to change is actually our strategy. Our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser centered marketplace, and that outlook remains positive. And as a reminder, that's driven by our conviction in three structural and durable trends, the growing demand for investor advice, the appeal to receive that advice from a financial professional, and the attractiveness of the independent model. We actually sit in a privileged position in the marketplace. We have outsized gains in advisers that change firms and that growth has enabled us to fuel our strategy of investing back in our platform and our capabilities. I think that strategy should persist and it will give us the opportunity to outperform over the longer-term. And maybe if you'll allow me, just one final thought. It's been three weeks where I have spent time meeting with hundreds of our clients. And what I've learned in those three weeks is that this firm is a very special place. In fact, the thing is our clients, actually, when I reach out to them, say, Rich, how can we help you? These relationships that we have with our clients have been built over years and decades. And in fact, those relationships are built on foundation of relationships, but it's not relationships with me as the CEO, its relationships with relationship managers, advisory consultants, branch managers, supervisory consultants, transition specialists. And what I've seen in the last three weeks are those employees have stepped up in a major way. Our clients are echoing that back to us. And if you think about our ability to succeed in the future, it will be driven by our clients being the loudest advocates for our firm, and that's what I've seen. I give huge kudos to our employee base. Thanks, Steven. I will take those each in turn. So let's start with the institutional channel. So as you know, we've had some nice success in the recent past, but maybe I'd start this discussion a little bit earlier because while we've had an acceleration certainly in our participation in the institutional channel in the last five years, this story starts decades ago, this firm has always served community banks, credit unions and built capabilities to actually serve them. And as we build those capabilities and committed to the growth in that channel, we started to attract really progressive firms, Old National Bank, South State, Webster, Simmons, and we grew our sophistication in the ability to serve larger institutions. As we did that, we made a concerted effort probably around 2020 to say there's a real opportunity inside the large bank channel. And that opportunity for us is because the demand of serving and delivering a wealth business which used to sit with lower thresholds to be able to participate, those were growing because of the expectations of regulatory changes of the needs to deliver an outstanding platform and the expectations of what end investors were requiring. And so we had a pivotal moment around 2021. When we had a leader in M&T choose us and that was probably one of the first times that a firm above $20 billion in wealth had chosen to partner with an outsourced firm. And at that point, it actually changed the dynamic in the marketplace from large firms being asked, why on earth would you outsource, to starting and ask the question of the leaders asking why aren't you considering outsourcing and partnering with a world-class partner. And that's not just the M&T, but it's the credibility of a Doris Meister and Matt McAfee, the leaders at that firm, and the position that they held in the marketplace where others actually really trusted their vision and trusted the decision that they made. So from there, we saw us beginning to snowball into the larger bank segment in a material way. And as a reminder, that's a $1 trillion market segment. And at this point, we've built capabilities where we are clearly the leader in the ability to deliver a world-class wealth management program in partnership with a financial institution. And beyond our capabilities, what happens is in two weeks, we'll have a round table where you will see the leaders of the industry at the roundtable and they happen to be our clients. And what happens in that scenario is that they are feeding from each other, learning from each other, pushing us and pushing each other. And so there are dynamics there that allow us to extend our leadership in that market. In a similar way, we then realized there is an opportunity for us to integrate the data that sits inside of a product manufacturer and insurance firm with the wealth data that allowed us to have a distinctive offering in the marketplace. We began discussions and found a willing partner in Prudential. And as we progress those discussions with Prudential and built towards this solution that we'll deliver in the last quarter of this year, we then realized that we now also have a distinctive offering in that marketplace in the integration of two different types of experiences that being the insurance as well as the wealth. Instead of having folks having to swivel chair back and forth, they now have a world-class integrated platform with end investor capabilities. That is second to none. Again, taking Caroline Feeney and Brad Hearn, the leaders of the wealth business there, taking a big, bold step with us. And in fact, what that has led to is beginnings of conversations inside the marketplace around, I think, the pivot that M&T drove in the marketplace, which is not why on earth would you outsource, but why aren't you considering a partner to achieve the efficiency, the derisking and the platform capabilities that would come with being with a world-class leader. So we think we feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue to progress our momentum, not only in the bank segment but as well as in that product manufacturer and insurance segment. And as a reminder, that segment is $1.5 trillion market opportunity as well. So I think we're building momentum. It still feels like early days, and it feels great that we're a leader presenting an opportunity to continue to grow as the requirements of scale continue to increase in those markets. If I turn the page Steven, and talk about high net worth and private wealth, maybe I have to go backwards again to go forward here. But a couple of years ago, we identified that we wanted to expand our participation in the wealth management market. And we realized that our capabilities were really strong. And in fact, the independent movement and the offering that we could bring to market around independents was incredibly well regarded in the marketplace. But we needed to build more capabilities to allow folks to get to independent. And that began our journey to introducing our strategic wealth services, which is the supported 1099 model. Then we introduced our Linsco independent employee model, and now more recently, what we've realized is as we built capabilities to support those more sophisticated advisers that are by and large coming out of the wires or other regional, we've built capabilities that allowed us to progress into a private wealth market. And we've been able to introduce in that market a unique offering because it brings the principles of independence and book ownership it brings higher payouts to the advisers, while also providing all of the capabilities expected in a private wealth offering, advanced planners, access to capital markets, partnership models to secure solutions for high net worth investors. And as you put that together, it feels like a second-to-none offering in the marketplace. Now there's a couple of things we'll have to build more capabilities around our alts capabilities, integrated banking capabilities and further progression inside of our advisory platforms, and we're on that journey. But as we progress those capabilities married with our learnings, what we've seen is early momentum that we feel really good about. And so, so far, since we launched that offering November 3 a year ago, we've had four teams joined serving over $2 billion in assets. And as we expand our participation in that market, that's a $5 trillion market opportunity that we see ourselves at the beginning of a trend and just like the Linsco offering and the strategic wealth offering that allowed us to penetrate wirehouse and regional advisers with greater distinction, we think that this is a distinctive offering that goes after those private wealth advisers and should lead us to sustained growth in this segment. Hey, Michael. It's Rich. Thank you so much for the kind words at the beginning. I'm going to start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Matt around the capital deployment. And so let's start with the momentum inside of liquidity and succession. I think you got to start with the background of how big is the opportunity. And so we think that over the next 10 years, we expect to see one-third of advisers retire in the industry. And as you look at the independent segment, which is the fastest-growing segment in the marketplace, there really wasn't a mature set of solutions to help those advisers retire. In fact, in the past, those solutions largely were seller financed moving from one adviser to the next, but the risk was often borne by the adviser who is selling the business. And so in 2022, with that backdrop, we came at this, I would say, from a different angle than many folks. We started \u2013 we had \u2013 in fact, it was driven by our existing clients asking us, please provide us a solution because we want to stay with LPL. We don't want to have to sell away and we don't want to lose control of our business. And in listening to those clients like we do on so many different things, we comprise an offering that, one, helps those advisers monetize their business at a fair market rate. Two, it identifies and supports the next generation of advisers, we call those the G2 advisers, where we will build a relationship with those advisers to help finance them in buying back that practice from the founder or the practitioner as it stands. And in fact, 70% of those transactions that we're involved in have an identified G2 adviser already in place inside of the practice. Three, we then move that business from that first generation to the second generation, but without changing the experience for the client, it's the same office it's the same brand. It's the same way that they deliver advice, maybe it's a planning-based orientation to advice. And so the clients actually feel continuity in that progression and not a disruptive move from one firm to the next. And then fourth, maybe oftentimes most important, those founders of those principles of the business, they want to see the legacy of their business protected. They're not in it for actually the top dollar. They want to see that what they built or maybe what their father or mother built continues into the next generation. And that's so important for them. And \u2013 so as we build that solution, which I will tell you, does not exist in the marketplace other than at this firm, we now see the proof in the pudding. Our advisers who have gone through and entered into a liquidity and succession agreement with us are some of the happiest advisers that we have at this firm. The NPSs are off the chart or Net Promoter Score is off the charts. And I got a tangible experience of this. We had our Focus conference not that long ago, and we hosted a happy hour with a number, probably 15 of those teams and advisers that had entered into that agreement with us. And I felt like the bell of the ball. I couldn't be \u2013 I was spun like a top because every one of them said, thank you so much for derisking my business. Thank you so much for getting it to the next generation. Thank you so much for not making me sell to another firm that is going to whitewash my business, change the way my clients are served, and shut my office down. And so that momentum we've seen internally, we have our most outspoken advisers are our largest advisers and our most influential advisers and so many of them are already in partnership with us. And so I think you'll see a continuing momentum on that internal opportunity for liquidity and succession. And what that's led to, first, in the external marketplace was that advisers who we were in discussions with to recruit them learned of how strong this program was, and it began to influence advisers consideration of our firm not to necessarily go through a liquidity and succession event, but recognizing that this was a unique solution that would want them \u2013 that would be attractive to them to join our firm. And I've been on so many HOVs with those large teams that are coming over specifically because they have optionality at some point to provide continuity into their staff and consistency into their clients. But then it went probably a step further, is obviously, we're trafficking in a lot of conversations with advisers at all stages of their development and their progression. And so as you've seen in the last quarter, we've begun to move into having direct liquidity and succession transactions with external advisers to our firm. We think that it works from two ways. One, primarily is attractive to join this firm because then they have the LNS solution, which is unique in the marketplace available for them when they want to move towards transitioning to the next generation. But two, we also do see, you can't look past that a third of advisers are going to retire in the next 10 years. That's not just at this firm. And with that offering, we think that it will be able to augment our way that we go to market in a way that will allow us to have an addressable market that is even larger than we have today. I'll turn it over to Matt to think about \u2013 to talk about the use of capital. Hey Mike, it's Rich. I'd love to add just one thing to that. One thing I wouldn't overlook in the construct of how we improve operating leverage is actually our organizational alignment. So the guy sitting across from me, who has demonstrated that he is one of the best CFOs in wealth management with an eye towards making sure he understands how the business is put together also now leads the largest components of cost for the firm. He understands how to responsibly deploy capital to build efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in our operating costs while doing that inside of that environment of being both the CFO and President. And so I think there's a lot of harmony in that evolved organizational alignment that should allow us to continue to make progress against that operating leverage. Yes, do it every day and twice on Sunday. Thank you. Hey Craig, it's Rich. I'll take that one. So let me start at the end of your question, which is do we intend to expand this platform further? The answer is yes. It goes to the journey that we've been on, which is that we started to serve really exceptional independent advisers. We then expanded our total addressable market by being very intentional at looking at wire house and regional advisers. And as we began to have success into those wires and regionals, the demand to join our firm continue to increase, but some of our capabilities were short of the absolute need that those advisers may have been used to at the other firms. And so that would center on alts [ph], some of our banking capabilities. And as I mentioned, the further extension of our wealth management platform and specifically our UMA. Inside of alts, over the last year, we've made significant progress in building towards a world-class platform. The first thing we did was expand our custodial and operational capabilities. And the second was then beginning the material expansion of our shelf of alts themselves. This is a multiyear effort. In fact, now we have over 20 folks working full time inside of the alts to go through diligence as well as to position to our adviser base to help them understand solutions and help them position them to their clients. In addition to those capabilities, specifically this year, we began a new \u2013 we've deployed a new alternative investment order entry system which we launched in the second quarter with a pilot set of advisers and have gotten a lot of feedback on. And in fact, we have used that launch in the second quarter to build and enhance what we call AIOE, our Alternative Investment Order Entry system so that it is much more intuitive and have better capabilities in support of a broad deployment at the end of the fourth quarter. The feedback that we've got from the advisers who went on the pilot has been incredibly positive. And as they've learned into our expanded capabilities in response to their feedback, it's only gotten stronger. So we look forward over the next year to finalizing that build reflective of the needs of those advisers and continue to expand that breadth of product offerings to achieve not only the opportunity to support our existing advisers, but as you mentioned, make us more attractive inside of those high net worth oriented advisers that either sit as what we would call maybe high net worth dabblers inside of the wires and regionals or those that are inside of the private wealth channels themselves. That goes to a little bit of maybe one of the earlier questions that I was answering. So you're spot on. This is a capability that is important to us that we have made investments in and we'll continue to make investments in until it becomes a world-class capability for us. Absolutely, Mike. Thank you for the question. I would note that Mike is the first person that has not congratulated you on your expanded role. So I also feel the same way you do, Mike. I think he should have just be a little more humble. So let's get into that question as well. Okay. Let's talk about the constraints on the institutional segment. There's a couple of things. If you think about accelerating the pace in an institutional segment, one of the differences between an adviser segment in the institutional segment is that the sales and engagement process is quite a bit longer. If you think about our engagement with Prudential, we actually were in discussions for a couple of years before we got to contracting, which then led us to a pretty sizable build \u2013 to build those capabilities. Now the good news is for incremental initiatives or incremental partnerships that we would have for so many of them, we won't have that long build cycle because we will have built the capabilities certainly inside the product manufacturer segment. On the bank side, we're the leader in capabilities. And so that again, that's going to have a longer sales cycle. That's not going to look like years, it's going to look like probably a nine-month sales cycle, you're going to see an RFI and an RFP and they're going to go through decisioning and then you've got contracting. And then you can think of anything between six months to 12 months as a time frame for which we're preparing to onboard that. And so what you'll get, Mike, is as you're building momentum, some of that you're not going to see in the short term is because as firms I specifically mentioned inside of the product manufacturer space, as they see through the Prudential transition and successful Prudential transition as they then raise their heads and start to get into an engagement process with us, you're going to have a pretty sizable lead time. And so that's one of the things you would see. Now you specifically asked about constraints so let's get back to constraint. A couple of years ago, as we would go through a major transition, we would think about having the capacity to do one a quarter. And I think that would have been a constraint at the time, and then we began to think about the ability to do one major transition a month. And I can tell you, in the last year or so, we started to feel that, that might be a constraint. And so we've built the capabilities and the capacity and the sophistication of our onboarding, and that's probably a really important component that I didn't allude to earlier because we've done so many of these large transition events, we've invested pretty heavily in digitizing and automating those transitions themselves. And so when Matt was talking about driving that operating leverage up, part of that is ongoing, but part of it is actually reducing the cost and the friction actually get those large firms over in a large event, either an M&A event or a partnership event. And so as we've gone through that, we have built the capacity now to handle multiple events inside of even a single month. We had that happen not that long ago. We had two events across a three-week period. and we did not miss a beat. And so we've begun to take away the constraint around the ability to transition material events at a pace that feels a lot more accelerated than we would have had in the past. But probably one of the things, Mike, is I'd probably lean more towards the first part of my answer, which is as firms see us as a more attractive offering. There's a lot of due diligence to go through. And in many cases, there's some custom build that has to go on. And so that back and forth, there's a lot of complex solutioning that our team is engaged with to understand their operating environment, especially in those larger firms. And that time frame is very hard to compress. You can compress the conversion, but it's harder to compress the sales cycle because of the complexity of so many of these really larger firms. I hope that helps. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again in January. Have a great night, and have a safe and happy Halloween."

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Arnold.\nDan Arnold: Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. To set the stage for tonight's call I'll start by taking us through our quarterly business results, and hand it over to Matt to cover the financials. Then, before we open the call up for Q&A, I'll take a few minutes to share our perspective on recent events in the marketplace related to sweep. Okay, with that as context, over the past quarter our advisors continue to provide their client with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their client. During the second quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and institutions solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. Now with respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.5 trillion. This continued solid organic growth was complemented by a higher equity market. Regarding organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $29 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $104 billion, also representing an 8% growth rate. In the second quarter, recruited assets were $24 billion, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to a record $93 billion. These results reflect the continuing appeal of our model as well as the strength of our recruiting across our expanded addressable markets. Looking at the same-store sales, our advisors remained focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing ones, a combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2. Same time, we continued to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations function. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter was approximately 98%, and 98% over the last 12 months. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.88. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now, as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace. To do that, the strategy is to invest back into the platform to provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us, and to delivery capabilities and services to help maximize advisors' success throughout the lifecycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us the sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories; horizontal expansion where we look to expand the ways that advisors and institutions can affiliate with us such that we are positioned to compete for all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace, and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology, and services that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and be great operators of the business. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the second quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $19 billion in assets. Same time, through the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates, while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee, and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered another solid quarter recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their growth. Next, in Q2, we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space, which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress within the large institution marketplace, where we advanced our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management businesses of Prudential Financial and Wintrust Financial. Collectively, these two deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025. Now as a complement to our organic growth, we are on track to close the acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions later this year, and complete the conversion in mid 2025. As a reminder, this acquisition will add approximately 2,400 advisors and 150 banks and credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion in client assets. In addition, we're seeing solid momentum within our Liquidity & Succession solution as demand continues to build with existing LPL advisors and with the advisors outside of our ecosystem, including the signing of another external deal in Q2. Next, I want to update you on our OSJ ecosystem. A reminder, that for many years we have collaborated with large OSJs in serving and supporting independent advisors on our platform. We've been actively working to strengthen our alignment with these firms for a number of years, driving incremental changes to the broader OSJ ecosystem over that period. This year, we've put a capstone on those efforts. And through that work there were a couple of isolated firms that surfaced as strategically misaligned with our mission and model because they were limiting advisors' ability to choose how and where they do business. That posture is in stark contrast to our core principles of advisor independence. And as a result, we have resolved to separate from these relationships. Collectively, these firms have roughly 20 billion applying assets, which began to off-board from our platform in July. At the end of the day, these separations will strengthen our overall ecosystem and position us to better serve the great partners on our platform. Now, within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to deliver a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services, and technology to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. And within this body of work, we're developing a comprehensive sweep of trading capabilities that will help advisors deliver a differentiated client experience and manage their advisory business more efficiently and effectively. In that spirit, we're rolling out a new trading system, ClientWorks Rebalancer, which enables advisors to rebalance models across multiple client accounts at one time and deliver a more personalized client experience across the book of business. In doing so, our aspiration is to help more advisors run models-based practices and ultimately turn trading from the administrative function into a strategic asset. The initial feedback on ClientWorks Rebalancer has been positive. We're seeing solid early adoption. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust. In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, closing six deals during the quarter and signing one deal with an external practice. Lastly, we remain on track to close on the Atria transaction in the second-half of the year and plan to onboard their business in mid-2025. So, as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our 23,000 advisors while continuing to deliver an industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth. Now, let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory brokerage assets were $1.5 trillion, up 4% from Q1, as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $29 billion, or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $24 billion, which prior to large institutions was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.88. Gross profit was $1.79 million up $13 million sequentially. As for the components, Commission Advisory Fees Net of Payout were $263 million up $3 million from Q1. Our payout rate was 87.3%, up 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, driven by the typical seasonal build and the production. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $361 million, down $12 million from Q1, as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Overall client cash balances ended the quarter at $44 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by record client net buying activity of $39 billion. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased slightly to roughly 70%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q2, there were roughly 2.1 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed 1.7 billion of those maturing balances into new three to six year contracts, yielding approximately 420 basis points, which is roughly 220 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 318 basis points in Q2, down 5 basis points from Q1. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 10 basis points. As for service and fee revenue, it was $135 million in Q2, up $3 million from Q1. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our annual focus conference, as well as higher IRA fees. Also, depending on the timing of the previously mentioned separation from a couple large OSJs, we could record up to an additional $5 million of fees. Moving on to Q2 transaction revenue, it was $59 million, up $2 million sequentially due to increased trading volumes. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2. Now, let's turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $371 million in Q2. Looking ahead, if our strong levels of organic growth continue into the second-half of this year, we would expect to be in the upper half of our 2024 Core G&A guidance range. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, in Q3, we expect Core G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense, it was $148 million, up $16 million from Q1, primarily driven by Prudential-related onboarding costs, as well as increased transition assistance resulting from our strong recruiting. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $170 million to $180 million, primarily driven by conference spend, as we will host our annual focus conference next month, as well as continued Prudential-related onboarding and integration costs. Turning to depreciation and amortization, with $71 million in Q2, up $4 million sequentially, looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $8 million sequentially, which includes approximately $3 million of technology development related to Prudential. Regarding capital management, we ended Q2 with corporate cash of $684 million, up $373 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 1.7 times, within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5 times. I would note that during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes, the proceeds of which will be used to finance our acquisition of Atria. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth as well as M&A, where we allocated capital to our liquidity and succession solution and closed on the acquisition of Crown capital. Specific to share purchases, a reminder that we paused buybacks following the announcement of the Atria acquisition. Our plan remains to evaluate restarting share purchases following close, which we expect to occur in the second-half of this year. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing, to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it back over to Dan.\nDan Arnold: Thanks, Matt. I'd be remiss not to acknowledge recent developments in the marketplace related to cash revenue and speculation on the potential read-throughs to our business. We have been evaluating the announced changes to better understand the impetus, magnitude, and competitive implications. As for the firms that have made changes, they have different business models and monetization frameworks, so we can only speculate as to the issues they may be addressing. As it relates to LPL, we continuously strive to ensure advisors have choice in the tools and products they use to serve their clients in a comprehensive way and feel good about our position both competitively and regulatory. To that end, and specific to client cash, our broad-based offerings range from solutions for operational balances to cash-like alternatives when seeking yield or income. Solutions like our Sweep Deposit Program, which offers expanded FDIC insurance and immediate liquidity for transaction of cash, to positional money market funds for those seeking higher yield and a liquid product, to CDs and fixed income funds to achieve interest rate exposure. In all, we feel good about the strong complement of cash solutions we provide. In that spirit, we do not have plans to change our prices, and believe our product stack provides advisors with the solutions they need to successfully service their clients. As always, we will remain agile and nimble as we continuously evaluate our solution set and control framework for opportunities to enhance our offering. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt.\nDan Arnold: Hi there.\nSteven Chubak: So, Dan, just appreciated the remarks around some of the sweep cash developments across the industry. Made it clear you have no plans to adjust sweep pricing on the platform at this time. Just looking out over the next few years, do you anticipate any wholesale changes to sweep deposit pricing and how sweep cash is monetized across the industry more broadly?\nDan Arnold: Yes, thanks for the question. And look -- and a little context of our jumping-off point, and then I love the future question. At the highest level, we evaluate all of our pricing in the context of our overall strategic pricing framework and value proposition, which we review regularly. So, within that framework we consider a host of factors, including industry benchmarking to ensure that we've competitively positioned ourselves in the marketplace. So, specific to the pricing of our cash sweep program, on our ICA, we take a dynamic and thoughtful approach, including household AUM-based tiers that range anywhere from 35 to 220 basis points. And that typically puts is in the top-half of the marketplace, and that's where we are today. And of course, I think as you look out over the next year and you look at the [indiscernible] you expect rates to change over that period of time that certainly will influence some of that pricing. But that's kind of where we are from a jumping off point and how we've approached it up to this point. I think as we look into the future, we obviously don't know what exactly the pricing might look like, but I do believe it challenges all of us to evolve and transform, and maybe even disrupt parts of our value proposition, including pricing, all in the spirit of helping our advisors better serve and support their clients. And that's what we've been trying to do over the last five years, that we've shared with you all that journey of investing back into the advisors' value proposition by lowering prices in areas that matter most to the advisors and their clients. In exchange we're obviously then enhancing the value that we provide to them. Now with respect to cash sweep pricing, it's just one element of the various discreet pricing mechanisms we consider, and not one of great priority to the advisors. That said, as we think about the future we'll continue to focus on pricing through our highly strategic wins, evaluating all fees and charges at the aggregate of our value proposition, and in context of the overall priorities and needs of the advisors and their clients. And to the extent that we're compelled to make a change with respect to this cash sweep program, I think because of our scale, because of our vertically integrated solution, because of the number of different affiliation programs that we have, we have great flexibility in how we think about our options and alternatives from a pricing standpoint -- and believe that across the aggregate of our different pricing options and alternatives, that we can make most any adjustment, do it in a very competitive way, and most likely turn it into a strategic opportunity. So, I hope that helps, some color. We don't know exactly what that looks like, but that's the discipline, and the framework and the folks that we take with respect to our pricing models.\nSteven Chubak: No, it's very helpful color, Dan, in framing your philosophy around that. Maybe just sticking to the same topic but just looking at it from a growth strategy lens, you got another strong quarter of NNA, continue to be active on liquidity and succession fronts. Just given some of the unknowns around the developments relating to sweep cash, whether it's competitive or regulatory, just want to get a sense as to whether that would alter your approach to underwriting deals, and do you anticipate any changes to TA for you and industry peers in light of some of these developments?\nDan Arnold: Yes, let me let Matt start with that, and then I'll follow with any color?\nMatt Audette: Yes, hey, Steven. I mean I think when you look at TA, just first and foremost a reminder of what's most important for advisors when they're determining and deciding to change firms, right? Their top priorities are really the capabilities, technology, service, that that's tier 1 for them. And then second is ongoing economics. And third is TA to really just facilitate, as the name would say, it's just in the transition from one firm to another. I think our approach of underwriting to returns, which we've been doing for quite some time at three to four times EBITDA, as a general rule, wouldn't change. And I think when you look across our revenue model to the extent that things move up and down within that, we've always reflected that. We've underwritten this way across a range of interest rate environments. I don't think that would change. We don't expect that to change. Just reiterating that there are other things that are much, much more important, and perhaps emphasizing Dan's point, I'll turn it back over to him, that we feel good where we are positioned from a value proposition to -- specifically for cash sweep, unless you want to --\nDan Arnold: Yes, and I just might add that I reinforce the -- it's the availability of the products that could give the advisors the necessary flexibility they need to meet their clients' needs. If I'm looking for yield or I'm looking for income, we make it very easily and accessible for them to access those solutions necessary to meet the needs of their clients. We're looking to simplify a client's life and make it very easy to pay for fees or get quick access to some liquidity or to store some cash in-between trades, et cetera, then we have a sweep vehicle that is intended to do that. And I think that's the key to the advisors, is that you give them the necessary flexibility so they can deliver a great experience to the client and have the solutions necessary to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. And we think that our portfolio does a good job of doing that.\nSteven Chubak: Great color, and thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, Dan. Hi, Matt. How are you?\nDan Arnold: Hi, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: I guess first question, want to ask on the centrally managed account specifically because we've received some questions on that as well. And so, it would be great just to get the percentage range of cash in these accounts. And then if you can just talk about the fiduciary obligation, either at the advisor level or at the firm level, when appropriate, on advisory cash in centrally managed accounts and maybe how that's different from just fee-based more broadly, if at all?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Devin, I'll start there. I mean I think when you look at centrally managed, we've got around $127 billion of assets in there, this is like 8% of total assets. From a cash standpoint, just similar to our business overall, the cash levels from a transactional cash standpoint are at low levels, think about it as about 3% of AUM, like our business overall. And in those models, right, if there's a portfolio allocation of cash beyond that. That goes into what Dan was just talking about, those investing cash options. So, it would go into things like money market funds, treasury, short-term bonds, and things like that. So, I think when you look at the cash allocations within centrally managed, I'd just reiterate our overall perspective that Dan articulated, I think, quite well, applies just the same to centrally managed. And we feel good about how that is set up, how that is priced, and the value prop, both on transactional cash, but as well as those investing cash products that are really available for advisors to make sure that they can serve and support their clients as needed.\nDan Arnold: I just would add that our allocations to cash within our centrally managed programs are consistent and the same across all models, whether they're contributed to by LPL research or external third-party management. So, there's a consistent and common structure between -- [technical difficulty]\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific color, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, can you remind us on what the OSJ economics generally look like on an EBIT ROA basis relative to the firm white average. I believe they're lower, but we'd love to just get a little color there. And then, we know this topic's been in the headline a bit, so not too surprising, but do you anticipate other OSJs to potentially exit intermediate term? It sounded like this was maybe part of a mutual process, but just wanted to get a little bit more color and expectations there. Thanks.\nMatt Audette: Yes, Devin, I'll start on the returns. You're right. I think when you look at our overall gross profit ROA for the firm, it's in the low 30s. For the firms that we're talking about, this 20 billion, it's around two-thirds of that. So, think in the low 20s. So, the returns are lower. And then, from organic growth standpoint, these folks weren't growing. They were actually a drag or reduction on organic growth. So, I think lower returning, lower growing would be the headline on those firms. Maybe on, Dan, maybe I'll turn it back to you on the -- [multiple speakers]\nDan Arnold: Yes, Devin, and as we look forward or strategically, I think now that we've strengthened and done a good job of aligning with these large OSJs, I think we're more convicted than ever that we can collectively pull through the synergies of our relationships and serve and support advisors really well, which ultimately will contribute to the overall growth of the business. I think we feel great about where we landed and it's work that it needed to be done. And it was done over an extended period of time dating back to 2018. So, I think in working through it, there's some key things that we focused on and solved for. One was making sure that we were well aligned on the value to be delivered by both parties, us and them, refining the policies on how to operate within our ecosystem, and then the legal agreements that helped memorialize all of that. Yes, and I think that's the right structure that gives us the foundation to go forth and work with these folks as a real contributor to growth and hope that helps.\nDevin Ryan: Very helpful, thanks so much. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nAlex Blostein: Hey Dan, hey Matt, hope you guys doing well. So, sticking with the topic, I guess of the starting season, I appreciate that you might not have the perfect visibility at what sort of happened with some of your larger competitors and the details and rationale obviously seem to be pretty murky there. But can you discuss how LPL's advisory offering might differ from what's transpired to the larger banks? And I guess, what gives you confidence that you will remain insulated from any regulatory action that may result in either higher client credit and rates or incremental shift to money market funds or kind of other higher yielding options? So, is it a function of disclosure or is it a function of account size? Anything else that you could provide supporting your view and thinking there would be great?\nDan Arnold: Alex, let me start with just maybe how we think about the programs being different and then I'll answer your bigger question around how do we think about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint going forward? So I think, look, as a starting point relative to the differences in the programs, we don't have an affiliated bank or proprietary mutual fund complex. So, we don't have that same structure or potential conflicts of interest. And we certainly have a different monetization program because of that with our cash sweep solution. As they would tend to monetize that business both on the cash sweep as well as potentially through the banks, and then the foundational structure around why we don't have proprietary products and the potential elimination of conflicts associated with essentially also earning asset management fees. So, those are, I think, foundational or big foundational difference, if you will, in our models. Second, those companies' sweep programs potentially are only sort of single-sleeved through their banks, right, and where we have a program that contracts with ultimately third-party banks. And so, we can actually create added benefit with our program through that by having 10 times the amount of FDIC insurance limits, 2.5 million for an individual, 5 million for a joint account is another place where I think there's a fundamental difference in our programs and our platforms from a value standpoint. Additionally, as part of our cash program offerings, we make all of the positional money market funds available to our advisors with a really low entry point of $10,000, and which is less typical in a lot of those, I think, firms that have contemplated moves. And for purchases in an advisory account, there's no ticket charge associated with these movements in and out of the money funds. So, we've tried to make it really easy and accessible to access a money market fund or any other of the alternative cash-like solutions so that these advisors can make sure they're easily meeting the needs of their clients and performing their duty of care. So, that's just some of the high-level places. We're different. It's not meant to be exhaustive. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it gives you a little color. Maybe to your second part of your question, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel good about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint. Now, why do we think that? Maybe a little color around that, if you take and create a framework around the regulatory guidelines, these typically will focus on duty of care obligations, operating control environment, and disclosure requirements. And as such, we regularly review all of these elements to ensure that we're operating within the prescribed requirements and guidelines. So, with respect to duty of care, we regularly review our sweep program and cash investment products to ensure we're meeting both our conduct standards and the needs of our advisors and their clients, and that we provide the flexibility and low barriers to entry in our solutions for investing cash to help our advisors serve and support their clients, and that's what I was just referring to earlier. And that is done consistent with their obligations as advisors. And then, we don't provide incentives for advisors to direct allocations to cash sweep programs. Another important point, I think, with respect to duty of care. Now, with respect to controls, there's any number of controls that we might have, but the one specifically in this area is we actively monitor the levels of cash position within advisory accounts, making sure that advisors are actively managing those accounts and there's not idle cash sitting in there that is not optimized, aligned with the client's goals and objectives for that overall portfolio. And then with respect to controls, I mean, sorry, and then with respect to disclosures, we provide clear and transparent disclosures describing the features and terms of our programs, including the fees we earn relative to the yield clients receive. So, to that end, that's why we feel that our cash offering controls, monetization framework, meet the needs and the expectations of all of the advisors. I know that was a lot, but I'll pause there.\nAlex Blostein: I got you. No, that was very comprehensive. I'll actually leave it there. I'm sure others will have questions as well. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just continue with the same theme on understanding that you don't have plans to change your sweep pricing, but maybe just to clarify, I was just hoping you might be able to unpack like what might lead you to change it at some point, what might be those different scenarios and to what extent have you heard from regulators on your sweep rates or disclosure practices and such? Thank you.\nDan Arnold: Yes, I think, Michael, with respect to the second part of your question, as an ongoing matter around our ongoing reviews with regulators, this is always a part of their review and we've had that consistent and constant discussion with them along the way. And part of the reason we feel very confident in our regulatory positioning today. I think with respect to the first part of your question, first and foremost, when we look at pricing, it's through the strategic lens. And we're always looking to make sure that we do two things. How do we make sure that we're differentiating in the marketplace with our overall sort of holistic value proposition? And then two, is that well aligned with our advisors' needs and their clients' needs? And those are the two biggest drivers that we think about relative to how we might invest, innovate, or evolve our pricing strategies. In the past five years, we've very much focused on advisory and transaction charges because that's sort of where the trend in the business was going. And that's where our advisors really challenged us to focus on and that's what drove that activity. And that's a great example of those two being the real catalyst for how we think about that. I think with respect to any other drivers, I mean, we should always be challenging ourselves to think outside the box. What can we learn from other places, other industries around how they create value, how they price, how they may create new value that extends new revenue streams that then could offset pricing somewhere else? So I think those are all part of how we challenge ourselves from an innovation standpoint to evolve this business model to ultimately enhance its value to the end client and to the advisor. And if we do that really well going forward, we'll create a lot of shareholder value through that. So, the good news is because we're vertically integrated, we have a clearing solution, we're a broker dealer, we're an RIA, we've created lots of services that are down inside the advisor's ecosystem. With that vertical integration, we've got lots of different levers of revenue of which we could think about, hey, where do we innovate to create new levels of revenue? If we wanted to modify or change one level of revenue, we can look at that as an investment back into the business or we can look at it as a, that's a bigger priority for advisors, so we'll offset that with a fee somewhere else. And so, I think that's the sort of the flexibility and the approach that we take in terms of scenario planning and trying to think about how we evolve this pricing again and best in line with serving the advisors in the client. I hope that helps. It's nothing specific, but it at least gives you the sense of how we think about it.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow up question if I could here, just as you look at the actions of others across the industry and based on conversations you're having with folks across the industry, including regulators, do you have any sense whether or not the goalpost is moving beyond practices that have been accepted over the years that are disclosure based?\nDan Arnold: That is not our sense. I think there's a pretty tidy and clear regulatory framework of which that we all understand how to operate in. That regulatory framework governs the entire aggregate value proposition and relationships that we have with clients. And again, I think anywhere where there may be a potential conflict within that overall aggregate business model, there's a requirement to disclose and to be clear to set that expectation for the client so that they can make an informed choice. And that's a very logical and very principled way to approach it. And we think when we begin to change principles, it's much, much harder to change that. And so, we don't necessarily see that on the landscape. I will tell you, we're not clairvoyant, so we don't have all the answers, but we're not seeing signs that that would ultimately change from the goal. It's a great question.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question, please.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Maybe I'll start on the same topic that everyone else has, but just a follow-up on the advisory cash discussion. You mentioned that 3% of the centrally managed program is in sweep. I guess, can you provide any color on cash as a percentage of client assets for total advisory accounts in the corporate RIA? So on the $568 billion of assets or so. I think in the past you've mentioned that typically there's higher cash allocations in those accounts versus brokerage, but not sure if that's still true today.\nMatt Audette: Yes, I think when you look at cash as a percentage of AUM overall, it's around 3%. The centrally managed is a little bit above that. And I think when you look at the rest of advisory, it's still in the same ballpark, but it's a little bit above centrally managed. I think on brokerage, that cash is around 2.5%. And that's because brokerage has a lot of business and accounts that just simply have no cash at all, like annuities and direct business on the mutual fund side. So, you end up, brokerage overall ends up having a smaller balance or smaller percentage. But headline point is on the outside of centrally managed, on the advisory side, it's in the same ballpark. It's just a little bit higher.\nKyle Voigt: That's helpful, thank you. And then, Matt, just wondering also if you could give an update on July to date sweep cash balances and related to the OSJs that are off-boarding towards the end of this month or starting this month, any color on if they have a similar cash as percentage client assets as well, which I think would imply maybe $600 million or so of an impact that we should expect to show up in the monthly figures this quarter?\nMatt Audette: Yes, I think so. So, on how things are trending so far in July, I mean, a headline I would give you is it's shaping up to be a good month. And especially when you factor in the seasonality that I think you're well familiar with on month one of a quarter, but I'll walk through that. I think specific to client cash, so a reminder that seasonality is advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter. So, that'll reduce cash in July by around $1.4 billion, all else being equal. And flows outside of that have been an inflow of around $700 million. So, when you put those two things together, what we've seen from a cash sweep standpoint in July is a decline of around $700 million or putting it at around $43.3 billion. To add to that on the organic growth side, those advisory fees impact organic growth just the same, hit in that first month at $1.4 billion. And outside of that, the momentum we've seen in the first-half of this year, and as we saw in this quarter, has really continued. So, I think that puts us in it from an organic growth standpoint in July, looking at something in that 6% to 6.5% zone, keeping in mind that it's usually the lowest month of the quarter. Now those numbers are, to your point on the OSJs, those numbers are prior to any impact of those OSJs leaving. We'll make sure as we report results to clearly delineate the impact that those have had, meaning how much of that 20 billion has flowed out. We'll just make that clear going forward. Very little has flowed out so far. And to your point on cash, I don't think there's anything distinct to different from an amount of cash standpoint from those two firms. But again, we'll make it clear in the metrics as probably over the next three or four months is when it'll flow out. We'll make it clear so you can see that versus the rest of the business.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks, matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please.\nMichael Cho: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for sweeping in here. I'm going to skip the regulatory and cash discussion. I just wanted to follow up on the OSJ. Matt, you talked through kind of the timing and that you'll delineate kind of going forward. I'm just curious, and this is not necessarily new, but what kind of areas were particularly misaligned as you characterized? And going forward, and Dan you touched on a little bit, how would you frame the potential for other OSJs maybe falling into similar buckets over time?\nDan Arnold: Yes, so going forward to answer your second part of your question, because of the alignment and the structure we've put around the program, there's very little probability that that would occur. I think back to your first part of your question, we see in some cases where an OSJ may buy up their advisors' practices, turn them into more of an employee-based construct, and ultimately, because of that alignment, that approach, it's more of a captive type of model at that point, which again, is very different from the principles of independence and providing the flexibility for those advisors to move those assets where they want to or go where they want to. I think that's our point. As soon as they begin to lose the principles of independence within the model, we have a hard time with that sitting within our platform and within our ecosystem. So, that's an example of something that I think we were just trying to make sure we had alignment on and teased out, such that as we go forward, that foundational principle is in place across our collective ecosystem. Hope that helps.\nMichael Cho: Great, thanks, Dan. And then, just to switch gears a little bit, just on the annuity side, annuities continue to remain solid. Clearly, the rate environment has helped and continues to help, but I'm wondering what you're seeing at the incremental level that the strong demand in recent quarters of years could be nearing any sort of normalization point yet, just given the strong growth that annuities have been seeing on LPL's platform.\nDan Arnold: Sorry, what was the second-half of that? You just broke up a little bit?\nMichael Cho: Yes, no, on the any sort of normalization that you might see on the strong demand.\nDan Arnold: Sorry, got it. Okay, thank you. Yes, so look, I think that if you look at the marketplace and the growth, call it over the last year or two, it's very much a couple of things happening. The foundation of an annuity as it supports and helps someone with the retirement planning is clearly a relevant problem to be solving for many folks as they think about one of those all-important life goals. And so, it's a relevant solution across a broad opportunity set. And with the rate environment becoming very, very different than the one we lived in for an extended period of time, it has created an opportunity, obviously, to help clients solve for creating that revenue stream or income stream in retirement, and certainly whether it be a fixed or a variable annuities are well positioned to do that as with a steepening yield curve may occur as we go forward. That also is helpful with respect to variable annuities in terms of the features and benefits that they provide. And so, that is obviously something that if you've got more appealing features and benefits relative to the macro, then obviously that's something that can differentiate annuities relative to other options and alternatives. From a seasonality standpoint, I look at it, it's probably more of a product choice in solving a really important need for a broad set of an advisor's clients than necessarily a found opportunity, if you will, to create new asset gathering opportunity because the features are more sound. I think it's ultimately more of a how do you ultimately pick which solution you're going to use to best serve and support the client. So, I don't think it necessarily creates some step down or step up as much as it's just a demonstration of a heavier utilization in a product given the market conditions. That said, as we evolve and grow our number of advisors on our platform, that certainly is a tailwind to the overall volumes of brokerage solutions, or in this case, annuity solutions being done. So, that certainly does provide some tailwind of growth. I hope that helps. Do you want to add anything to that?\nMatt Audette: No. No. Well said.\nMichael Cho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. So, just a question on the environment for recruiting, obviously, $24 billion, quite strong in the quarter, can you talk to the economics of those assets today versus maybe what you were underwriting a year ago? And then, ultimately, you talked about good momentum, I think, into July and the backlog, so maybe some characterizations around how that's progressing as we think about the rest of the year.\nMatt Audette: Yes, Dan, I'll start. On the economics and underwriting, kind of to my point earlier to Steven's question, I think our underwriting approach and economics haven't changed. I think we underwrite to returns, TA, and the economics there are really the third thing that advisors are looking at. But the return hurdles and the underwritings have not changed. If you think about it as recruiting in general comes on board at three to four times EBITDA and that has not moved much.\nDan Arnold: Yes, and with respect maybe to your second question, just again, as we said in the remarks and as you just said, as a jumping off point, you had recruited assets of $24 billion in Q2 a $93 billion over the trailing 12, which is a solid place for momentum. And we continue to see that momentum into the third quarter. I think we're seeing it across all of our affiliation models. So, you've got good diversification in that opportunity set. That's being driven by this continued evolution of the appeal of our model and then that breadth of market that we serve given the different affiliation models. So, as we look in the third quarter, we certainly see momentum there. And beyond that, given those sort of structural value that we're creating inside the model, our go-to-market strategy and efficacy around how we deliver that to the marketplace, we feel a pretty good, strong structural trend. So, as we look out even further and beyond third quarter, we feel good about that momentum across all of our models. At the same time, we have some built in, as we've talked about institutions, large institutions that have yet to onboard, that collectively represent 66 million in sort of recruited large institutions. So, that certainly is a tailwind to that outlook as well. So, we got really good positioning across all models in your advisor recruiting. And then, on the institution side, you've got that already committed wins in the pipeline. And then, beyond that, we feel good about that evolving and growing pipeline across both large banks as well as insurance services. Hope that helps.\nDan Fannon: Yes, that is helpful. And then, just a quick one, Matt, on expenses, the promo spend is a sizable pickup both sequentially as well as year-over-year. I think you said conferences, but I mean, you have this conference every year, so, just curious about the magnitude of the pickup? And then, should we see that normalize again in the fourth quarter after I guess, what would be seasonal pickups?\nMatt Audette: Yes, I mean, I think there are a couple of things. I think the conference from a seasonality standpoint, it is in Q3 each year. So, just given a little, I was giving color on the sequential change. The other thing I'd keep in mind is specific to the onboarding costs associated with Prudential. Just a reminder of the spend there to bring them on board. There's no TA associated with Prudential. It's really important to them. It's really the technology build and the process to get on board. So, when you look at what we're spending there, $125 million of integration cost and $200 million of technology, that is the entire amount that's being spent there and a lot of that will show up in promotional. So, when you think about the trends, especially year-over-year, probably the spend-related Prudential, which will when you look at the overall spend, probably peak or the two highest quarters are likely be Q2 and Q3, related to that. I think when you get on the other side of that, meaning on the other side of our largest conference, you get into Q4 and you get on the other side of Prudential-related spend, I think then you get into the core drivers, just the level and amount of our recruiting, right? So, the underwriting to TA hasn't changed, then it's really just driven by the really the tonnage or the amount of recruiting we're doing, which I think we've covered a few times, we keep hitting new record levels. So, we think it's a good use of capital, but hopefully that helps give you a little sense as to why that number is increasing. It's largely a timing of conferencing potential.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your question, please.\nBrennan Hawken: Hi, good evening. Thanks for fitting me in. I'd like to ask a question on the upcoming fixed rate maturity. So, you guys are now at about 70% of the ICA and fixed rate. Are you going to continue to roll the maturities into fixed rate? Or at this point, is there some benefit to seeing the floating rate side pickup, bring you closer to the mid or even lower end of the targeted range?\nMatt Audette: Yes, Brennan. I think when you look at our approach there in targeting 50% to 75% and I think looking at what I think most folks would conclude a peak rate environment that we're in right now. I think while we always want to be within that range, I think we like being towards the, call it the upper half of the range than where we are now, just given where the rate environment is. So, I think as we move forward in the next couple of quarters, we get about $2 billion maturing each quarter. Based on where sweep balances are overall and where rates are overall, we'll make those choices. But I think in the near term, I think we like being in that upper-half. When you look at where rates are for those fixed rate contracts, we typically will deploy in the three to five year points on the curve. And those rates including the spreads that you can earn, which are in that 20 to 30 basis point range, are around 400 right now. So, that should hopefully give you a sense as to where we would deploy that, which would be above the rates that they're currently earning. So, I hope that helps with the headline is we like 50% to 75%. We like being kind of towards the top half of that just given where the rate environment is.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks, Matt. That's helpful. And then, second question, I noticed that the advisor loan growth was a little healthy here quarter-over-quarter, up about 12%. I know that you closed some deals, so I expect some might be deal-related, but really be helpful if you can maybe unpack some of the contributors to that growth here.\nMatt Audette: Yes. I think from a TA standpoint, remember, there's two things in there. We don't necessarily break them out in the release. But there is TA as well as repayable loans, right? So it's not all entirely TA-related. For the components that are TA-related, just emphasize kind of what we're talking about before. The underwriting standards have not changed. We do continue to deliver record levels of recruiting, so it's more volume, but the rates that we're paying are consistent. And just keep in mind that, TA is not the entire driver of that line item.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Was there some contribution from the recently closed deals though in that growth?\nMatt Audette: Yes. So, I think when you're talking about advisor loans, so the recently closed deals were acquisitions. So, that would be -- that would come out in a different spot. It would show up in goodwill and other places. Specific to the loans, that would just be to the extent we're doing growth-related loans or things of that nature. The primary driver is typically TA. It would just be connected to the record recruiting quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks.\nDan Arnold: Just thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Matt Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust. In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, closing six deals during the quarter and signing one deal with an external practice. Lastly, we remain on track to close on the Atria transaction in the second-half of the year and plan to onboard their business in mid-2025. So, as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our 23,000 advisors while continuing to deliver an industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth. Now, let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory brokerage assets were $1.5 trillion, up 4% from Q1, as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $29 billion, or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $24 billion, which prior to large institutions was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.88. Gross profit was $1.79 million up $13 million sequentially. As for the components, Commission Advisory Fees Net of Payout were $263 million up $3 million from Q1. Our payout rate was 87.3%, up 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, driven by the typical seasonal build and the production. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $361 million, down $12 million from Q1, as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Overall client cash balances ended the quarter at $44 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by record client net buying activity of $39 billion. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased slightly to roughly 70%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q2, there were roughly 2.1 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed 1.7 billion of those maturing balances into new three to six year contracts, yielding approximately 420 basis points, which is roughly 220 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 318 basis points in Q2, down 5 basis points from Q1. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 10 basis points. As for service and fee revenue, it was $135 million in Q2, up $3 million from Q1. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our annual focus conference, as well as higher IRA fees. Also, depending on the timing of the previously mentioned separation from a couple large OSJs, we could record up to an additional $5 million of fees. Moving on to Q2 transaction revenue, it was $59 million, up $2 million sequentially due to increased trading volumes. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2. Now, let's turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $371 million in Q2. Looking ahead, if our strong levels of organic growth continue into the second-half of this year, we would expect to be in the upper half of our 2024 Core G&A guidance range. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, in Q3, we expect Core G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q2 promotional expense, it was $148 million, up $16 million from Q1, primarily driven by Prudential-related onboarding costs, as well as increased transition assistance resulting from our strong recruiting. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $170 million to $180 million, primarily driven by conference spend, as we will host our annual focus conference next month, as well as continued Prudential-related onboarding and integration costs. Turning to depreciation and amortization, with $71 million in Q2, up $4 million sequentially, looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $8 million sequentially, which includes approximately $3 million of technology development related to Prudential. Regarding capital management, we ended Q2 with corporate cash of $684 million, up $373 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 1.7 times, within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5 times. I would note that during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes, the proceeds of which will be used to finance our acquisition of Atria. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth as well as M&A, where we allocated capital to our liquidity and succession solution and closed on the acquisition of Crown capital. Specific to share purchases, a reminder that we paused buybacks following the announcement of the Atria acquisition. Our plan remains to evaluate restarting share purchases following close, which we expect to occur in the second-half of this year. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing, to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it back over to Dan. Yes, hey, Steven. I mean I think when you look at TA, just first and foremost a reminder of what's most important for advisors when they're determining and deciding to change firms, right? Their top priorities are really the capabilities, technology, service, that that's tier 1 for them. And then second is ongoing economics. And third is TA to really just facilitate, as the name would say, it's just in the transition from one firm to another. I think our approach of underwriting to returns, which we've been doing for quite some time at three to four times EBITDA, as a general rule, wouldn't change. And I think when you look across our revenue model to the extent that things move up and down within that, we've always reflected that. We've underwritten this way across a range of interest rate environments. I don't think that would change. We don't expect that to change. Just reiterating that there are other things that are much, much more important, and perhaps emphasizing Dan's point, I'll turn it back over to him, that we feel good where we are positioned from a value proposition to -- specifically for cash sweep, unless you want to -- Yes, Devin, I'll start there. I mean I think when you look at centrally managed, we've got around $127 billion of assets in there, this is like 8% of total assets. From a cash standpoint, just similar to our business overall, the cash levels from a transactional cash standpoint are at low levels, think about it as about 3% of AUM, like our business overall. And in those models, right, if there's a portfolio allocation of cash beyond that. That goes into what Dan was just talking about, those investing cash options. So, it would go into things like money market funds, treasury, short-term bonds, and things like that. So, I think when you look at the cash allocations within centrally managed, I'd just reiterate our overall perspective that Dan articulated, I think, quite well, applies just the same to centrally managed. And we feel good about how that is set up, how that is priced, and the value prop, both on transactional cash, but as well as those investing cash products that are really available for advisors to make sure that they can serve and support their clients as needed. Yes, Devin, I'll start on the returns. You're right. I think when you look at our overall gross profit ROA for the firm, it's in the low 30s. For the firms that we're talking about, this 20 billion, it's around two-thirds of that. So, think in the low 20s. So, the returns are lower. And then, from organic growth standpoint, these folks weren't growing. They were actually a drag or reduction on organic growth. So, I think lower returning, lower growing would be the headline on those firms. Maybe on, Dan, maybe I'll turn it back to you on the -- [multiple speakers] Yes, I think when you look at cash as a percentage of AUM overall, it's around 3%. The centrally managed is a little bit above that. And I think when you look at the rest of advisory, it's still in the same ballpark, but it's a little bit above centrally managed. I think on brokerage, that cash is around 2.5%. And that's because brokerage has a lot of business and accounts that just simply have no cash at all, like annuities and direct business on the mutual fund side. So, you end up, brokerage overall ends up having a smaller balance or smaller percentage. But headline point is on the outside of centrally managed, on the advisory side, it's in the same ballpark. It's just a little bit higher. Yes, I think so. So, on how things are trending so far in July, I mean, a headline I would give you is it's shaping up to be a good month. And especially when you factor in the seasonality that I think you're well familiar with on month one of a quarter, but I'll walk through that. I think specific to client cash, so a reminder that seasonality is advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter. So, that'll reduce cash in July by around $1.4 billion, all else being equal. And flows outside of that have been an inflow of around $700 million. So, when you put those two things together, what we've seen from a cash sweep standpoint in July is a decline of around $700 million or putting it at around $43.3 billion. To add to that on the organic growth side, those advisory fees impact organic growth just the same, hit in that first month at $1.4 billion. And outside of that, the momentum we've seen in the first-half of this year, and as we saw in this quarter, has really continued. So, I think that puts us in it from an organic growth standpoint in July, looking at something in that 6% to 6.5% zone, keeping in mind that it's usually the lowest month of the quarter. Now those numbers are, to your point on the OSJs, those numbers are prior to any impact of those OSJs leaving. We'll make sure as we report results to clearly delineate the impact that those have had, meaning how much of that 20 billion has flowed out. We'll just make that clear going forward. Very little has flowed out so far. And to your point on cash, I don't think there's anything distinct to different from an amount of cash standpoint from those two firms. But again, we'll make it clear in the metrics as probably over the next three or four months is when it'll flow out. We'll make it clear so you can see that versus the rest of the business. No. No. Well said. Yes, Dan, I'll start. On the economics and underwriting, kind of to my point earlier to Steven's question, I think our underwriting approach and economics haven't changed. I think we underwrite to returns, TA, and the economics there are really the third thing that advisors are looking at. But the return hurdles and the underwritings have not changed. If you think about it as recruiting in general comes on board at three to four times EBITDA and that has not moved much. Yes, I mean, I think there are a couple of things. I think the conference from a seasonality standpoint, it is in Q3 each year. So, just given a little, I was giving color on the sequential change. The other thing I'd keep in mind is specific to the onboarding costs associated with Prudential. Just a reminder of the spend there to bring them on board. There's no TA associated with Prudential. It's really important to them. It's really the technology build and the process to get on board. So, when you look at what we're spending there, $125 million of integration cost and $200 million of technology, that is the entire amount that's being spent there and a lot of that will show up in promotional. So, when you think about the trends, especially year-over-year, probably the spend-related Prudential, which will when you look at the overall spend, probably peak or the two highest quarters are likely be Q2 and Q3, related to that. I think when you get on the other side of that, meaning on the other side of our largest conference, you get into Q4 and you get on the other side of Prudential-related spend, I think then you get into the core drivers, just the level and amount of our recruiting, right? So, the underwriting to TA hasn't changed, then it's really just driven by the really the tonnage or the amount of recruiting we're doing, which I think we've covered a few times, we keep hitting new record levels. So, we think it's a good use of capital, but hopefully that helps give you a little sense as to why that number is increasing. It's largely a timing of conferencing potential. Yes, Brennan. I think when you look at our approach there in targeting 50% to 75% and I think looking at what I think most folks would conclude a peak rate environment that we're in right now. I think while we always want to be within that range, I think we like being towards the, call it the upper half of the range than where we are now, just given where the rate environment is. So, I think as we move forward in the next couple of quarters, we get about $2 billion maturing each quarter. Based on where sweep balances are overall and where rates are overall, we'll make those choices. But I think in the near term, I think we like being in that upper-half. When you look at where rates are for those fixed rate contracts, we typically will deploy in the three to five year points on the curve. And those rates including the spreads that you can earn, which are in that 20 to 30 basis point range, are around 400 right now. So, that should hopefully give you a sense as to where we would deploy that, which would be above the rates that they're currently earning. So, I hope that helps with the headline is we like 50% to 75%. We like being kind of towards the top half of that just given where the rate environment is. Yes. I think from a TA standpoint, remember, there's two things in there. We don't necessarily break them out in the release. But there is TA as well as repayable loans, right? So it's not all entirely TA-related. For the components that are TA-related, just emphasize kind of what we're talking about before. The underwriting standards have not changed. We do continue to deliver record levels of recruiting, so it's more volume, but the rates that we're paying are consistent. And just keep in mind that, TA is not the entire driver of that line item. Yes. So, I think when you're talking about advisor loans, so the recently closed deals were acquisitions. So, that would be -- that would come out in a different spot. It would show up in goodwill and other places. Specific to the loans, that would just be to the extent we're doing growth-related loans or things of that nature. The primary driver is typically TA. It would just be connected to the record recruiting quarter."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. To set the stage for tonight's call I'll start by taking us through our quarterly business results, and hand it over to Matt to cover the financials. Then, before we open the call up for Q&A, I'll take a few minutes to share our perspective on recent events in the marketplace related to sweep. Okay, with that as context, over the past quarter our advisors continue to provide their client with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their client. During the second quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisors and institutions solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. Now with respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.5 trillion. This continued solid organic growth was complemented by a higher equity market. Regarding organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $29 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $104 billion, also representing an 8% growth rate. In the second quarter, recruited assets were $24 billion, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to a record $93 billion. These results reflect the continuing appeal of our model as well as the strength of our recruiting across our expanded addressable markets. Looking at the same-store sales, our advisors remained focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing ones, a combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2. Same time, we continued to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations function. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter was approximately 98%, and 98% over the last 12 months. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.88. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now, as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace. To do that, the strategy is to invest back into the platform to provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us, and to delivery capabilities and services to help maximize advisors' success throughout the lifecycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us the sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth, and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories; horizontal expansion where we look to expand the ways that advisors and institutions can affiliate with us such that we are positioned to compete for all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace, and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology, and services that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and be great operators of the business. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the second quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $19 billion in assets. Same time, through the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates, while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee, and our enhanced RAA offering, we delivered another solid quarter recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their growth. Next, in Q2, we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space, which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress within the large institution marketplace, where we advanced our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management businesses of Prudential Financial and Wintrust Financial. Collectively, these two deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025. Now as a complement to our organic growth, we are on track to close the acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions later this year, and complete the conversion in mid 2025. As a reminder, this acquisition will add approximately 2,400 advisors and 150 banks and credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion in client assets. In addition, we're seeing solid momentum within our Liquidity & Succession solution as demand continues to build with existing LPL advisors and with the advisors outside of our ecosystem, including the signing of another external deal in Q2. Next, I want to update you on our OSJ ecosystem. A reminder, that for many years we have collaborated with large OSJs in serving and supporting independent advisors on our platform. We've been actively working to strengthen our alignment with these firms for a number of years, driving incremental changes to the broader OSJ ecosystem over that period. This year, we've put a capstone on those efforts. And through that work there were a couple of isolated firms that surfaced as strategically misaligned with our mission and model because they were limiting advisors' ability to choose how and where they do business. That posture is in stark contrast to our core principles of advisor independence. And as a result, we have resolved to separate from these relationships. Collectively, these firms have roughly 20 billion applying assets, which began to off-board from our platform in July. At the end of the day, these separations will strengthen our overall ecosystem and position us to better serve the great partners on our platform. Now, within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to deliver a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services, and technology to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. And within this body of work, we're developing a comprehensive sweep of trading capabilities that will help advisors deliver a differentiated client experience and manage their advisory business more efficiently and effectively. In that spirit, we're rolling out a new trading system, ClientWorks Rebalancer, which enables advisors to rebalance models across multiple client accounts at one time and deliver a more personalized client experience across the book of business. In doing so, our aspiration is to help more advisors run models-based practices and ultimately turn trading from the administrative function into a strategic asset. The initial feedback on ClientWorks Rebalancer has been positive. We're seeing solid early adoption. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thanks, Matt. I'd be remiss not to acknowledge recent developments in the marketplace related to cash revenue and speculation on the potential read-throughs to our business. We have been evaluating the announced changes to better understand the impetus, magnitude, and competitive implications. As for the firms that have made changes, they have different business models and monetization frameworks, so we can only speculate as to the issues they may be addressing. As it relates to LPL, we continuously strive to ensure advisors have choice in the tools and products they use to serve their clients in a comprehensive way and feel good about our position both competitively and regulatory. To that end, and specific to client cash, our broad-based offerings range from solutions for operational balances to cash-like alternatives when seeking yield or income. Solutions like our Sweep Deposit Program, which offers expanded FDIC insurance and immediate liquidity for transaction of cash, to positional money market funds for those seeking higher yield and a liquid product, to CDs and fixed income funds to achieve interest rate exposure. In all, we feel good about the strong complement of cash solutions we provide. In that spirit, we do not have plans to change our prices, and believe our product stack provides advisors with the solutions they need to successfully service their clients. As always, we will remain agile and nimble as we continuously evaluate our solution set and control framework for opportunities to enhance our offering. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Hi there. Yes, thanks for the question. And look -- and a little context of our jumping-off point, and then I love the future question. At the highest level, we evaluate all of our pricing in the context of our overall strategic pricing framework and value proposition, which we review regularly. So, within that framework we consider a host of factors, including industry benchmarking to ensure that we've competitively positioned ourselves in the marketplace. So, specific to the pricing of our cash sweep program, on our ICA, we take a dynamic and thoughtful approach, including household AUM-based tiers that range anywhere from 35 to 220 basis points. And that typically puts is in the top-half of the marketplace, and that's where we are today. And of course, I think as you look out over the next year and you look at the [indiscernible] you expect rates to change over that period of time that certainly will influence some of that pricing. But that's kind of where we are from a jumping off point and how we've approached it up to this point. I think as we look into the future, we obviously don't know what exactly the pricing might look like, but I do believe it challenges all of us to evolve and transform, and maybe even disrupt parts of our value proposition, including pricing, all in the spirit of helping our advisors better serve and support their clients. And that's what we've been trying to do over the last five years, that we've shared with you all that journey of investing back into the advisors' value proposition by lowering prices in areas that matter most to the advisors and their clients. In exchange we're obviously then enhancing the value that we provide to them. Now with respect to cash sweep pricing, it's just one element of the various discreet pricing mechanisms we consider, and not one of great priority to the advisors. That said, as we think about the future we'll continue to focus on pricing through our highly strategic wins, evaluating all fees and charges at the aggregate of our value proposition, and in context of the overall priorities and needs of the advisors and their clients. And to the extent that we're compelled to make a change with respect to this cash sweep program, I think because of our scale, because of our vertically integrated solution, because of the number of different affiliation programs that we have, we have great flexibility in how we think about our options and alternatives from a pricing standpoint -- and believe that across the aggregate of our different pricing options and alternatives, that we can make most any adjustment, do it in a very competitive way, and most likely turn it into a strategic opportunity. So, I hope that helps, some color. We don't know exactly what that looks like, but that's the discipline, and the framework and the folks that we take with respect to our pricing models. Yes, let me let Matt start with that, and then I'll follow with any color? Yes, and I just might add that I reinforce the -- it's the availability of the products that could give the advisors the necessary flexibility they need to meet their clients' needs. If I'm looking for yield or I'm looking for income, we make it very easily and accessible for them to access those solutions necessary to meet the needs of their clients. We're looking to simplify a client's life and make it very easy to pay for fees or get quick access to some liquidity or to store some cash in-between trades, et cetera, then we have a sweep vehicle that is intended to do that. And I think that's the key to the advisors, is that you give them the necessary flexibility so they can deliver a great experience to the client and have the solutions necessary to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. And we think that our portfolio does a good job of doing that. Hi, Devin. I just would add that our allocations to cash within our centrally managed programs are consistent and the same across all models, whether they're contributed to by LPL research or external third-party management. So, there's a consistent and common structure between -- [technical difficulty] Yes, Devin, and as we look forward or strategically, I think now that we've strengthened and done a good job of aligning with these large OSJs, I think we're more convicted than ever that we can collectively pull through the synergies of our relationships and serve and support advisors really well, which ultimately will contribute to the overall growth of the business. I think we feel great about where we landed and it's work that it needed to be done. And it was done over an extended period of time dating back to 2018. So, I think in working through it, there's some key things that we focused on and solved for. One was making sure that we were well aligned on the value to be delivered by both parties, us and them, refining the policies on how to operate within our ecosystem, and then the legal agreements that helped memorialize all of that. Yes, and I think that's the right structure that gives us the foundation to go forth and work with these folks as a real contributor to growth and hope that helps. Alex, let me start with just maybe how we think about the programs being different and then I'll answer your bigger question around how do we think about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint going forward? So I think, look, as a starting point relative to the differences in the programs, we don't have an affiliated bank or proprietary mutual fund complex. So, we don't have that same structure or potential conflicts of interest. And we certainly have a different monetization program because of that with our cash sweep solution. As they would tend to monetize that business both on the cash sweep as well as potentially through the banks, and then the foundational structure around why we don't have proprietary products and the potential elimination of conflicts associated with essentially also earning asset management fees. So, those are, I think, foundational or big foundational difference, if you will, in our models. Second, those companies' sweep programs potentially are only sort of single-sleeved through their banks, right, and where we have a program that contracts with ultimately third-party banks. And so, we can actually create added benefit with our program through that by having 10 times the amount of FDIC insurance limits, 2.5 million for an individual, 5 million for a joint account is another place where I think there's a fundamental difference in our programs and our platforms from a value standpoint. Additionally, as part of our cash program offerings, we make all of the positional money market funds available to our advisors with a really low entry point of $10,000, and which is less typical in a lot of those, I think, firms that have contemplated moves. And for purchases in an advisory account, there's no ticket charge associated with these movements in and out of the money funds. So, we've tried to make it really easy and accessible to access a money market fund or any other of the alternative cash-like solutions so that these advisors can make sure they're easily meeting the needs of their clients and performing their duty of care. So, that's just some of the high-level places. We're different. It's not meant to be exhaustive. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it gives you a little color. Maybe to your second part of your question, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel good about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint. Now, why do we think that? Maybe a little color around that, if you take and create a framework around the regulatory guidelines, these typically will focus on duty of care obligations, operating control environment, and disclosure requirements. And as such, we regularly review all of these elements to ensure that we're operating within the prescribed requirements and guidelines. So, with respect to duty of care, we regularly review our sweep program and cash investment products to ensure we're meeting both our conduct standards and the needs of our advisors and their clients, and that we provide the flexibility and low barriers to entry in our solutions for investing cash to help our advisors serve and support their clients, and that's what I was just referring to earlier. And that is done consistent with their obligations as advisors. And then, we don't provide incentives for advisors to direct allocations to cash sweep programs. Another important point, I think, with respect to duty of care. Now, with respect to controls, there's any number of controls that we might have, but the one specifically in this area is we actively monitor the levels of cash position within advisory accounts, making sure that advisors are actively managing those accounts and there's not idle cash sitting in there that is not optimized, aligned with the client's goals and objectives for that overall portfolio. And then with respect to controls, I mean, sorry, and then with respect to disclosures, we provide clear and transparent disclosures describing the features and terms of our programs, including the fees we earn relative to the yield clients receive. So, to that end, that's why we feel that our cash offering controls, monetization framework, meet the needs and the expectations of all of the advisors. I know that was a lot, but I'll pause there. Yes, I think, Michael, with respect to the second part of your question, as an ongoing matter around our ongoing reviews with regulators, this is always a part of their review and we've had that consistent and constant discussion with them along the way. And part of the reason we feel very confident in our regulatory positioning today. I think with respect to the first part of your question, first and foremost, when we look at pricing, it's through the strategic lens. And we're always looking to make sure that we do two things. How do we make sure that we're differentiating in the marketplace with our overall sort of holistic value proposition? And then two, is that well aligned with our advisors' needs and their clients' needs? And those are the two biggest drivers that we think about relative to how we might invest, innovate, or evolve our pricing strategies. In the past five years, we've very much focused on advisory and transaction charges because that's sort of where the trend in the business was going. And that's where our advisors really challenged us to focus on and that's what drove that activity. And that's a great example of those two being the real catalyst for how we think about that. I think with respect to any other drivers, I mean, we should always be challenging ourselves to think outside the box. What can we learn from other places, other industries around how they create value, how they price, how they may create new value that extends new revenue streams that then could offset pricing somewhere else? So I think those are all part of how we challenge ourselves from an innovation standpoint to evolve this business model to ultimately enhance its value to the end client and to the advisor. And if we do that really well going forward, we'll create a lot of shareholder value through that. So, the good news is because we're vertically integrated, we have a clearing solution, we're a broker dealer, we're an RIA, we've created lots of services that are down inside the advisor's ecosystem. With that vertical integration, we've got lots of different levers of revenue of which we could think about, hey, where do we innovate to create new levels of revenue? If we wanted to modify or change one level of revenue, we can look at that as an investment back into the business or we can look at it as a, that's a bigger priority for advisors, so we'll offset that with a fee somewhere else. And so, I think that's the sort of the flexibility and the approach that we take in terms of scenario planning and trying to think about how we evolve this pricing again and best in line with serving the advisors in the client. I hope that helps. It's nothing specific, but it at least gives you the sense of how we think about it. That is not our sense. I think there's a pretty tidy and clear regulatory framework of which that we all understand how to operate in. That regulatory framework governs the entire aggregate value proposition and relationships that we have with clients. And again, I think anywhere where there may be a potential conflict within that overall aggregate business model, there's a requirement to disclose and to be clear to set that expectation for the client so that they can make an informed choice. And that's a very logical and very principled way to approach it. And we think when we begin to change principles, it's much, much harder to change that. And so, we don't necessarily see that on the landscape. I will tell you, we're not clairvoyant, so we don't have all the answers, but we're not seeing signs that that would ultimately change from the goal. It's a great question. Yes, so going forward to answer your second part of your question, because of the alignment and the structure we've put around the program, there's very little probability that that would occur. I think back to your first part of your question, we see in some cases where an OSJ may buy up their advisors' practices, turn them into more of an employee-based construct, and ultimately, because of that alignment, that approach, it's more of a captive type of model at that point, which again, is very different from the principles of independence and providing the flexibility for those advisors to move those assets where they want to or go where they want to. I think that's our point. As soon as they begin to lose the principles of independence within the model, we have a hard time with that sitting within our platform and within our ecosystem. So, that's an example of something that I think we were just trying to make sure we had alignment on and teased out, such that as we go forward, that foundational principle is in place across our collective ecosystem. Hope that helps. Sorry, what was the second-half of that? You just broke up a little bit? Sorry, got it. Okay, thank you. Yes, so look, I think that if you look at the marketplace and the growth, call it over the last year or two, it's very much a couple of things happening. The foundation of an annuity as it supports and helps someone with the retirement planning is clearly a relevant problem to be solving for many folks as they think about one of those all-important life goals. And so, it's a relevant solution across a broad opportunity set. And with the rate environment becoming very, very different than the one we lived in for an extended period of time, it has created an opportunity, obviously, to help clients solve for creating that revenue stream or income stream in retirement, and certainly whether it be a fixed or a variable annuities are well positioned to do that as with a steepening yield curve may occur as we go forward. That also is helpful with respect to variable annuities in terms of the features and benefits that they provide. And so, that is obviously something that if you've got more appealing features and benefits relative to the macro, then obviously that's something that can differentiate annuities relative to other options and alternatives. From a seasonality standpoint, I look at it, it's probably more of a product choice in solving a really important need for a broad set of an advisor's clients than necessarily a found opportunity, if you will, to create new asset gathering opportunity because the features are more sound. I think it's ultimately more of a how do you ultimately pick which solution you're going to use to best serve and support the client. So, I don't think it necessarily creates some step down or step up as much as it's just a demonstration of a heavier utilization in a product given the market conditions. That said, as we evolve and grow our number of advisors on our platform, that certainly is a tailwind to the overall volumes of brokerage solutions, or in this case, annuity solutions being done. So, that certainly does provide some tailwind of growth. I hope that helps. Do you want to add anything to that? Yes, and with respect maybe to your second question, just again, as we said in the remarks and as you just said, as a jumping off point, you had recruited assets of $24 billion in Q2 a $93 billion over the trailing 12, which is a solid place for momentum. And we continue to see that momentum into the third quarter. I think we're seeing it across all of our affiliation models. So, you've got good diversification in that opportunity set. That's being driven by this continued evolution of the appeal of our model and then that breadth of market that we serve given the different affiliation models. So, as we look in the third quarter, we certainly see momentum there. And beyond that, given those sort of structural value that we're creating inside the model, our go-to-market strategy and efficacy around how we deliver that to the marketplace, we feel a pretty good, strong structural trend. So, as we look out even further and beyond third quarter, we feel good about that momentum across all of our models. At the same time, we have some built in, as we've talked about institutions, large institutions that have yet to onboard, that collectively represent 66 million in sort of recruited large institutions. So, that certainly is a tailwind to that outlook as well. So, we got really good positioning across all models in your advisor recruiting. And then, on the institution side, you've got that already committed wins in the pipeline. And then, beyond that, we feel good about that evolving and growing pipeline across both large banks as well as insurance services. Hope that helps. Just thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for LPL Financial Holdings Inc. Joining the call today are the President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer and Head of Business Operations; Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks, and then the call will be open to the questions. \n The company would appreciate if analysts would limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up, each. The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, investor.lpl.com.  \n Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL financials, future financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans as well as other opportunities and potential risks of management foresees. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates and beliefs and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or the timing of events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.  \n For more information about such risks and uncertainties, the company refers listeners to the disclosures set forth under the caption Forward-Looking Statements in the earnings press release as well as the risk factors and other disclosures contained in the company's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  \n During the call, the company will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company's earnings release which can be found at investor.lpl.com.  \n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. \nDan Arnold: Thank you, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission: taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their [ clients ].  \n During the first quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to a combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress and helping advisers and institutions solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry.  \n With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $17 billion, representing 5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $96 billion, representing approximately an 8% growth.  \n In the first quarter, recruited assets were $20 billion, which represents a quarterly record, excluding periods when onboarding large institutions. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable markets.  \n Looking at same-store sales. Our advisers remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q1. At the same time, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities in technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the first quarter was approximately 97% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $4.21.  \n Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser center marketplace. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisers can affiliate with us. And to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisers' success throughout the life cycle of the businesses.  \n Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into 2 strategic categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and institutions can affiliate such that we are positioned to compete for all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace.  \n In vertical integration, where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services, to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace to be great operators of their businesses.  \n And with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Now over the first quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $15 billion in assets. At the same time, due to the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $2 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their growth.  \n Next, in Q1, we added approximately $3 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress with the large institution marketplace where we announced that Wintrust Financial will onboard 2 of its wealth management businesses for our institution services plan.  \n And at the same time, we continued our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management business of Prudential Financial. Collectively, these 2 deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025.  \n Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also announced the planned acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions, which supports approximately 2,400 advisers and 150 banks in credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion of [ client assets ]. This transaction will give Atria advisers access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service. We are on track to close the transaction in the back half of this year and complete the conversion in mid-2025.  \n And finally, we're seeing solid momentum with our liquidity and succession solution as demand continues to build with existing LPL advisers while also creating interest with advisers outside our ecosystem, including our first signed external deal in the quarter.  \n Now within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to deliver a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services and technology that help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As a part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. And within that body of work, we are focused on meeting the evolving investment needs of our advisers and their clients, including the increasing interest for nontraditional investment products. To help solve for that demand, we are reimagining the end-to-end experience of our alternatives platform, including enhancing our custodial and operational capabilities for alternative investments, making it simpler and easier to utilize, manage and transact these products.  \n And at the same time, expanding our alternative investment product offer, for over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of products available for advisers to utilize.  \n Another key area within our vertical integration efforts is the continued enhancement of the experience our advisers deliver to their clients. One of the primary ways we do that is providing increased flexibility for advisers to tailor their ideal client experience. For example, we designed Account View, our in-client digital platform, so an adviser can personalize access to features on a client-by-client basis.  \n In addition, we recently launched a series of enhancements to our in-client statement which provides increased flexibility in the channel of delivery and the cadence that clients receive the information, also adding a unique interactive digital experience to further enrich the traditional statement. Our continued work on our services portfolio is also a key area of our vertical integration strategy. And as a reminder, these services help solve for a broad spectrum of advisers and institutions' need, and in doing so, help position them to deliver great advice and be great operators of the businesses. In that spirit, we are developing a number of solutions that help advisers expand the breadth and depth of their advice, including the more effective utilization of financial planning, catering to the more complex needs of high net worth investors and delivering more personalized investment [ search ].  \n For example, as a part of our efforts to enrich our planning capabilities, last year, we introduced our tax planning service, which is seeing strong demand in the market. And more recently, we expanded our high net worth services to enhance our adviser support of their high net worth prospects and clients through complex case design, state planning and investment product analysis. And the early indications have been favorable.  \n Finally, we're in pilot with our latest innovation, our new outsourced Chief Investment Officer service, which provides advisers with personalized investment expertise powered by LPL [ research ]. And based on the initial feedback, this is unlocking additional growth and efficiency in our advisers' practices. Collectively, these services help expand our advisers' value proposition to their clients, enable them to win new prospects, and increase the differentiation of the feel of our platform. \n And as we move forward, we will continue to solve for our advisers' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect businesses for themselves, and ultimately maximize their success.  \n In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. \nMatthew Audette: All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2024, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust.  \n In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, including our first signed deal with an external practice. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Atria Wealth Solutions, which we plan to onboard to our platform in mid-2025. So as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our nearly 23,000 advisers while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.  \n Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $17 billion or approximately a 5% annualized growth rate. Our Q1 recruited assets were $20 billion, which, prior to large institutions, was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting.  \n As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.21. Gross profit was $1.66 billion, up $59 million sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $260 million, up $41 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production bonus. Our payout rate was 86.6%, down 100 basis points from Q4, largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production bonus.  \n With respect to client cash revenue, it was $373 million, down roughly $1 million from Q4. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $46 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by advisory fees paid during the quarter. Outside of those fees, cash balances were flat to Q4.  \n As for our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 323 basis points in Q1, up 6 basis points from Q4. As for Q2, based on our client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points.  \n As for service and fee revenue, it was $132 million in Q1, up $1 million from Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially.  \n Moving on to Q1 transaction, it was $57 million, up $3 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. As we look ahead to Q2, based on typical seasonality and activity levels to date, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by a few million from Q1.  \n Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate core G&A to be in a range of $1.455 billion to $1.490 billion. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria.  \n Moving on to Q1 promotional expense. It was $132 million, down $6 million from Q4 due to lower onboarding costs for large institutions. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting in large institution onboarding as we prepare for Prudential to join us in the fourth quarter.  \n Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $23 million in Q1, up $7 million from Q4. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense to be at a similar level in Q2.\n Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $67 million in Q1, down $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially, which includes technology development for Prudential. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $311 million, up $127 million from Q4. Our leverage ratio was 1.6x flat with Q4. As a reminder, we expect to close our acquisition of Atria in the second half of this year and plan to finance the transaction through a combination of cash and debt.  \n Following the close, we continue to expect leverage to be approximately 2x, near the midpoint of our target leverage range. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.  \n In Q1, we deployed capital across our entire framework as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $70 million of shares in January. We paused share repurchases for the last 2 months of the quarter to ensure we maintain a strong and flexible capital position when we closed on our acquisition of Atria. Following the close expected in the second half of this year, we will evaluate restarting share repurchases consistent with our existing capital frame.  \n In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, operator, please open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. \nDevin Ryan: First question. I just wanted to dig a little bit on recruited assets, had a really nice quarter, up 57% year-over-year, but also a bit stronger than the net new asset trend and maybe that's just a January dynamic. But just want to maybe dig in a little bit about the divergence that you saw this quarter between these 2 metrics. And then more broadly on recruited assets and the outlook, it sounds like you're still seeing a really good recruiting pipeline. So just love to get a little more context on that and kind of what you're seeing between both legacy channels and some of the newer affiliation channels. \nDan Arnold: Yes. So Devin, it's Dan. Let me try to go in maybe a sequential order around those questions that is helpful. So first, maybe let me just tick Q1, I think, organic growth, which I heard inside your question. So during the quarter, we posted 5% organic growth. And given the seasonality we typically see in Q1, we would have expected that to be more like 7%. And while the underlying drivers of the business were strong, there were a couple of things in the quarter that drove the roughly 2% difference.  \n The first was some impact from the timing of onboarding recruiting, which equated to roughly 1% to Q1 organic growth. And that's just really a function of the recruiting, as we mentioned, I think, back in January's call, a lot of it happening in the second half of the quarter. And that gives you a little tailwind going into the second quarter.  \n And then the second thing that we mentioned last quarter as well was that there were 2 acquired practices that departed in January which accounted for a 1% impact to our attrition. So outside of those impacts, which we would categorize as a bit of noise, the underlying drivers that set us up well for the rest of the year remain intact and that's where you were getting at that record level of recruiting. The strongest pipelines that we've had ever historically and our continued low levels of adviser attrition that was consistent with the experience over the last couple of years. So we feel good coming out of the quarter and how we see that opportunity emerge over the remainder of the year. \n I think you mentioned a bit of the -- perhaps some -- how we think about new stores specifically or recruiting going forward, maybe it was second part of your question. And I think, look, we had a really nice quarter, $20 billion in recruited assets. You see significant growth year-on-year across all affiliation models. And at the same time, at expanded addressable market, our increasing win rates, it's driving that deep pipeline that I mentioned as we -- as deep a pipeline as we've seen and certainly is supportive of where we head going forward. And that gives us a really solid conviction that we're well positioned to continue to win a larger share of advisers in motion with respect to recruiting. And I think when you add them to the committed wins we have in the large institution marketplace, that sets up with a solid opportunity with respect to new store sales as we move forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on the quarter and then a little color around the recruiting [ firm ]. \nDevin Ryan: Yes, Dan. Really helpful. And just a follow-up, this is kind of interrelated, but just on the economics of all that. So the theme of competition in the space has continually been coming up. I know it's always a competitive market, so nothing necessarily new. But we look at transition assistance, it's up 6% sequentially, 25% year-over-year. I know that's directionally trending with growth. But can you maybe just talk a little bit about kind of the competitive dynamics and kind of the economics around recruiting and transition assistance? And how you feel like LPL is positioned around kind of those economics, let's say, transition deals or maybe a little bit higher than they have been. \nDan Arnold: Yes. Let me start that and then, Matt, you add any color on economics you think would be helpful. So look, I think with respect to the recruiting environment, right, we always start with the opportunity set. Adviser movement over the last 12 months has hovered around 5%, which remains lower than the historical norms. That said, despite those low overall movement, our win rates continue to move higher. And certainly, that's an encouraging trend relative to how we think about the opportunity set. \n And then two, I think when we think about the environment, we look at the competitive landscape and the participants have remained largely the same. As do the priorities that advisers are looking for when they evaluate their options to potentially move. And as a reminder, the first priorities is around capabilities, technology and service. That's where we continue to further distinguish ourselves as we invest back into our model. \n Next is the ongoing economics, which haven't changed significantly over time. And I think in the independent space, especially create a compelling and interesting scenario for advisers. And then lastly, you get transition assistance rates, which we've seen pretty stable over the last year and feel good about how we're well positioned across our portfolio of different affiliation models in terms of how we support that adviser to make that transition. \n So given all of that, the strength of our overall value proposition continues to resonate, and we remain really confident that the ongoing appeal of our model positions us well to sustain our industry-leading win rates and market share. I don't know, you want to add anything to that, Matt? \nMatthew Audette: I wouldn't not really add to that. I just underscore the point, I think on, Devin, on capabilities is really what matters from a decisioning standpoint on advisers and where they're joining firms. And I think from a TA standpoint, as Dan said, the rates have really been stable for quite a while. I think it's for us and the growth there, it's more about the recruited AUM itself that's coming on board, which I know you see and follow the numbers. But Q1, which is typically the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, bringing in $20 billion prior to any large financial institutions, I think is the driver there. So it's about the level of recruiting. TA rates have been pretty stable. \nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: You guys mentioned liquidity succession a couple of times this afternoon, and it's been coming up in prior calls as well. So maybe level set for us kind of where that business sits today, just maybe in terms of size or AUM, however you want to frame it? And how meaningful do you expect this to be to your organic growth targets, which I guess, continue to be in the high single-digit range in terms of M&A over the next couple of years? \nMatthew Audette: Yes, Alex, I'll start there just on some of the -- maybe the economics and capacity parts of your question. I think we're quite bullish on this offering and the solution. The economics are compelling. And I think from a capacity standpoint, I think there are ultimately limitations on the number of deals we can do in a given year. So if you look at what we've done since we launched the program, it's been 27 to date, I think when we look at our team in capacity and how you bring these practices on board, I think probably max capacity per year, I would think about in the 30 to 40 zone. So then when you put the financial aspects against that from a capital standpoint, we're applying capital consistent with our M&A framework. So they will deploy capital here at about the 6 to 8x EBITDA range. These deals are relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million zone, I would say, skewed towards -- closer to the $10 million side of it. \n And then financially, the economics are pretty attractive in that the ROA of these firms effectively doubles when we purchase them. So if you're in the thick of the 30 basis point zone, we'd be earning 60 basis points once we own the practice. And that's largely a function of the reduced payout to advisers. So that's where you would see those economics show up. \n So those are the economics. So I think it's really financially compelling, but I think maybe even more exciting or more compelling is really the strategic value of this solution. Maybe, Dan, may be better, if you want to jump in there? \nDan Arnold: [indiscernible]. \nAlexander Blostein: Dan, I'm sorry, I don't think we could hear you, unfortunately. I don't know if it's my phone or maybe other people are having the same issue. \nDan Arnold: It was user error on my part. Sorry about that. So let me start over. And again, I think as we've discussed before, our opportunity set is really driven by trying to solve that big strategic question of how do we help potentially as many as 1/3 advisers retire and transition their businesses over the next 10 years. And while there are a variety of options that are available in the marketplace, we think ours is really differentiated and a compelling one in a very elegant way to help these advisers transition their practices to take care of them, to take care of their team, to take care of their clients and ultimately create a bridge to the next entrepreneurial leader or owner. \n And in that spirit, I think since we've rolled it out to our advisers, it's been -- which was late in 2022, it's been very, very appealing for those that are exposed to those possibilities. And as Matt said, we closed roughly 27 deals to date. And given the success with our existing advisers, now we've extended the question to the external marketplace and in the fourth quarter, began to explore how we could help those advisers that are on the LPL platform with the same type of solution to that big question of how do they transition their practices. And as we mentioned, we were fortunate enough to close our first deal in Q1, and we've got a pretty solid pipeline building there. \n So I think we see it as this multidimensional opportunity of supporting and helping our existing advisers which extend those assets on our platform for another generation of advisers and then, two, also, as a catalyst for growth to complement the other opportunities that we focus on and have to drive growth. And we think it's a compelling differentiated solution. A little hard to replicate. So we think it will resonate in the external market. I hope that helps. \nAlexander Blostein: Great. No, that's very helpful. So my second question, kind of related, I guess, to some of the new initiatives. You guys have been super busy in the last few months with a number of deals, [ H3 ] obviously being on the larger size. How should we think about the capacity for incremental M&A, call it, over the next 12 months as we're sort of waiting for H3 close? And then obviously, you guys have to integrate it. And then as part of this H3 conversation, maybe you can hit on the competitive dynamics in the bank channel post this deal, given that we're a pretty sizable player there. \nDan Arnold: Yes. So I think -- listen, relative to onboarding these programs and making sure that we have the ability to support and scale them, I think it is something that we've been working on since the good fortune of onboarding some of the larger financial institutions, BMO and M&T in 2021. And so our guiding principle when we explore any growth initiative, whether it's organic win, like large institutions or even an acquisition like Atria is to ensure that we're going to continue to deliver an exceptional experience to our existing advisers and that then we provide a seamless transition for advisers that are joining our platform. And in that spirit, we've continued to evolve our transition approach because we've iterated, we've improved and gotten a lot better over the last few years. We established a disciplined operating rigor. We use seasoned run books and automation, all in the spirit of delivering a high-quality successful outcomes that are repeatable and sustainable. And with each iteration, as I mentioned, we continue to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of how we execute the onboarding process. \n Now the important part about that is that certainly then improves and enhances the quality that we deliver but also the pace at which we can deliver these. And I think as we continue to go forward with each iteration, we adopt new ideas, new concepts, new ways of which to do them in a simpler and faster way, and we'll continue to work on that and iterate that I think will help us know and deliver an industry-leading onboarding experience but do it in the simplest and fastest way possible in the market place. So that's sort of the context of how we think about increasing the capacity to support that ongoing opportunity. \n I think -- and then your second question, remind me what it was. \nAlexander Blostein: Sorry. Just the competitive positioning in the bank's channel, institution's channel after you guys integrate Atria because they're a sizable player there, and now you have obviously more presence in that channel with them eventually under your umbrella. \nDan Arnold: Yes. So again, I think we've seen that marketplace as sort of an emerging opportunity where we took a novel concept back in 2020 as we began to offer it to the marketplace and establish a significant advantage from just having market share developing and growing IP around how to support and serve those clients. And then ultimately, continuing to evolve our capability set to make sure that we can help them in terms of their risk profile or cluster around this business line or service, increase or enhance financial results or manage the performance of their programs to create operational efficiency and scalability into their programs and then ultimately, to support them with growth. If we can do that within this value proposition and then have the advantage of the history and the experience of operating and working with these clients, the better practice at onboarding through the change management. A very complex effort. But that gives us a distinctive disadvantage in the marketplace that we think really resonates when we go out and share that with any prospective new clients. \n So I think we feel great about our positioning in the marketplace, the insights and perspective that we've been bringing forward that have enriched our value proposition that again, it's hard to do if you hadn't had the experience from doing so. That's how we think about that leadership. We think it's pretty durable and an interesting ongoing growth opportunity. \nOperator: And our next question is come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start with a follow-up on just the liquidity and succession discussion. Matt, you alluded to some of the limitations on the pace of deployment. But I was hoping you could just speak to the cadence now that this has been launched externally that we should be contemplating. And given the higher year-on-year payout ratio guide for 2Q, when should we expect to see those reductions in the adviser payout rate as some of that liquidity and succession accretion really starts to come through? \nMatthew Audette: I think on -- so on that last point, right? I think when you look at the payout, there's a handful of things going on. But I think you're already seeing it within the payout rate just based on the 27 deals we've done so far. So maybe, if you just looked at payout rate year-over-year for Q1, so just to eliminate kind of seasonal production build. And as a reminder, the Q1 payout for last year had a 40 basis point kind of catch-up onetimer. So overall, payout was flat year-over-year. \n And there are 2 things in there that actually drove out up a little bit. The first is, and kind of building on what Dan was just talking through, the institutions channel and the growth in the institutional channel, which I think you know has a much higher payout than the average, also has a much lower cost to serve, lower TA rates. When you get down to things, bottom line economics like up margins quite compelling. But if you're just looking at the payout rate, you're going to see that grow as that business grows. \n And then we had some pricing reductions or pricing investments on our corporate advisory platform. We had announced those last year. Those took effect on the first quarter. So had those 2 things, that [ bias ] payout up. But then liquidity and succession did drive payout down to offset that. So there are moving parts in there, but you are absolutely starting to see that show up in the payout rate. Maybe not on an individual quarter-to-quarter just given the size of our overall business, but you are starting to see that over time. \n I think on the capacity point, and not sure where you're specifically doing that. So maybe just a follow up if we're not hitting that. But I think overall, when you look at whether it's internal or external, and you think through the process to onboard these teams, make sure we're putting the proper field management in place, all the complexities associated with it, that's really where the 30 to 40 deals per year comes from just to make sure that we're bringing those on board in a way that really delivers the strategic value that Dan was describing earlier. \nSteven Chubak: Really helpful color, Matt. And for my follow-up, just a question on cash levels and expectations around reinvestment, just given the significant number of fixed-rate contracts coming due, I believe, roughly $6 billion over the next 3 quarters. Where are those fixed contracts going to get renewed relative to that 240 basis point back book? And should we expect that that's all going to be renewed in fixed rate contracts, given that we are starting to see some signs of cash stabilization? \nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean I think on the plans to renew, I think we like being in the center of that range, that 50% to 75% range, which is where we are now. So we'll make decisions and judgments about that. But I think with a stable cash balance and being at 65%, I think it's a fair assumption to assume our plans would be to renew. \n When you look, maybe just to look at the next quarter, so not have to go too far out, the maturities, that $2 billion of maturities are towards the end of next quarter and those specifically are at 200 basis points right now. So they're kind of below that average for the year. And if you look at where we would typically place in the 3- to 5-year range, where that marketplace is, I think in today's market, you can assume in the 450 basis point range is where we place those. So of course, things can move between now and the end of Q2. But where we're sitting right now, you'd be going from 200 basis points up to the mid-450s on that $2 billion. \nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just circling back to the enterprise channel. You guys have had a lot of success there over the past couple of years. I'm just hoping you could talk a little bit about the pipeline for new mandates, how those conversations are evolving. And then on the Pru platform, more broadly on that. I was hoping maybe you could speak a little bit to the platform that you've customized and built for Pru, just how that differs from what you've done with other enterprise clients and how you might be able to take the sort of capability set into other channels or markets over time? \nDan Arnold: Yes. So with respect to the institution pipeline, we have continued opportunity to get swings in the batter's box in the large bank space. Obviously, we've had established a series of a number of years of success in bringing those clients on and a success that those institutions are having once on the platform from a financial performance standpoint, from new capabilities and solutions and features, I think certainly reinforces the value that the model can provide them and thus helps us in those ongoing dialogues with other opportunities within the bank space. That's about a $1 trillion opportunity or a marketplace. And so there's a number of opportunities that remain out there, and we're encouraged by the dialogue we're having in that part of the marketplace. \n And then I think also with the win with Pru, right, we expanded that market to include kind of wealth management solutions that are owned or operated by audit manufacturers and specifically insurance companies. And I think that's -- certainly that win created the opportunity to have a number of dialogues that companies that are similar in nature to a Prudential and certainly exploring the possibility of outsourcing, where an outsourcing solution wasn't always available in that part of the marketplace. And so a longer sales cycle and sort of longer iterative consultative approach to that. We are encouraged by the emerging dialogue and discussions we're having in that part of the markets. \n I think that's your first question. Your second one, ask again, please? \nMichael Cyprys: Sorry, the first part was just on the pipeline for new mandates and conversations. And then the second part was just around the Pru custom-built platform and opportunities to take that elsewhere to other markets or channels over time. \nDan Arnold: Yes. Thank you. Sorry. So I think I answered the first one. So on the second half, with respect to some of the capabilities that we're thinking about relative to Pru, part of the opportunity in exploring that and solving for that was I think creating what I think are 2 interesting applications that are somewhat novel in the marketplace today. The first one is the expansion of our platform that will enable the audit manufacturer and the LPL suite of products to exist in a single experience. \n And if you think about that relative to insurance, as an example, that can be a really important element and differentiator where you get a really seamless integrated solution set across your entire product offering in. Again, that's kind of a novel concept and a hypothesis of a lot of folks thinking, wow, that would be a really interesting thing to solve for and I think inside this opportunity, we're solving for that. So we're really encouraged about that. And again, once you do that, that can be valuable to any a number of other different larger institutions that might value that. \n Second one would be an integrated operating platform that embeds workflows and connectivity, not only through our systems, but to the parent and third-party systems. And so it's kind of a cool operational efficiency, again, across the landscape of business they do, that makes it easy for them to collaborate, operate and work with us in a very integrated way. So those are just 2 [ different sets. ] I think we think are really, again, interesting and differentiating them but also applicable to other potential prospects. I hope that helps. Thanks. \nMichael Cyprys: Just a follow-up question, if I could, just on client cash. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of underlying client behavior. I realize the cash allocation a bit lower today versus historical. But when you look at the customer behavioral trends under the hood with cash going in and out of the account, just curious if there's anything different now that you're seeing relative to historical. And as you kind of look out from here, is there a certain macro or rate environment that you think would be helpful in terms of catalyzing cash allocations to [indiscernible]? \nMatthew Audette: Michael, yes, I think -- I mean, the headline is -- and I think you can see it in our metrics. I think we've seen stability in the category of near full deployment for quite some time now, right? Look at Q1 results and cash balances kind of remained in that just above 3% zone, largely coming down just by fees in the quarter. So I think you're starting to get to that place where you're really at full deployment. And I think from an environment standpoint, and where things could go, I think history is the best guide. I think we're in a place where clients are fully deployed, the equity markets are rising. Interest rates are high, and they're fully deployed in the market. And I think when we've seen environments that are the opposite of that, where they're in more of a defensive position, you see cash balances come back up, right? That doesn't feel like that, of course, in the moment, but I think that is the behavior we've seen time and time again. And I think that's the dynamic we would expect to continue. \n All that being said, I'd just emphasize, we are seeing that stability where cash is really coming down for things like paying fees and things as opposed to deployment in the marketplace has gotten pretty stable in the last quarter or so. \nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: Matt, was hoping you could talk to the factors that are going to get us -- or get you towards the low or the high end of your G&A growth for this year and now that we're 4 months in, kind of where you think you're tracking based upon current trends. \nMatthew Audette: Yes. I mean, I think when you look at just the first quarter, right, from an annualized rate, we're at the low end of that guidance. And I think when you look ahead to Q2 would probably be something in a similar zone. So I think we're -- we feel good that we are tracking towards our guidance overall. I think the things that can move us within that range are similar to things that are in the prior years, which is more about our levels of organic growth, opportunities that we see during the year that really drive, whether it be variable cost, variable compensation, or the costs associated with that growth. \n But the headline I would give is, we feel comfortable of landing within that zone. And just a reminder, that is prior to expenses associated with Pru and Atria and to the extent that those impact core G&A, we'll give updates later in the year on that. The headline is we feel good. \nDaniel Fannon: Understood. And then, Dan, I was hoping you could provide some updated thoughts around the DOL rule. Obviously, we got the full proposal last week. Any changes to how you were thinking about it and what you said previously? \nDan Arnold: Yes. So as we said, it's been a hot topic over the last week since the release. But look, the headline is that I think the final rule reflects some hopeful changes from the original proposal and generally better aligns with the SEC's Reg BI, which we believe is a good thing for investors. And as you probably have seen, the rules is scheduled to become effective in September, although there is a 1-year transition period for firms that acknowledge [ fiduciary established ] and comply with specified conduct standards. So that's probably a long-winded way to say. There's probably a year time line in and around getting any changes that need to be required or made in your compliance programs in place such that you can build those new responsibilities. \n That said, our team is working to finalize the design and implementation of our compliance program. And again, we feel good about that preparation and the ability to execute around the effective framework -- effective dates and framework that we've seen thus far. We're able to leverage some of the work we did in 2016, which ultimately wasn't implemented, in addition to some work that we've already done connected to Reg BI. So at the same time, there are a few areas like around rollovers where we'll have to deploy new approaches and solutions, again, we can come -- they're solvable for us. \n All that said, it's safe to assume that there will be litigation challenging the rule as there was a case with successful litigation we saw back in response to the 2016. All of that could potentially impact both the compliance approach that any of us take in the time line. So we draw out on that, but we do think it was a better landing spot than originally. \nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. \nWilliam Katz: So just coming back to cash for a moment. To the extent that we follow the forward curve from here, and I appreciate your comments, Matt, that there's some cyclicality longer looking on this. But just sort of using your current AUM base, even if I sort of apply an 8% growth rate against that and sort of assume a 3% allocation and I adjust for quarterly billings, should we be thinking of a scenario of sort of flatter client cash here until a more strident change of interest rates as we sort of think of through our models? \nMatthew Audette: Well, I think -- yes, you're walking through your model there, Bill. I think the headline point is if you're assuming the environment remains the same, I think assuming cash is fully deployed in the market, I think, is a good assumption. I think the -- I think the point you're making is we continue to grow, that growth does come with cash. So I think modeling that versus the fees we pay and things of that nature, I think is a good way to look at it. And maybe the bottom line, I think when you look at the cash as a percent of AUM, where we are in that low kind of 3% zone, you're certainly getting to the point of friction from going below that when you've got to have a certain amount of cash to manage rebalancing, paying fees, facilitating withdrawals or just a natural resistance when you get down to the levels that we are. \n So I think that was where you were probing, but those levels would be what makes sense to us, and there's certainly cash that comes along with growth, if that's what you're trying to confirm. \nWilliam Katz: Okay. That's helpful. And then just 1 clarification and 1 question. You mentioned that your ICA yield might be down a couple of basis points quarter-on-quarter. And I guess, I'm a little surprised just given the high reinvestment rates and you're getting more favorable gross spread on the Fed fund on the variable side. So can you just maybe explain that? The broader question I have is going on to just the liquidity and services opportunity -- success, excuse me. Can you talk a little bit about, maybe the external one, Dan, you sort of highlighted that you sort of secured the first one, so congrats on that. What's the same size of that look like? And then just from a devil's advocate perspective, if you're getting 60 basis points on that incremental deployment, why not ratchet that up and slow some of the lower gross profit ROA, larger transactions in the enterprise side? Maybe help me understand the puts and takes as you think about allocation. \nMatthew Audette: All right. Well, I'll start with part one of your 7-part question there. I think on the ICA yield, just the timing. So I think when you look at the decline quarter-over-quarter, the fixed-rate maturity that I think we would reinvest at from 200 basis points to 450, that comes at the very end of the quarter. So if you just look at where cash balances are at the moment, you would just have a movement of those variable ones. I think the point I would hit is that truly that maturity, just coming at the end of the quarter. So you'll see that benefit pull through assuming it comes in at the rates that we talk through, they're in the marketplace right now. You just see that come through in the third quarter. \n I think on the L&S economics, maybe I'll just give a comment there and then turn it over to Dan. I think it's not necessarily about pure decisions on capital allocation where to put it. I think it's about these advisers in finding a succession offering that works for them and doing it in a way that is very thoughtful and helpful and lands them on our platform and really hits the marks of the really strategic benefits of the transaction itself. And I think that's what leads to our thoughts on the capacity of 30 to 40 a year, as opposed to just some financial choice. And maybe, Dan, if there's anything you want to add to that. \nDan Arnold: Yes. So Bill, you were speaking to the opportunity set. Again, it goes back to, in many cases, what we're solving for is the succession for these advisers. And I think given the size of that need has driven the proliferation of maybe innovation in that area to try to solve for it. And so if it's -- there's 300,000 advisers in the marketplace and 1/3 of them are going to retire over the next 10 years, that would be a total opportunity set. \n I think, for now, a lot of these transactions have been targeted for larger practices because to do these transactions, it's just -- it could be a complex administrative process to work through it. And so it's probably not fair to say then it's all 100,000 that are retiring in the next 10 years as the opportunity set. \n That said, the constraints around the administrative complexity to do these deals will certainly get easier as everyone in the marketplace learns, iterates, evolves on how to do that. And that constraint then will allow that capacity to go up. And as firms learn how to onboard these folks and do it in a highly successful way, then again, I think that constraint will go up and you'll see increased number and sizes of these over time. And so that's how we think at least about how we think about the opportunity set and make sure that we have a compelling value proposition to support these folks once they transition over. And once we serve them in the context and the capacity that they are being served in as an employee of LPL and thus as part of a transition of the succession plan over the 5-year period of time, we're delivering value and capabilities that we've built in a lot of our affiliation models that enable us to do that really in an efficient and effective way. \n And so we can scale that where we couldn't have if we didn't have the 3 or 4 years of experience in building those capabilities. And so I think it's just that front-end administrative operational work for doing these deals, and those again, we can get more efficient at them, we'll scale that up. We do think, again, it's compelling opportunity that is some relevant for folks that are in traditional employee-based models. It's relevant for anyone that has their own independent business, just trying to explore how to transition the business and create a succession outcome that's good for them. So it is a relevant business across the -- sorry, a relevant opportunity across the industry, and again, I think we'll continue to innovate, evolve and get better and better at it. I suspect we'll have competition out in the marketplace because it's a big problem to solve. But we think we've got a good head start and good infrastructure of which to leverage and scale. \nOperator: And our last question is going to come from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to -- first maybe, 1 more follow-up on cash levels, but maybe asking about the April update more holistically. So on cash, it sort of sounds like your comment about the variable piece moving with given the timing of adviser payments and taxes, perhaps cash continues to decline in April, but you also sound quite optimistic on the recruiting pipeline. Any color you can give in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of net new assets in April? I know the month is almost at an end. \nMatthew Audette: Yes, you bet. I mean, I think we've got 1 more day of data to see. But the headline I'd give you on April is,it's shaping up, be a bit better than you would expect, especially given the seasonality that you hinted at in your question of what you see in April. \n So starting first on client cash balances. The 2 seasonal factors that do hit April are, first, to your point, taxes, right, taxes get paid in April. That for us typically reduces cash by about $1.5 billion. And then the second factor is advisory fees. Those primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, April, obviously, being the first month of Q2. That reduces cash by about $1 billion a quarter. So those 2 seasonal factors together, all else equal would drive a decline of nearly $3 billion in cash sweep for the month. \n But to the point on stability outside of those factors, we actually have seen cash balances grow by over $1 billion. So you net it all out, and cash balances for the month of April are down just $1.5 billion where we sit right now. And then to your point on organic growth. We're continuing to see the strength that we've talked about in Q1. Those same dynamics, taxes and advisory fees do hit NNA in the month of April. That would -- so it would reduce NNA by about $3 billion or about 3%. But outside of that, when you factor in the recruiting levels that we've had that have -- that ramp -- that's come into April as well as we continue to see from a strength in the month of April, we're seeing organic growth in the 5% to 6% zone which, as a reminder, April is typically the slowest month of the year from a growth standpoint. So at 5% to 6% for that month, I think it's a solid start to the quarter. \nBenjamin Budish: Great. And then my follow-up. Just in terms of promotional expenses, I guess 2 questions. One, can you unpack a little bit the prudential related expenses? I guess, how much was in Q1? And then for the step-up you indicated in Q2, how much are you expecting that's Pru specific versus the increase in the TA side? \n And then at a high level, can you kind of just walk us through what happens over the next, like, year, say, with Prudential and Atria, Prudential, I understand there are promo expenses coming off. For Atria, presumably, there's separate M&A spend, but TA, should be ramping up. So how are you thinking about the growth in that line over the next, say, 4 quarters? \nMatthew Audette: Yes. You bet. Matt, I think when you look at specific to Q1 and Pru, we had about $17 million of promo-related expense related to Pru in Q1. We'd actually expected it in a low $20 million range. It's a little bit why promotional came in a little bit better than we had guided and the reason why next quarter is up by about $10 million. It's really a shifting of the timing of spend related to Pru. \n I think when you look at the overall year to your question on what's going to drive promotional, and I'll get to the Pru specific pieces of that. But I think there's really 3 factors when you look at the full year. And the first in Q1 is organic growth, right, it's in specifically from recruiting that we talked a little bit about earlier in the call, primarily the level and amount of recruited AUM that comes on to the platform with Q1 had a record prior to large financial institutions. The good momentum we have going into Q2, I think we feel like that will be a key driver of promotional expense going up this year for a very good reason that it's the recruited assets coming on the platform, with TA rates really stable. \n The other item is our conference spend, right? So that is really in line with the size and the table of the firm. Our conferences are where we get together, we connect with our advisers. They're really important, really valuable, and we would scale that with the size of the firm. \n And then lastly, to deploy in your question on Prudential. Atria really wouldn't impact Prudential this year. But Prudential would. And just as a reminder, for that deal overall, we estimate $325 million of spend to bring them on. $200 million of that is in technology spend that Dan gave a little bit of color on earlier. And then the other $125 million is really onboarding integration costs. That's what shows up in promotional. We've incurred a little over $40 million so far through the first quarter. So the remaining $80 million to $85 million, that will primarily come through in the remainder of this year. So those are the drivers. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a double click on Prudential itself. \nOperator: And I would now like to hand the conference back to Dan Arnold for any closing remarks. \nDan Arnold: Yes. I just want to thank everyone for making the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Audette",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2024, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust.  \n In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, including our first signed deal with an external practice. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Atria Wealth Solutions, which we plan to onboard to our platform in mid-2025. So as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our nearly 23,000 advisers while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.  \n Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $17 billion or approximately a 5% annualized growth rate. Our Q1 recruited assets were $20 billion, which, prior to large institutions, was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting.  \n As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.21. Gross profit was $1.66 billion, up $59 million sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $260 million, up $41 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production bonus. Our payout rate was 86.6%, down 100 basis points from Q4, largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production bonus.  \n With respect to client cash revenue, it was $373 million, down roughly $1 million from Q4. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $46 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by advisory fees paid during the quarter. Outside of those fees, cash balances were flat to Q4.  \n As for our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 323 basis points in Q1, up 6 basis points from Q4. As for Q2, based on our client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points.  \n As for service and fee revenue, it was $132 million in Q1, up $1 million from Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially.  \n Moving on to Q1 transaction, it was $57 million, up $3 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. As we look ahead to Q2, based on typical seasonality and activity levels to date, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by a few million from Q1.  \n Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate core G&A to be in a range of $1.455 billion to $1.490 billion. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria.  \n Moving on to Q1 promotional expense. It was $132 million, down $6 million from Q4 due to lower onboarding costs for large institutions. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting in large institution onboarding as we prepare for Prudential to join us in the fourth quarter.  \n Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $23 million in Q1, up $7 million from Q4. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense to be at a similar level in Q2.\n Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $67 million in Q1, down $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially, which includes technology development for Prudential. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $311 million, up $127 million from Q4. Our leverage ratio was 1.6x flat with Q4. As a reminder, we expect to close our acquisition of Atria in the second half of this year and plan to finance the transaction through a combination of cash and debt.  \n Following the close, we continue to expect leverage to be approximately 2x, near the midpoint of our target leverage range. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.  \n In Q1, we deployed capital across our entire framework as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $70 million of shares in January. We paused share repurchases for the last 2 months of the quarter to ensure we maintain a strong and flexible capital position when we closed on our acquisition of Atria. Following the close expected in the second half of this year, we will evaluate restarting share repurchases consistent with our existing capital frame.  \n In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, operator, please open the call for questions. I wouldn't not really add to that. I just underscore the point, I think on, Devin, on capabilities is really what matters from a decisioning standpoint on advisers and where they're joining firms. And I think from a TA standpoint, as Dan said, the rates have really been stable for quite a while. I think it's for us and the growth there, it's more about the recruited AUM itself that's coming on board, which I know you see and follow the numbers. But Q1, which is typically the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, bringing in $20 billion prior to any large financial institutions, I think is the driver there. So it's about the level of recruiting. TA rates have been pretty stable. Yes, Alex, I'll start there just on some of the -- maybe the economics and capacity parts of your question. I think we're quite bullish on this offering and the solution. The economics are compelling. And I think from a capacity standpoint, I think there are ultimately limitations on the number of deals we can do in a given year. So if you look at what we've done since we launched the program, it's been 27 to date, I think when we look at our team in capacity and how you bring these practices on board, I think probably max capacity per year, I would think about in the 30 to 40 zone. So then when you put the financial aspects against that from a capital standpoint, we're applying capital consistent with our M&A framework. So they will deploy capital here at about the 6 to 8x EBITDA range. These deals are relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million zone, I would say, skewed towards -- closer to the $10 million side of it. \n And then financially, the economics are pretty attractive in that the ROA of these firms effectively doubles when we purchase them. So if you're in the thick of the 30 basis point zone, we'd be earning 60 basis points once we own the practice. And that's largely a function of the reduced payout to advisers. So that's where you would see those economics show up. \n So those are the economics. So I think it's really financially compelling, but I think maybe even more exciting or more compelling is really the strategic value of this solution. Maybe, Dan, may be better, if you want to jump in there? I think on -- so on that last point, right? I think when you look at the payout, there's a handful of things going on. But I think you're already seeing it within the payout rate just based on the 27 deals we've done so far. So maybe, if you just looked at payout rate year-over-year for Q1, so just to eliminate kind of seasonal production build. And as a reminder, the Q1 payout for last year had a 40 basis point kind of catch-up onetimer. So overall, payout was flat year-over-year. \n And there are 2 things in there that actually drove out up a little bit. The first is, and kind of building on what Dan was just talking through, the institutions channel and the growth in the institutional channel, which I think you know has a much higher payout than the average, also has a much lower cost to serve, lower TA rates. When you get down to things, bottom line economics like up margins quite compelling. But if you're just looking at the payout rate, you're going to see that grow as that business grows. \n And then we had some pricing reductions or pricing investments on our corporate advisory platform. We had announced those last year. Those took effect on the first quarter. So had those 2 things, that [ bias ] payout up. But then liquidity and succession did drive payout down to offset that. So there are moving parts in there, but you are absolutely starting to see that show up in the payout rate. Maybe not on an individual quarter-to-quarter just given the size of our overall business, but you are starting to see that over time. \n I think on the capacity point, and not sure where you're specifically doing that. So maybe just a follow up if we're not hitting that. But I think overall, when you look at whether it's internal or external, and you think through the process to onboard these teams, make sure we're putting the proper field management in place, all the complexities associated with it, that's really where the 30 to 40 deals per year comes from just to make sure that we're bringing those on board in a way that really delivers the strategic value that Dan was describing earlier. Yes. I mean I think on the plans to renew, I think we like being in the center of that range, that 50% to 75% range, which is where we are now. So we'll make decisions and judgments about that. But I think with a stable cash balance and being at 65%, I think it's a fair assumption to assume our plans would be to renew. \n When you look, maybe just to look at the next quarter, so not have to go too far out, the maturities, that $2 billion of maturities are towards the end of next quarter and those specifically are at 200 basis points right now. So they're kind of below that average for the year. And if you look at where we would typically place in the 3- to 5-year range, where that marketplace is, I think in today's market, you can assume in the 450 basis point range is where we place those. So of course, things can move between now and the end of Q2. But where we're sitting right now, you'd be going from 200 basis points up to the mid-450s on that $2 billion. Michael, yes, I think -- I mean, the headline is -- and I think you can see it in our metrics. I think we've seen stability in the category of near full deployment for quite some time now, right? Look at Q1 results and cash balances kind of remained in that just above 3% zone, largely coming down just by fees in the quarter. So I think you're starting to get to that place where you're really at full deployment. And I think from an environment standpoint, and where things could go, I think history is the best guide. I think we're in a place where clients are fully deployed, the equity markets are rising. Interest rates are high, and they're fully deployed in the market. And I think when we've seen environments that are the opposite of that, where they're in more of a defensive position, you see cash balances come back up, right? That doesn't feel like that, of course, in the moment, but I think that is the behavior we've seen time and time again. And I think that's the dynamic we would expect to continue. \n All that being said, I'd just emphasize, we are seeing that stability where cash is really coming down for things like paying fees and things as opposed to deployment in the marketplace has gotten pretty stable in the last quarter or so. Yes. I mean, I think when you look at just the first quarter, right, from an annualized rate, we're at the low end of that guidance. And I think when you look ahead to Q2 would probably be something in a similar zone. So I think we're -- we feel good that we are tracking towards our guidance overall. I think the things that can move us within that range are similar to things that are in the prior years, which is more about our levels of organic growth, opportunities that we see during the year that really drive, whether it be variable cost, variable compensation, or the costs associated with that growth. \n But the headline I would give is, we feel comfortable of landing within that zone. And just a reminder, that is prior to expenses associated with Pru and Atria and to the extent that those impact core G&A, we'll give updates later in the year on that. The headline is we feel good. Well, I think -- yes, you're walking through your model there, Bill. I think the headline point is if you're assuming the environment remains the same, I think assuming cash is fully deployed in the market, I think, is a good assumption. I think the -- I think the point you're making is we continue to grow, that growth does come with cash. So I think modeling that versus the fees we pay and things of that nature, I think is a good way to look at it. And maybe the bottom line, I think when you look at the cash as a percent of AUM, where we are in that low kind of 3% zone, you're certainly getting to the point of friction from going below that when you've got to have a certain amount of cash to manage rebalancing, paying fees, facilitating withdrawals or just a natural resistance when you get down to the levels that we are. \n So I think that was where you were probing, but those levels would be what makes sense to us, and there's certainly cash that comes along with growth, if that's what you're trying to confirm. All right. Well, I'll start with part one of your 7-part question there. I think on the ICA yield, just the timing. So I think when you look at the decline quarter-over-quarter, the fixed-rate maturity that I think we would reinvest at from 200 basis points to 450, that comes at the very end of the quarter. So if you just look at where cash balances are at the moment, you would just have a movement of those variable ones. I think the point I would hit is that truly that maturity, just coming at the end of the quarter. So you'll see that benefit pull through assuming it comes in at the rates that we talk through, they're in the marketplace right now. You just see that come through in the third quarter. \n I think on the L&S economics, maybe I'll just give a comment there and then turn it over to Dan. I think it's not necessarily about pure decisions on capital allocation where to put it. I think it's about these advisers in finding a succession offering that works for them and doing it in a way that is very thoughtful and helpful and lands them on our platform and really hits the marks of the really strategic benefits of the transaction itself. And I think that's what leads to our thoughts on the capacity of 30 to 40 a year, as opposed to just some financial choice. And maybe, Dan, if there's anything you want to add to that. Yes, you bet. I mean, I think we've got 1 more day of data to see. But the headline I'd give you on April is,it's shaping up, be a bit better than you would expect, especially given the seasonality that you hinted at in your question of what you see in April. \n So starting first on client cash balances. The 2 seasonal factors that do hit April are, first, to your point, taxes, right, taxes get paid in April. That for us typically reduces cash by about $1.5 billion. And then the second factor is advisory fees. Those primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, April, obviously, being the first month of Q2. That reduces cash by about $1 billion a quarter. So those 2 seasonal factors together, all else equal would drive a decline of nearly $3 billion in cash sweep for the month. \n But to the point on stability outside of those factors, we actually have seen cash balances grow by over $1 billion. So you net it all out, and cash balances for the month of April are down just $1.5 billion where we sit right now. And then to your point on organic growth. We're continuing to see the strength that we've talked about in Q1. Those same dynamics, taxes and advisory fees do hit NNA in the month of April. That would -- so it would reduce NNA by about $3 billion or about 3%. But outside of that, when you factor in the recruiting levels that we've had that have -- that ramp -- that's come into April as well as we continue to see from a strength in the month of April, we're seeing organic growth in the 5% to 6% zone which, as a reminder, April is typically the slowest month of the year from a growth standpoint. So at 5% to 6% for that month, I think it's a solid start to the quarter. Yes. You bet. Matt, I think when you look at specific to Q1 and Pru, we had about $17 million of promo-related expense related to Pru in Q1. We'd actually expected it in a low $20 million range. It's a little bit why promotional came in a little bit better than we had guided and the reason why next quarter is up by about $10 million. It's really a shifting of the timing of spend related to Pru. \n I think when you look at the overall year to your question on what's going to drive promotional, and I'll get to the Pru specific pieces of that. But I think there's really 3 factors when you look at the full year. And the first in Q1 is organic growth, right, it's in specifically from recruiting that we talked a little bit about earlier in the call, primarily the level and amount of recruited AUM that comes on to the platform with Q1 had a record prior to large financial institutions. The good momentum we have going into Q2, I think we feel like that will be a key driver of promotional expense going up this year for a very good reason that it's the recruited assets coming on the platform, with TA rates really stable. \n The other item is our conference spend, right? So that is really in line with the size and the table of the firm. Our conferences are where we get together, we connect with our advisers. They're really important, really valuable, and we would scale that with the size of the firm. \n And then lastly, to deploy in your question on Prudential. Atria really wouldn't impact Prudential this year. But Prudential would. And just as a reminder, for that deal overall, we estimate $325 million of spend to bring them on. $200 million of that is in technology spend that Dan gave a little bit of color on earlier. And then the other $125 million is really onboarding integration costs. That's what shows up in promotional. We've incurred a little over $40 million so far through the first quarter. So the remaining $80 million to $85 million, that will primarily come through in the remainder of this year. So those are the drivers. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a double click on Prudential itself."

            "name": "Dan Arnold",
            "content": "Thank you, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission: taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their [ clients ].  \n During the first quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to a combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model, and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress and helping advisers and institutions solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry.  \n With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $17 billion, representing 5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $96 billion, representing approximately an 8% growth.  \n In the first quarter, recruited assets were $20 billion, which represents a quarterly record, excluding periods when onboarding large institutions. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable markets.  \n Looking at same-store sales. Our advisers remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q1. At the same time, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities in technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the first quarter was approximately 97% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $4.21.  \n Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser center marketplace. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisers can affiliate with us. And to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisers' success throughout the life cycle of the businesses.  \n Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into 2 strategic categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and institutions can affiliate such that we are positioned to compete for all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace.  \n In vertical integration, where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services, to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace to be great operators of their businesses.  \n And with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Now over the first quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $15 billion in assets. At the same time, due to the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $2 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their growth.  \n Next, in Q1, we added approximately $3 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress with the large institution marketplace where we announced that Wintrust Financial will onboard 2 of its wealth management businesses for our institution services plan.  \n And at the same time, we continued our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management business of Prudential Financial. Collectively, these 2 deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025.  \n Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also announced the planned acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions, which supports approximately 2,400 advisers and 150 banks in credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion of [ client assets ]. This transaction will give Atria advisers access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service. We are on track to close the transaction in the back half of this year and complete the conversion in mid-2025.  \n And finally, we're seeing solid momentum with our liquidity and succession solution as demand continues to build with existing LPL advisers while also creating interest with advisers outside our ecosystem, including our first signed external deal in the quarter.  \n Now within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to deliver a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services and technology that help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As a part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. And within that body of work, we are focused on meeting the evolving investment needs of our advisers and their clients, including the increasing interest for nontraditional investment products. To help solve for that demand, we are reimagining the end-to-end experience of our alternatives platform, including enhancing our custodial and operational capabilities for alternative investments, making it simpler and easier to utilize, manage and transact these products.  \n And at the same time, expanding our alternative investment product offer, for over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of products available for advisers to utilize.  \n Another key area within our vertical integration efforts is the continued enhancement of the experience our advisers deliver to their clients. One of the primary ways we do that is providing increased flexibility for advisers to tailor their ideal client experience. For example, we designed Account View, our in-client digital platform, so an adviser can personalize access to features on a client-by-client basis.  \n In addition, we recently launched a series of enhancements to our in-client statement which provides increased flexibility in the channel of delivery and the cadence that clients receive the information, also adding a unique interactive digital experience to further enrich the traditional statement. Our continued work on our services portfolio is also a key area of our vertical integration strategy. And as a reminder, these services help solve for a broad spectrum of advisers and institutions' need, and in doing so, help position them to deliver great advice and be great operators of the businesses. In that spirit, we are developing a number of solutions that help advisers expand the breadth and depth of their advice, including the more effective utilization of financial planning, catering to the more complex needs of high net worth investors and delivering more personalized investment [ search ].  \n For example, as a part of our efforts to enrich our planning capabilities, last year, we introduced our tax planning service, which is seeing strong demand in the market. And more recently, we expanded our high net worth services to enhance our adviser support of their high net worth prospects and clients through complex case design, state planning and investment product analysis. And the early indications have been favorable.  \n Finally, we're in pilot with our latest innovation, our new outsourced Chief Investment Officer service, which provides advisers with personalized investment expertise powered by LPL [ research ]. And based on the initial feedback, this is unlocking additional growth and efficiency in our advisers' practices. Collectively, these services help expand our advisers' value proposition to their clients, enable them to win new prospects, and increase the differentiation of the feel of our platform. \n And as we move forward, we will continue to solve for our advisers' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect businesses for themselves, and ultimately maximize their success.  \n In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Yes. So Devin, it's Dan. Let me try to go in maybe a sequential order around those questions that is helpful. So first, maybe let me just tick Q1, I think, organic growth, which I heard inside your question. So during the quarter, we posted 5% organic growth. And given the seasonality we typically see in Q1, we would have expected that to be more like 7%. And while the underlying drivers of the business were strong, there were a couple of things in the quarter that drove the roughly 2% difference.  \n The first was some impact from the timing of onboarding recruiting, which equated to roughly 1% to Q1 organic growth. And that's just really a function of the recruiting, as we mentioned, I think, back in January's call, a lot of it happening in the second half of the quarter. And that gives you a little tailwind going into the second quarter.  \n And then the second thing that we mentioned last quarter as well was that there were 2 acquired practices that departed in January which accounted for a 1% impact to our attrition. So outside of those impacts, which we would categorize as a bit of noise, the underlying drivers that set us up well for the rest of the year remain intact and that's where you were getting at that record level of recruiting. The strongest pipelines that we've had ever historically and our continued low levels of adviser attrition that was consistent with the experience over the last couple of years. So we feel good coming out of the quarter and how we see that opportunity emerge over the remainder of the year. \n I think you mentioned a bit of the -- perhaps some -- how we think about new stores specifically or recruiting going forward, maybe it was second part of your question. And I think, look, we had a really nice quarter, $20 billion in recruited assets. You see significant growth year-on-year across all affiliation models. And at the same time, at expanded addressable market, our increasing win rates, it's driving that deep pipeline that I mentioned as we -- as deep a pipeline as we've seen and certainly is supportive of where we head going forward. And that gives us a really solid conviction that we're well positioned to continue to win a larger share of advisers in motion with respect to recruiting. And I think when you add them to the committed wins we have in the large institution marketplace, that sets up with a solid opportunity with respect to new store sales as we move forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on the quarter and then a little color around the recruiting [ firm ]. Yes. Let me start that and then, Matt, you add any color on economics you think would be helpful. So look, I think with respect to the recruiting environment, right, we always start with the opportunity set. Adviser movement over the last 12 months has hovered around 5%, which remains lower than the historical norms. That said, despite those low overall movement, our win rates continue to move higher. And certainly, that's an encouraging trend relative to how we think about the opportunity set. \n And then two, I think when we think about the environment, we look at the competitive landscape and the participants have remained largely the same. As do the priorities that advisers are looking for when they evaluate their options to potentially move. And as a reminder, the first priorities is around capabilities, technology and service. That's where we continue to further distinguish ourselves as we invest back into our model. \n Next is the ongoing economics, which haven't changed significantly over time. And I think in the independent space, especially create a compelling and interesting scenario for advisers. And then lastly, you get transition assistance rates, which we've seen pretty stable over the last year and feel good about how we're well positioned across our portfolio of different affiliation models in terms of how we support that adviser to make that transition. \n So given all of that, the strength of our overall value proposition continues to resonate, and we remain really confident that the ongoing appeal of our model positions us well to sustain our industry-leading win rates and market share. I don't know, you want to add anything to that, Matt? [indiscernible]. It was user error on my part. Sorry about that. So let me start over. And again, I think as we've discussed before, our opportunity set is really driven by trying to solve that big strategic question of how do we help potentially as many as 1/3 advisers retire and transition their businesses over the next 10 years. And while there are a variety of options that are available in the marketplace, we think ours is really differentiated and a compelling one in a very elegant way to help these advisers transition their practices to take care of them, to take care of their team, to take care of their clients and ultimately create a bridge to the next entrepreneurial leader or owner. \n And in that spirit, I think since we've rolled it out to our advisers, it's been -- which was late in 2022, it's been very, very appealing for those that are exposed to those possibilities. And as Matt said, we closed roughly 27 deals to date. And given the success with our existing advisers, now we've extended the question to the external marketplace and in the fourth quarter, began to explore how we could help those advisers that are on the LPL platform with the same type of solution to that big question of how do they transition their practices. And as we mentioned, we were fortunate enough to close our first deal in Q1, and we've got a pretty solid pipeline building there. \n So I think we see it as this multidimensional opportunity of supporting and helping our existing advisers which extend those assets on our platform for another generation of advisers and then, two, also, as a catalyst for growth to complement the other opportunities that we focus on and have to drive growth. And we think it's a compelling differentiated solution. A little hard to replicate. So we think it will resonate in the external market. I hope that helps. Yes. So I think -- listen, relative to onboarding these programs and making sure that we have the ability to support and scale them, I think it is something that we've been working on since the good fortune of onboarding some of the larger financial institutions, BMO and M&T in 2021. And so our guiding principle when we explore any growth initiative, whether it's organic win, like large institutions or even an acquisition like Atria is to ensure that we're going to continue to deliver an exceptional experience to our existing advisers and that then we provide a seamless transition for advisers that are joining our platform. And in that spirit, we've continued to evolve our transition approach because we've iterated, we've improved and gotten a lot better over the last few years. We established a disciplined operating rigor. We use seasoned run books and automation, all in the spirit of delivering a high-quality successful outcomes that are repeatable and sustainable. And with each iteration, as I mentioned, we continue to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of how we execute the onboarding process. \n Now the important part about that is that certainly then improves and enhances the quality that we deliver but also the pace at which we can deliver these. And I think as we continue to go forward with each iteration, we adopt new ideas, new concepts, new ways of which to do them in a simpler and faster way, and we'll continue to work on that and iterate that I think will help us know and deliver an industry-leading onboarding experience but do it in the simplest and fastest way possible in the market place. So that's sort of the context of how we think about increasing the capacity to support that ongoing opportunity. \n I think -- and then your second question, remind me what it was. Yes. So again, I think we've seen that marketplace as sort of an emerging opportunity where we took a novel concept back in 2020 as we began to offer it to the marketplace and establish a significant advantage from just having market share developing and growing IP around how to support and serve those clients. And then ultimately, continuing to evolve our capability set to make sure that we can help them in terms of their risk profile or cluster around this business line or service, increase or enhance financial results or manage the performance of their programs to create operational efficiency and scalability into their programs and then ultimately, to support them with growth. If we can do that within this value proposition and then have the advantage of the history and the experience of operating and working with these clients, the better practice at onboarding through the change management. A very complex effort. But that gives us a distinctive disadvantage in the marketplace that we think really resonates when we go out and share that with any prospective new clients. \n So I think we feel great about our positioning in the marketplace, the insights and perspective that we've been bringing forward that have enriched our value proposition that again, it's hard to do if you hadn't had the experience from doing so. That's how we think about that leadership. We think it's pretty durable and an interesting ongoing growth opportunity. Yes. So with respect to the institution pipeline, we have continued opportunity to get swings in the batter's box in the large bank space. Obviously, we've had established a series of a number of years of success in bringing those clients on and a success that those institutions are having once on the platform from a financial performance standpoint, from new capabilities and solutions and features, I think certainly reinforces the value that the model can provide them and thus helps us in those ongoing dialogues with other opportunities within the bank space. That's about a $1 trillion opportunity or a marketplace. And so there's a number of opportunities that remain out there, and we're encouraged by the dialogue we're having in that part of the marketplace. \n And then I think also with the win with Pru, right, we expanded that market to include kind of wealth management solutions that are owned or operated by audit manufacturers and specifically insurance companies. And I think that's -- certainly that win created the opportunity to have a number of dialogues that companies that are similar in nature to a Prudential and certainly exploring the possibility of outsourcing, where an outsourcing solution wasn't always available in that part of the marketplace. And so a longer sales cycle and sort of longer iterative consultative approach to that. We are encouraged by the emerging dialogue and discussions we're having in that part of the markets. \n I think that's your first question. Your second one, ask again, please? Yes. Thank you. Sorry. So I think I answered the first one. So on the second half, with respect to some of the capabilities that we're thinking about relative to Pru, part of the opportunity in exploring that and solving for that was I think creating what I think are 2 interesting applications that are somewhat novel in the marketplace today. The first one is the expansion of our platform that will enable the audit manufacturer and the LPL suite of products to exist in a single experience. \n And if you think about that relative to insurance, as an example, that can be a really important element and differentiator where you get a really seamless integrated solution set across your entire product offering in. Again, that's kind of a novel concept and a hypothesis of a lot of folks thinking, wow, that would be a really interesting thing to solve for and I think inside this opportunity, we're solving for that. So we're really encouraged about that. And again, once you do that, that can be valuable to any a number of other different larger institutions that might value that. \n Second one would be an integrated operating platform that embeds workflows and connectivity, not only through our systems, but to the parent and third-party systems. And so it's kind of a cool operational efficiency, again, across the landscape of business they do, that makes it easy for them to collaborate, operate and work with us in a very integrated way. So those are just 2 [ different sets. ] I think we think are really, again, interesting and differentiating them but also applicable to other potential prospects. I hope that helps. Thanks. Yes. So as we said, it's been a hot topic over the last week since the release. But look, the headline is that I think the final rule reflects some hopeful changes from the original proposal and generally better aligns with the SEC's Reg BI, which we believe is a good thing for investors. And as you probably have seen, the rules is scheduled to become effective in September, although there is a 1-year transition period for firms that acknowledge [ fiduciary established ] and comply with specified conduct standards. So that's probably a long-winded way to say. There's probably a year time line in and around getting any changes that need to be required or made in your compliance programs in place such that you can build those new responsibilities. \n That said, our team is working to finalize the design and implementation of our compliance program. And again, we feel good about that preparation and the ability to execute around the effective framework -- effective dates and framework that we've seen thus far. We're able to leverage some of the work we did in 2016, which ultimately wasn't implemented, in addition to some work that we've already done connected to Reg BI. So at the same time, there are a few areas like around rollovers where we'll have to deploy new approaches and solutions, again, we can come -- they're solvable for us. \n All that said, it's safe to assume that there will be litigation challenging the rule as there was a case with successful litigation we saw back in response to the 2016. All of that could potentially impact both the compliance approach that any of us take in the time line. So we draw out on that, but we do think it was a better landing spot than originally. Yes. So Bill, you were speaking to the opportunity set. Again, it goes back to, in many cases, what we're solving for is the succession for these advisers. And I think given the size of that need has driven the proliferation of maybe innovation in that area to try to solve for it. And so if it's -- there's 300,000 advisers in the marketplace and 1/3 of them are going to retire over the next 10 years, that would be a total opportunity set. \n I think, for now, a lot of these transactions have been targeted for larger practices because to do these transactions, it's just -- it could be a complex administrative process to work through it. And so it's probably not fair to say then it's all 100,000 that are retiring in the next 10 years as the opportunity set. \n That said, the constraints around the administrative complexity to do these deals will certainly get easier as everyone in the marketplace learns, iterates, evolves on how to do that. And that constraint then will allow that capacity to go up. And as firms learn how to onboard these folks and do it in a highly successful way, then again, I think that constraint will go up and you'll see increased number and sizes of these over time. And so that's how we think at least about how we think about the opportunity set and make sure that we have a compelling value proposition to support these folks once they transition over. And once we serve them in the context and the capacity that they are being served in as an employee of LPL and thus as part of a transition of the succession plan over the 5-year period of time, we're delivering value and capabilities that we've built in a lot of our affiliation models that enable us to do that really in an efficient and effective way. \n And so we can scale that where we couldn't have if we didn't have the 3 or 4 years of experience in building those capabilities. And so I think it's just that front-end administrative operational work for doing these deals, and those again, we can get more efficient at them, we'll scale that up. We do think, again, it's compelling opportunity that is some relevant for folks that are in traditional employee-based models. It's relevant for anyone that has their own independent business, just trying to explore how to transition the business and create a succession outcome that's good for them. So it is a relevant business across the -- sorry, a relevant opportunity across the industry, and again, I think we'll continue to innovate, evolve and get better and better at it. I suspect we'll have competition out in the marketplace because it's a big problem to solve. But we think we've got a good head start and good infrastructure of which to leverage and scale. Yes. I just want to thank everyone for making the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."
