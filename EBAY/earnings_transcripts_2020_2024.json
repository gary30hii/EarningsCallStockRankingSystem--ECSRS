[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Joe Billante, VP of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJoe Billante: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us and welcome to eBay\u2019s earnings release conference call for the fourth quarter of 2020. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cring, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We are providing a slide presentation to accompany Andy\u2019s commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie and Andy\u2019s remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise. In this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of February 3, 2021, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with some key highlights from last quarter of last year, and walk you through an update on the progress of eBay\u2019s tech-led re-imagination. I will then turn the call over to Andy to discuss the details of our recent performance and near-term outlook. Overall, 2020 was a great year for sellers and buyers on eBay. We are pleased that we closed out the year with strong results. For Q4, gross merchandise volume in marketplaces grew 18%, well ahead of our expectations. The holiday season contributed to the strong performance as we saw record volume with high velocity in hard-to-find and sold-out items. Refurbished gifts also emerged as a top trend, and we saw many products from top brands in our certified refurbished experience sell out completely. Our buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the U.S., 1 in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. In Germany, that number was 1 in 7. And in the UK, it was 1 in 4. In addition to this holiday surge, we experienced unprecedented traffic levels for most of 2020, and yet our platform had the highest availability in the last 6 years. To put this in context, more than 100 days in 2020 exceeded peak 2019 traffic levels. eBay has been able to seamlessly handle these peaks, while keeping our marketplace open for all during a global pandemic. For the full quarter, revenue grew 10 points faster than volume, up 28% driven primarily by payments and advertising. And we delivered $0.86 in non-GAAP earnings per share, which was above our expectations and included reinvestments for the long-term. Our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace in the quarter. Active buyers grew 7% to $185 million globally, and our active seller base increased by 5% as more small business and consumer sellers listed and sold on the platform. These results capped off a tremendous year for eBay. In 2020, we added an incremental $14 billion of GMV, that\u2019s more growth in the past 7 years combined. Organic revenue grew 21% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 49%, and we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In July, I laid out a long-term vision for the company, and we have rearchitected our roadmap to achieve our tech-led reimagination over the next few years. We also made progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which drove tremendous financial results while providing customers with a significantly improved experience. We continue to make significant advancements with our managed payments transition, ending the year with over 1 million sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 38% of on-platform volume. In the U.S., we exited the year with over 50% of the migration complete. In addition to the 5 markets where we already launched, transitions have been announced or underway in France, Italy, Spain and Greater China. We have also started to transition consumer sellers in the U.S., UK, Canada and Germany. Seller satisfaction has improved compared to Q3 and NPS scores from sellers in managed payments remain more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Over the course of 2021, we plan to roll out payments to remaining markets, launch cross-border trade and release product capabilities for all use cases. This roadmap opens up managed payments to all sellers globally and places us firmly on our path toward 100% migration. As the vast majority of the transition will be complete by the end of this year, we are well positioned to deliver at least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating income annually in 2022. In Q4, advertising growth outpaced volume once again as sellers lean further into promoted listings to grow their business. For the quarter, promoted listings delivered over $215 million of revenue, up 57% despite having lapped a major product launch that drove strong acceleration a year ago. For the full year, promoted listings grew 86%. This product continues to grow, in part because sellers who have adopted promoted listings are seeing, on average, a double-digit sales increase. Our total advertising revenue reached a new milestone in 2020, passing $1 billion for the year. We see tremendous growth potential remaining as this represents approximately 1% of GMV, well below industry benchmarks. We expect advertising revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future. Now I\u2019d like to share an update on the transfer of Classifieds to Adevinta. We remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. We believe the deal is on track to close as we have received the vast majority of regulatory approvals. We expect closure by the end of the first quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory approvals which we are working to obtain. We also recently announced that we are exploring options for our Korean business. Our 2 local platforms, Gmarket and IAC, have built leading e-commerce positions by tailoring to customer needs with innovative experiences. With a paid loyalty program of over 2.5 million members, and a growing first-party inventory program, these businesses primarily focus on new and seasoned products from B2C sellers with limited cross-border trade. As we mentioned in our press release, we will not be communicating any further information about the strategic review process until there is material information to disclose. I will now provide an update on the progress we have made towards our long-term vision for eBay. The three strategic priorities to support this vision remain the same: first, to defend our core by building compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts; second, to become the partner of choice for sellers; and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. In the past few months, we launched several new product experiences aligned with this vision. While we still have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the initial reaction from buyers and sellers and the acceleration in GMV in several categories. During the fall in the U.S., we launched authentication for luxury watches, and quickly rolled out a similar experience to sneakers a few weeks later. We have put a greater focus on protecting buyers and sellers by preventing counterfeits and eliminating fraudulent returns. These experiences are driving significantly higher-than-average customer satisfaction, and we see opportunities to expand this capability to other verticals and markets. This new product experience is driving material growth in these categories for U.S. business. For luxury watches over $2,000, we saw a double-digit increase in GMV growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by higher sell-through rates and higher average prices. For sneakers over $100, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in Q4. While some volume growth is due to the effects of the pandemic, significant growth drivers included the authentication rollout, pricing reductions and marketing changes. Sneaker buyer behavior is a great example of the power of the eBay platform. In 2020, the average customer who purchased a pair of sneakers over $100 spent a total of $2,500 on eBay. Approximately 80% of that spend was in categories outside of sneakers. We will continue to drive more cross-category shopping to grow GMV per buyer over time. To expand the buyer base, we are investing in new channels, including social marketing to reach more Gen Z and millennial customers. We launched a TikTok campaign called Lace \u2018Em Up, generating 4.7 billion views. And we also have been partnering with celebrities, famous athletes and influencers on exclusive promotions. Another area of non-new and season inventory we\u2019re focused on is outlet fashion. In the UK, we launched an optimized brand outlet experience with 150 fashion brands offering products at deep discounts. This contributed to strong double-digit GMV growth in fashion ahead of UK market rates. We also saw active listings double and active buyers in the category grew 30% in Q4. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision becoming the platform of choice for sellers. In addition to enhancements in payments and advertising, we continue to provide small businesses with more tools and capabilities to help them grow. In Q4, we added more automation and scale to sell our initiated offers. This uniquely eBay feature allows sellers to escape the limits of a buyback by enabling them to offer custom deals to individual buyers. For the year, seller-initiated offers drove over $1.2 billion of GMV. Another win for sellers on eBay in Q4 was in SEO. The work we have done in the past to optimize our platform for search engine ranking and visibility is paying off. SEO traffic is growing faster than paid channels and delivering more new buyers to small business sellers on eBay. Last, we continued to increase seller visibility in our native app by driving traffic to their eBay stores. 95% of our store subscribers have migrated to the newest experience, and they are seeing a 20% average increase in visits to their storefront. The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. A major focus for us has been the native app experience. In 2020, almost half of our global GMV was transacted in the app, and it continues to grow faster than the overall business as buyer and seller preferences evolved. We have maintained high ratings in both iOS and Android, and our app was downloaded more than 50 million times in 2020. To drive engagement from buyers on mobile, we have simplified item pages, made it easier to like or share an item and provided more exposure by creating direct access to seller stores. Additionally, we improved conversion by enhancing search relevance and streamlining sort and filter options, allowing app users to find what they are looking for faster. While we are focused on delivering our vision, we remain committed to keeping our purpose at the forefront by leveraging the power of our platform to support our communities. One way we did this last year was by helping to quickly and efficiently distribute PPE to frontline workers in the UK eBay partnered with the UK\u2019s National Health Service, the Department for Health and Social Care and logistic partners on this effort. I am proud to report that in December, the NHS PPE portal powered by eBay reached a significant milestone. Together, we delivered more than 1 billion PPE items to more than 45,000 social care providers in the UK. Another way the eBay platform provides opportunity is by enabling a thriving customer community that loves to give back. During the year that has been challenging for so many, the eBay for Charity community continues to be an inspiration. 2020 was a record-breaking year with nearly $123 million raised globally in charitable donations. The generosity showed by our buyers and sellers is amazing. The spirit of a global community centered around connection and economic opportunity for all is clearly alive and well. Over the course of 2020, eBay invested more than $100 million to support the growing needs of small businesses around the world through programs like Up & Running. These programs provided the access, training and resources needed to start selling online and connect new sellers to eBay\u2019s global community of buyers. And just last quarter, we announced further assistance through Up & Running grant program. In the coming weeks, we will reward a number of eBay U.S. small business sellers a grant package worth $10,000 each. As I have mentioned in the past, at eBay, we focus our sustainability initiatives on the most impactful goals that will help strengthen our business and provide the most value to all our stakeholders. And our commitment to climate action and transparency is being recognized externally. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America indices and recognized in the Carbon Disclosure Project A List for the first time. In the past year alone, we have avoided an additional 720,000 metric tons of carbon emissions through people selling their pre-owned electronics and apparel on eBay. In summary, we are making progress on our vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, and we have a clear roadmap for 2021 and beyond. Our payments transition is on track and will largely be completed this year. Our advertising business will continue to outpace volume through promoted listings and other products. As we defend the quarter, we plan to expand our new vertical experiences to more markets and innovate in more categories. To-date, we have only touched a single-digit percentage of our global GMV, but in the coming years, that will expand to a majority of volume. To build a platform of choice for sellers, we will continue to expand the stores experience and give sellers more tools to increase velocity. We will also leverage technology to dramatically simplify the end-to-end selling process for consumer and business sellers. To create more lifelong buyer relationships, we will connect with them through new channels, deepen their engagement with the eBay app and deliver trusted experiences when they shop with us. Last but not least, we will continue to invest in product and technology, and evolve how we spend marketing in order to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. I know we can accomplish all of this due to the fantastic team I have the privilege of leading. Our employees live our purpose in 2020, and I look forward to what we can do together for our customers in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?\nAndy Cring: Thanks, Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on Slide 5, we exited the year with 185 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, a 2 point acceleration versus the third quarter. Since the end of Q1, we\u2019ve added 11 million buyers to the ecosystem and are seeing retention rates in line with historical cohorts. We continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across the buyer base. Moving to Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $26.6 billion of marketplace GMV, up 18% year-on-year. While volume decelerated 3 points versus the third quarter, we did see modest acceleration compared to September growth rates, driven by a decrease in consumer mobility and benefits from ongoing improvements in the product experience across horizontal work streams and the progress we\u2019re making in key verticals. In the U.S., we generated $9.6 billion of GMV in Q4, up 25% year-on-year, decelerating 8 points from Q3. International GMV was up 15% year-on-year, a 1 point acceleration versus the third quarter, inclusive of growth in our off-platform Korean business at 5%, accelerating 1 point from Q3. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $100 billion of GMV, up 17% year-on-year, an acceleration of 19 points versus the prior year. Turning to revenue on Slide 7, our Q4 net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% organically, accelerating 2 points. We delivered $2.6 billion of transaction revenue, up 31%, accelerating 3 points from Q3, driven by our payments migration and strength in advertising. In managed payments, strong execution continued as we rapidly expanded seller migration to the new payments platform, reaching over 38% of global on-platform volume in the quarter. In addition to the higher customer satisfaction metrics that Jamie mentioned, managed payments contributed 10 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019. Transaction take rate was 9.8% for the quarter, accelerating 40 basis points, driven by managed payments and promoted listings partially offset by FX. This is the second straight quarter with a 40 basis point increase, and we expect take rate to continue to grow as managed payments and promoted listings continue to scale. We delivered $270 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 3%, accelerating 4 points from Q3, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of brands4friends, partially offset by first-party growth in Korea, which decelerated approximately 40 points to 60% year-on-year growth. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $10.3 billion in revenue, up 20%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes as well as strong execution in our initiatives. In advertising, we cleared $1 billion, ahead of expectations and powered by the 86% growth in promoted listings. And managed payments delivered 8 points of incremental revenue growth in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers, in Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 28.1%. This is up approximately 20 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume leverage and growth in advertising, partially offset by reinvestments and FX. Cost of revenue was up over 1 point year-on-year, driven by managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea, partially offset by volume leverage. Sales and marketing expense was down approximately 50 basis points versus the prior year as volume leverage and spend efficiency were partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. Product development costs were flat as volume leverage was offset by investments in the product experience, including managed payments. G&A was down approximately 70 basis points, primarily from volume leverage and cost control, partially offset by charitable donations to support the eBay Foundation. Transaction losses were down 10 basis points as bad debt rates have performed better than expected. For the year, operating margin was 31.3%, up 3 points; 2 points from volume upside, net of reinvestment; and 1 point from continued cost efficiency related to our operational review. Turning to EPS on Slide 9, in Q4, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, a reduction in share count driven by our repurchases and growth in advertising and payments, partially offset by a higher tax rate and investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. For the year, we delivered 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS, primarily driven by volume, reduction in share count from our repurchase program, growth in advertising and payments in addition to continued cost efficiency, partially offset by FX, a higher tax rate and lower interest income. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12, up 94% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors of non-GAAP performance, plus the change in the value of investments, including the fair value of the Adyen warrant, partially offset by a higher tax rate. For the year, we delivered 100% growth in GAAP EPS, primarily driven by the fair value of the Adyen warrant, non-GAAP performance, our share repurchase program, partially offset by a higher tax rate. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to Slide 10, in Q4, we generated $715 million of free cash flow, up 27%, driven by higher earnings. We had a very strong year of cash generation finishing 2020 with $2.7 billion of free cash flow, a 29% increase year-on-year, driven by top line growth, improved working capital and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Moving to Slide 11, for the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $4.1 billion and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q4, we repurchased nearly 8.5 million shares at an average price of $49.46 per share, amounting to $419 million. For the year, we repurchased nearly 124 million shares at an average price of $41.31, amounting to $5.1 billion in total. We ended the year with $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Moving to Slide 12, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our investments, starting with the pending Classifieds transaction. As Jamie said, we remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. When we announced the transfer on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and Adevinta shares. The share price has appreciated by over 10%, which increased the value of the Classifieds business to nearly $10.7 billion based on recent trading levels. We expect that the cash portion of the transfer will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any future sale of our stake would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate. Turning to Adyen, the warrant we acquired in Q2 of 2018 is valued at $1.1 billion at the end of Q4, an increase of $770 million year-on-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the plan of at least $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-K. For both of these investments, we remain excited about the optionality they provide, including the significant value each can generate for shareholders. Moving to guidance on Slide 13, given the limited visibility to potential outcomes in the longer term, we are providing guidance for the first quarter and we will reassess providing longer-term guidance at a later date. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.94 billion and $2.99 billion, growing between 35% to 37% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace\u2019s volume growth in the low 20s, driven by strength in e-commerce and continued improvements in our user experience. In addition, we expect further take rate expansion driven by ongoing strong execution in managed payments and advertising. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 to $1.08 per share, representing 49% to 57% growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS growth will be driven primarily by volume, lower share count, managed payments and advertising, partially offset by continued investments in product and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.81 to $0.86 per share in Q1. In February, our Board approved a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.18 per share. The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 1 with the payment date of March 19. Our Board has also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, with no expiration, raising the total authorization to approximately $6 billion. While we aren\u2019t guiding for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context for our path forward. On volume, while we are in early days, we feel great about the progress we are making on the strategy we\u2019ve laid out, and believe these efforts will continue to deliver growth as we scale. In the near term, it is important to note that we will begin to lap significantly tougher comps toward the end of Q1. And looking at Q2 specifically, we will be facing into our peak level of growth in 2020, that was driven by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments around the world and supply chain disruptions that our globally distributed sellers were well positioned to overcome. We expect revenue will continue to outpace GMV as seller migration into managed payments nears completion. And we expect ads to continue to grow faster than volume on our way to the next $1 billion. On margin, we expect to continue to drive operational efficiency, while investing into higher rates of long-term revenue growth. We maintain our commitment of delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We expect to deliver strong free cash flow and we will continue to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends while being opportunistic with strategic M&A to accelerate our core strategy. Throughout 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet by leveraging favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt within our existing targets and tenants. We will continue to optimize our capital structure and recently announced our intention to call our retail bond that we plan to replace with debt at favorable rates in 2021. In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year. We added $14 billion of GMV and 11 million active buyers to our ecosystem. We executed in payments and advertising, which delivered a combined 7 points of incremental revenue growth compared to GMV for the year, 13 points in the fourth quarter. We processed over 38% of on-platform GMV through managed payments in the fourth quarter while improving experiences for buyers and sellers. We cleared $1 billion in advertising in the year, highlighted by 86% growth within promoted listings. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 49%, and delivered strong free cash flow of $2.7 billion. We executed a comprehensive portfolio review, including the divestiture of StubHub for $4 billion, the pending transfer of eCG assets at a favorable valuation and announced the decision to explore options for Korea in January. We returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, repurchasing $5.1 billion of our own shares, taking advantage of a market price that we do not believe reflects the value of our company. And in these imaginably tough times, we were there to help our employees, sellers, buyers and communities while delivering strong results for our shareholders. We exit 2020 having improved the underlying health of the business by delivering on the strategy we implemented this year. And we entered 2021 focused and excited to deliver on the next phase of the strategy as we build more compelling next-gen experiences, become the partner of choice for sellers and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. And now, we would be happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. Appreciate all the color on some of the vertical moves you are making, especially with respect to watches and sneakers. Can you talk a little bit just strategically about how much you already have in place to capitalize on looking \u2013 going vertical by vertical within the marketplace or how much your sort of investments you have to make to unlock the opportunity over the longer term? And then understand on what you face in the middle part of the year with respect to comping against the growth from a year ago. Can you just talk philosophically about how much you think your exit velocity is going to matter against running against that comp versus how much you might want to make investments to sustain momentum in either buyer growth or buyer behavior to sort of outrun the comp through some of the investments you might be able to make against the business or just letting sort of the market play out from a comp perspective? Thanks so much.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Thanks, Eric. Let me take the first one on verticals and then Andy can take the second. So, we invested in those verticals really based on the strategy that we laid out in July of focusing on non-new and season and opportunities where we had strength to win. And if you look at those categories being watches, sneakers, which we rolled out surely after watches and then Certified Refurbished, we saw really great growth rates. I mentioned the triple-digit growth rate that we saw in sneakers. You got to remember, this was a business that had been in decline. And so to see it as strong as this shows us the power of really focusing on those verticals and the end-to-end experience for our customers. And so while those categories represent a single-digit percentage of our GMV, the plan is to continue to roll out new category experiences from an end-to-end perspective over the course of the coming years, eventually meeting the majority of our GMV. I will add that we included another area for us in the UK, where we piloted a fashion brand outlet with 150 fashion brand sellers performed really well, double-digit growth ahead of the market and ahead of what we expected. And so that kind of gives us the confidence that the strategy is working and the confidence to continue to rollout more categories over the coming quarters and years.\nAndy Cring: Yes, Eric. And then on the second part of your question on comps and investments, clearly, there is a lot of noise now with what\u2019s going on with the pandemic, but that hasn\u2019t stopped or really changed the approach we have taken towards building towards longer term growth. It\u2019s given us a little bit of a tailwind to lean in a bit on investment. But the beauty of this model is as I said in my prepared remarks, we are committed to the 30% margin and we believe that we have got a very strong plan to get there. And we feel like we have done or made great progress on the initiatives this year, exiting the year stronger, certainly stronger than we entered and stronger than we had anticipated when we entered the year as we look at the controllable aspects of growth if you peel apart what we can see from COVID-related items.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, guys. Two quick ones for me. I guess first you\u2019ve made some really strong strides in getting some new customers, getting them back to the platform. I guess what are you doing to kind of ensure that they aren\u2019t just one and done. If it\u2019s not they were buying something COVID related or buying a video game system for their kids this holiday. And as a follow-up nice to see the strength in sneakers and watches, I know you guys have a third-party authentication services, I believe. Kind of what\u2019s the scalability of those solutions as you continue to grow those businesses? Thank you. \nJamie Iannone: Yes. So starting on the buyer ones, we acquired 11 million buyers over the course of the year. And what we\u2019re seeing is that the behavior, when we look at things like frequency and retention, is not different and is as strong as we\u2019ve seen in past cohorts, which means they didn\u2019t just come to us for eBay to buy a specific PPE and then we won\u2019t see them again. We\u2019re doing a good job of turning a percentage of them into enthusiasts. And what we\u2019re really focused on is how do we turn them into cross-category shoppers. So as I mentioned in the remarks, a sneaker buyer who comes into eBay is going to be worth $2,500, or they end up buying $2,500 worth of GMV. But only 20% of that is in sneakers, and 80% of that will be in other categories across the site. And that\u2019s a huge advantage for us because of the cross-category nature that we have of the platform. And it\u2019s also a specific focus and something that we lean into a lot is driving it. And a lot of that growth is coming from C2C, and is bringing Gen Z and millennials to the platform, which is also critical and part of our strategy. In terms of the authentication, we\u2019ve ramped up the amount of authenticating we\u2019re doing to now every sneaker over $100 going through the authentication platforms. And we\u2019re seeing great response and great operations there. So consumers are getting their sneakers really quickly, and the authentication process is working. And look, while it\u2019s a very, very small percentage of things that we find where there are issues that guarantee for customers is a huge differentiator and is a big part of what\u2019s leading to the triple-digit growth. So we\u2019re leaning in a lot in terms of marketing and acquiring those customers in that category, and we\u2019re excited for what we\u2019re seeing.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hi, guys. Just two questions. First is international, it looks like you had some nice acceleration there. You mentioned Korea, but I would guess that UK and Germany are also accelerating. And based on the guidance, it\u2019s probably happening again in 1Q. So I guess, can you just walk through how much of that\u2019s like these company-specific initiatives versus just the overall kind of macro situations like mobility and lockdowns in 4Q and 1Q? And then second question is you mentioned that SEO is growing faster than paid, I think, was the comment. And that was a problem area from like 6, 7 years ago. So just, I guess, what are you doing that\u2019s new to unlock that SEO and how big could that channel be for you guys on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nAndy Cring: Got it. Hey, Ross, I\u2019ll take the first one. On Q4 dynamics and then the international versus U.S. split, it looks like there\u2019s a bit of a difference between U.S. and international growth rates, with the U.S. down 8 and international accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That\u2019s really less an impact of what we saw in the fourth quarter and more an impact of kind of the unwind of the second quarter spike and how third quarter rates played through. So keep in mind, in the U.S. in the third quarter, the growth rate \u2013 the deceleration from Q2 was a little less. So when we look at third quarter \u2013 or fourth quarter and how it plays through into the first, it\u2019s really for us more what we saw \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen since September with some acceleration really in all \u2013 basically all countries around the world. And that\u2019s played through to the first quarter, and it\u2019s implied in the acceleration you see in our Q1 guidance. So clearly, mobility plays a large role in sustaining a level of growth and driving a bit of acceleration. But again, the initiatives we\u2019re working on and the progress we\u2019ve made with regards to product and marketing and managed payments and search contribute as well to the acceleration on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But clearly, the majority of that\u2019s going to be mobility driven, but underlying performance is better.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. And I\u2019d say on the SEO, look, there\u2019s a number of things that we\u2019ve been doing in terms of how we structure our listings and work with our content and designers that actually specifically drives it. There was some Google algorithmic change which we benefited from. And we\u2019ve been doing some upper funnel, specifically in targeted verticals, which we think helps some of our lower-funnel activity. I think the important thing to remember is, in general, 80% of our traffic on the site is organic and people coming to us directly, and that\u2019s really one of the strengths and assets of eBay. But certainly, the SEO is helping us with our initiatives to drive cross-category purchase and drive consideration.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Alright. Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. I\u2019m going to follow up again on cross-marketing, just to understand how new this initiative is, if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been working on throughout 2020 and if you have any metrics on maybe the number of cross-category purchases. And then secondly, I know there is some more focus on the competitive landscape. Perhaps you guys could comment on how you are perceiving the landscape with some call them up and coming marketplaces that cross some of your key categories? Alright, thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, on the cross-marketing, I think it\u2019s been important for eBay. Since I was here the first time, it continues to be a really important thing when you look at driving the CLTV of our buyers. If I go back to the sneaker example, I talked about the 80% outside the category, and that represents them purchasing in 10 categories out of that core category. I would even broaden that question to say, we\u2019re really studying a lot that first kind of 90-day experience for a customer and looking at all the things that drive the retention of them. And so getting them to download the mobile app, getting them to shop across category, getting them to watch or save items and really driving more of our marketing technology to align to driving the retention of the buyers. And that\u2019s why we are excited to see that. A big reason why we also focused on C2C selling is because if we acquire that buyer to come in as a buyer and then we get them to just do any kind of casual selling, they become 2x to 2.5x more valuable to us as a buyer. So really that whole kind of introductory life cycle and being really algorithmic, and using our best data science and AI, really working on our marketing technology to be able to leverage that more is a key focus for us. And look, on the competitive landscape, we feel great about our positioning. We significantly improved the NPS of our experiences, especially in those focused verticals that we talked about. And we\u2019re seeing really good feedback from buyers and sellers. And that\u2019s always the leading indicator is that CSAT and NPS performance and what\u2019s happening there. And so that, combined with the payment CSAT stuff we\u2019re seeing where sellers that are moving to our payments 2.0, our managed payments platform, have a 10 point higher NPS, is making us feel really good about where our competitive positioning is. And last thing I\u2019d say is just thinking about the scale, right? So we talked about $14 billion GMV that we grew year-on-year last year. That\u2019s more than the last 7 years combined. That\u2019s more than most vertical competitors would do in a year, we grew more than that amount. So being able to leverage those 185 million buyers, and have their purchasing cross-category is a huge and unique asset for eBay.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So I think, Jamie, previous management teams have talked about looking at managing the amount of page real estate dedicated to promoted listings for system or legacy forms of advertising. So are you yet in a place where you\u2019ve had to make those types of trade-off decisions in terms of one versus the other? And secondly, you recently announced the rollout of managed payments to both merchants and buyers in China. So I think part of the benefit of working with Adyen has been that you can accept different forms of online payment, which you probably couldn\u2019t do before. And this theoretically should help you take down some of the friction against cross-border trades. So does this help you think about potentially expanding your customer acquisition funnel as well? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first, on the advertising business, feel great about hitting the $1 billion milestone. As we look at it, a lot of that growth is being driven by the growth of promoted listings. And as we analyze it, we\u2019re seeing better seller penetration of people coming on the platform, better technology and tools in terms of our ability to do relevance, and we\u2019re not seeing it degrade the buyer experience, which is what gives us comfort that when we look at it in total being 1% of our total GMV that we have the opportunity to continue to have advertising growth faster than our GMV on the platform, and really based on that strength of promoted listings. On your question on managed payments, absolutely, it\u2019s a huge part of the win is really streamlining the payment process and providing more payment options. Cross-border trade for us has always been a great business, a really unique business to eBay and specifically in the Greater China corridor and helps us bring on new buyers to the platform and a different type of inventory. So between what we\u2019re doing in terms of speed pack and some of the forward deployed inventory, plus now as we expand payments to Greater China, we think that will help a number of the quarters in terms of our cross-border trade business.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nThomas Forte: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So you sort of touched on this in the prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could give a little more of an answer on it. So you\u2019ve made a number of changes to your operating assets over the last 18 months, wanted to get additional details on your thoughts on your long-term capital allocation strategy, including M&A, buybacks and dividends? And on the M&A part, are you looking more for tuck-ins or would you be looking for something more of a growth-type asset, too? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, there is really nothing different about our thinking towards capital allocation. Our model gives us the flexibility to both invest back in our business organically and opportunistically to look at M&A as well as return capital to shareholders. Our business generates a high amount of free cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. And I think we have a track record of both exercising discipline in our portfolio as well as maximizing value for shareholders. So we\u2019ll continue to look opportunistically at M&A and do so for tech and talent or areas that we believe are going to accelerate the strategy that we laid out in July. Andy, do you want to add anything to that?\nAndy Cring: Yes. I mean, I think the only thing I\u2019d add is, while we do \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty active playing field with what\u2019s coming with eCG and the like. I think if you look at historically what we\u2019ve done with StubHub and some of the things in the past, you can expect it will be consistent in what we\u2019ve done. Our tenants and targets are unchanged. And our number focus is do what we can to invest back in the business to grow organically, look at M&A, where it helps us to do that. We remain committed to shareholder return. And I just expect us to continue to do that.\nThomas Forte: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Great. Good afternoon. We\u2019ve done survey work here that reflects a rising interest in pre-owned goods among Gen Z and the millennial cohort. Just curious if you are seeing this trend reflected in your new buyer growth as well, whether you would kind of agree with that? And then maybe just a second question around advertising. There are clearly some larger Internet platforms saying iOS changes will make small business advertising more difficult and degrade ROI this year. And just curious if you think this represents an opportunity for eBay to step in and offer a solution among SMBs? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So, first on the Gen Z and millennials, absolutely, it\u2019s a huge area of why we are focused on pre-owned not only because of the attractiveness there, but also just the impact on the planet. If you look at the numbers that we talked about from saving 720,000 metric tons of carbon emission, we recently did a survey, it probably sounds like much of the survey that you\u2019ve done. And what we saw is that 72% of our sellers that come and start selling on the platform are doing so because they need to earn a little bit of extra money and some percentage of those are actually because they lost their job, and so they\u2019re looking for opportunities on just making money on the platform. The other thing that\u2019s important to remember is that we believe that people have about $4,000 of items in their house that they can sell, less than 20% of that is online. And so there\u2019s a huge kind of social element which we\u2019re leaning into as part of that, but definitely a focus on the Gen Z millennials. And you\u2019re seeing that in sneakers, you\u2019re seeing that in what we did with our brand fashion outlet in the U.K., and you\u2019ll see us continue to focus on attracting that customer to the platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJamie Iannone: And before you do, I forgot that I didn\u2019t answer your advertising question. So let me just cover that one real quickly. So look, we believe that ads is beneficial for us because we essentially have a closed platform. We\u2019re able to drive the majority of that growth through promoted listings, where we actually can see the actual relevance, the implications, the click-throughs, all of the data that makes that impactful. So yes, that gives us, I think, a lot of bullishness in terms of the future opportunity for us in advertising, especially since we\u2019re only penetrated at 1% of GMV. And we think there is opportunities to continue to expand the number of sellers that use the platform as well as build new capabilities to make that platform even more attractive with some new tools, etcetera, which you\u2019ll see over the coming quarters and coming years.\nYoussef Squali: Can you hear me?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Go ahead. Sorry about that.\nYoussef Squali: Excellent. Hey, no, thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question. I just have a two-part question. One, if I look at Slide 6, the GMV breakdown, it looks like U.S. GMV was up 25% year-on-year, which is pretty impressive. If I look at it on a sequential basis, it was actually slightly down in a seasonally strong quarter. I was wondering if you can expand on that. And then related to that, as I look at your guidance for Q1 kind of what\u2019s baked into your guidance in terms of the mix between U.S. growth versus international? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: I think it was just about U.S. versus international for Q1 guidance.\nAndy Cring: Yes. I\u2019ll take that one first. Just on the \u2013 it\u2019s a little similar to the question earlier. Based on the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, kind of the movement in U.S. versus international was relatively similar. So as we look into Q1, what we\u2019ve seen thus far in the quarter and therefore implied in the guide is similar movements by country, so no real difference U.S. and international in terms of quarter-over-quarter dynamics. And then the first question, was it U.S. GMV only the deceleration?\nYoussef Squali: Yes, yes, yes. It\u2019s basically shown on Slide 6, yes.\nAndy Cring: That one again \u2013 yes, sorry, Youssef. That one, I think, again, if you \u2013 is less an issue \u2013 or less a component of Q4 activity as much as it is a hangover in Q3 of the spike in Q2. So the U.S. \u2013 I mean we had clearly a very large volume spike in the second quarter. Volume in the U.S. hung in longer in the third quarter, partially as a result of stimulus, partially as a result of some of the supply chain disruption. And then as that slowed down through the end of the third quarter, some of that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing play through in the quarter-over-quarter dynamics. But as I said, from September on, the activity by country has been relatively similar.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Andy, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nBob Drbul: Hey, guys. Just a couple of quick questions really. On the 7% increase in buyers, what would you put in the largest factors to the new buyers during this period versus what we\u2019ve seen over the last I don\u2019t know 9 to 12 months? And I guess the second question is just, are you seeing any change in Buy It Now versus the auction type buying with the consumer? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Sure, Bob. So look, the increase in buyer is, in part, doing a lot of the strategic work that we\u2019re doing and the focus verticals, you saw us do more marketing in the quarter, really talking about some of the new capabilities that we have out there. And we leaned in from a reinvestment standpoint to not only acquire those buyers, but to really to work on driving the retention of those buyers into our key platforms. So obviously, in a number of countries, it\u2019s also pandemic-related relative to mobility, but we\u2019ve also been leaning in to kind of take advantage of that and drive their cohort curves. And we\u2019ve been impressed that we\u2019ve been seeing from that perspective. In terms of the makeup of different format, Buy It Now remains the vast majority of what\u2019s on the platform. We do see strength in auctions in areas like collectibles, which is a category that\u2019s growing strong for us. But not only does Buy It Now remains strong, but we\u2019ve innovated over the years in things like best offer and in seller-initiated offers. And seller-initiated offers, as an example, is almost the inverse the best offer. Best offer is the buyer making an offer. Sellers can actually make specific individual offers to sellers who have interacted with one of their products, and we\u2019re doing $1.2 billion already in that. It\u2019s one of the unique elements of the eBay platform as auctions, best offers, seller-initiated offers are all ways for buyers and sellers to get to a negotiated price on the platform. But overall, Buy It Now still remains the vast majority of the business.\nBob Drbul: Great. Thank you very much.\nJoe Billante: Hey, operator, we got time for one more.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just the first one, Jim, I appreciate all the color around sort of the way you are studying the first 90 days of experience of the consumers and sort of the 80% of the traffic that comes organically. I\u2019d be curious to hear about, in the U.S., talk to us about what you\u2019ve seen as being the one or two key categories that have been the biggest enablers of the new people who have come to the platform. And how have you seen that change from last spring to now. Which categories are sort of driving the new people to the category? Then secondly, just as we think about the advertising business, just talk to us about qualitatively what types of investments you still see yourself needing to make internally to sort of ensure that the advertising business is set up to continue to scale and deliver value for the merchants? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, the buying behavior that we saw over the course of the year, it started in PPE equipment, then went to kind of stuff that people needed to work-from-home or stay-at-home, things like fitness equipment and laptops and that type of thing. But after that, it was really broad-based and continues to be broad-based in terms of where we\u2019re acquiring buyers. So, from everything from people spending time with their hobbies and parts and accessories or fixing up their cars to Certified Refurbished on what we are doing there, we are definitely seeing strength in buyer acquisition and the focused verticals that we have been talking about. So like apparel that we worked on in the quarter with the brand fashion outlet and in the areas that we announced in the U.S. and we will be expanding globally. So more important for us is not where we acquire them, but getting really smart and using a lot of AI about what\u2019s the best second category, how we\u2019re using all of our tools and capabilities across marketing and the apps and the websites to get them to interact in different parts of the business. And that\u2019s where I think about it just getting a little bit better every single day in how we\u2019re able to do that is going to be what continues to help drive those numbers. From an ads perspective, we\u2019re focused on the tools and capabilities to make it easier for sellers to use the product to give them templating and reporting of how it\u2019s doing and be able to have that closed-loop ROI on the spend that they have on the platform to make it more applicable to C2C sellers and make it really easy there, because obviously if you think about a sophisticated B2C seller, it\u2019s easier to interact with and much easier understands in advertising product. So, that\u2019s a big component of what we\u2019re doing. And then also just building new algorithms and relevance and machine learning into are we displaying the best thing to the buyers. So we continue to expand the program while not degrading the buying experience and, ideally, enhancing the buyer experience through what we\u2019re doing on our advertising products. So what you\u2019ll see is just continued quarter-after-quarter innovation in that product to help us keep the \u2013 grow the \u2013 and reach the potential of the product and have it continue to outpace GMV for the near and medium term.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.\nJoe Billante: Alright. I think we\u2019re all set. We can close the call. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andy Cring",
            "content": "Thanks, Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on Slide 5, we exited the year with 185 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, a 2 point acceleration versus the third quarter. Since the end of Q1, we've added 11 million buyers to the ecosystem and are seeing retention rates in line with historical cohorts. We continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across the buyer base. Moving to Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $26.6 billion of marketplace GMV, up 18% year-on-year. While volume decelerated 3 points versus the third quarter, we did see modest acceleration compared to September growth rates, driven by a decrease in consumer mobility and benefits from ongoing improvements in the product experience across horizontal work streams and the progress we're making in key verticals. In the U.S., we generated $9.6 billion of GMV in Q4, up 25% year-on-year, decelerating 8 points from Q3. International GMV was up 15% year-on-year, a 1 point acceleration versus the third quarter, inclusive of growth in our off-platform Korean business at 5%, accelerating 1 point from Q3. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $100 billion of GMV, up 17% year-on-year, an acceleration of 19 points versus the prior year. Turning to revenue on Slide 7, our Q4 net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% organically, accelerating 2 points. We delivered $2.6 billion of transaction revenue, up 31%, accelerating 3 points from Q3, driven by our payments migration and strength in advertising. In managed payments, strong execution continued as we rapidly expanded seller migration to the new payments platform, reaching over 38% of global on-platform volume in the quarter. In addition to the higher customer satisfaction metrics that Jamie mentioned, managed payments contributed 10 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019. Transaction take rate was 9.8% for the quarter, accelerating 40 basis points, driven by managed payments and promoted listings partially offset by FX. This is the second straight quarter with a 40 basis point increase, and we expect take rate to continue to grow as managed payments and promoted listings continue to scale. We delivered $270 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 3%, accelerating 4 points from Q3, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of brands4friends, partially offset by first-party growth in Korea, which decelerated approximately 40 points to 60% year-on-year growth. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $10.3 billion in revenue, up 20%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes as well as strong execution in our initiatives. In advertising, we cleared $1 billion, ahead of expectations and powered by the 86% growth in promoted listings. And managed payments delivered 8 points of incremental revenue growth in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers, in Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 28.1%. This is up approximately 20 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume leverage and growth in advertising, partially offset by reinvestments and FX. Cost of revenue was up over 1 point year-on-year, driven by managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea, partially offset by volume leverage. Sales and marketing expense was down approximately 50 basis points versus the prior year as volume leverage and spend efficiency were partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. Product development costs were flat as volume leverage was offset by investments in the product experience, including managed payments. G&A was down approximately 70 basis points, primarily from volume leverage and cost control, partially offset by charitable donations to support the eBay Foundation. Transaction losses were down 10 basis points as bad debt rates have performed better than expected. For the year, operating margin was 31.3%, up 3 points; 2 points from volume upside, net of reinvestment; and 1 point from continued cost efficiency related to our operational review. Turning to EPS on Slide 9, in Q4, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, a reduction in share count driven by our repurchases and growth in advertising and payments, partially offset by a higher tax rate and investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. For the year, we delivered 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS, primarily driven by volume, reduction in share count from our repurchase program, growth in advertising and payments in addition to continued cost efficiency, partially offset by FX, a higher tax rate and lower interest income. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12, up 94% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors of non-GAAP performance, plus the change in the value of investments, including the fair value of the Adyen warrant, partially offset by a higher tax rate. For the year, we delivered 100% growth in GAAP EPS, primarily driven by the fair value of the Adyen warrant, non-GAAP performance, our share repurchase program, partially offset by a higher tax rate. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to Slide 10, in Q4, we generated $715 million of free cash flow, up 27%, driven by higher earnings. We had a very strong year of cash generation finishing 2020 with $2.7 billion of free cash flow, a 29% increase year-on-year, driven by top line growth, improved working capital and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Moving to Slide 11, for the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $4.1 billion and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q4, we repurchased nearly 8.5 million shares at an average price of $49.46 per share, amounting to $419 million. For the year, we repurchased nearly 124 million shares at an average price of $41.31, amounting to $5.1 billion in total. We ended the year with $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Moving to Slide 12, I'd like to provide an update on our investments, starting with the pending Classifieds transaction. As Jamie said, we remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. When we announced the transfer on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and Adevinta shares. The share price has appreciated by over 10%, which increased the value of the Classifieds business to nearly $10.7 billion based on recent trading levels. We expect that the cash portion of the transfer will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any future sale of our stake would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate. Turning to Adyen, the warrant we acquired in Q2 of 2018 is valued at $1.1 billion at the end of Q4, an increase of $770 million year-on-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the plan of at least $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-K. For both of these investments, we remain excited about the optionality they provide, including the significant value each can generate for shareholders. Moving to guidance on Slide 13, given the limited visibility to potential outcomes in the longer term, we are providing guidance for the first quarter and we will reassess providing longer-term guidance at a later date. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.94 billion and $2.99 billion, growing between 35% to 37% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace's volume growth in the low 20s, driven by strength in e-commerce and continued improvements in our user experience. In addition, we expect further take rate expansion driven by ongoing strong execution in managed payments and advertising. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 to $1.08 per share, representing 49% to 57% growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS growth will be driven primarily by volume, lower share count, managed payments and advertising, partially offset by continued investments in product and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.81 to $0.86 per share in Q1. In February, our Board approved a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.18 per share. The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 1 with the payment date of March 19. Our Board has also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, with no expiration, raising the total authorization to approximately $6 billion. While we aren't guiding for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context for our path forward. On volume, while we are in early days, we feel great about the progress we are making on the strategy we've laid out, and believe these efforts will continue to deliver growth as we scale. In the near term, it is important to note that we will begin to lap significantly tougher comps toward the end of Q1. And looking at Q2 specifically, we will be facing into our peak level of growth in 2020, that was driven by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments around the world and supply chain disruptions that our globally distributed sellers were well positioned to overcome. We expect revenue will continue to outpace GMV as seller migration into managed payments nears completion. And we expect ads to continue to grow faster than volume on our way to the next $1 billion. On margin, we expect to continue to drive operational efficiency, while investing into higher rates of long-term revenue growth. We maintain our commitment of delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We expect to deliver strong free cash flow and we will continue to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends while being opportunistic with strategic M&A to accelerate our core strategy. Throughout 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet by leveraging favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt within our existing targets and tenants. We will continue to optimize our capital structure and recently announced our intention to call our retail bond that we plan to replace with debt at favorable rates in 2021. In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year. We added $14 billion of GMV and 11 million active buyers to our ecosystem. We executed in payments and advertising, which delivered a combined 7 points of incremental revenue growth compared to GMV for the year, 13 points in the fourth quarter. We processed over 38% of on-platform GMV through managed payments in the fourth quarter while improving experiences for buyers and sellers. We cleared $1 billion in advertising in the year, highlighted by 86% growth within promoted listings. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 49%, and delivered strong free cash flow of $2.7 billion. We executed a comprehensive portfolio review, including the divestiture of StubHub for $4 billion, the pending transfer of eCG assets at a favorable valuation and announced the decision to explore options for Korea in January. We returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, repurchasing $5.1 billion of our own shares, taking advantage of a market price that we do not believe reflects the value of our company. And in these imaginably tough times, we were there to help our employees, sellers, buyers and communities while delivering strong results for our shareholders. We exit 2020 having improved the underlying health of the business by delivering on the strategy we implemented this year. And we entered 2021 focused and excited to deliver on the next phase of the strategy as we build more compelling next-gen experiences, become the partner of choice for sellers and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. And now, we would be happy to answer your questions. Operator? Yes, Eric. And then on the second part of your question on comps and investments, clearly, there is a lot of noise now with what's going on with the pandemic, but that hasn't stopped or really changed the approach we have taken towards building towards longer term growth. It's given us a little bit of a tailwind to lean in a bit on investment. But the beauty of this model is as I said in my prepared remarks, we are committed to the 30% margin and we believe that we have got a very strong plan to get there. And we feel like we have done or made great progress on the initiatives this year, exiting the year stronger, certainly stronger than we entered and stronger than we had anticipated when we entered the year as we look at the controllable aspects of growth if you peel apart what we can see from COVID-related items. Got it. Hey, Ross, I'll take the first one. On Q4 dynamics and then the international versus U.S. split, it looks like there's a bit of a difference between U.S. and international growth rates, with the U.S. down 8 and international accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That's really less an impact of what we saw in the fourth quarter and more an impact of kind of the unwind of the second quarter spike and how third quarter rates played through. So keep in mind, in the U.S. in the third quarter, the growth rate \u2013 the deceleration from Q2 was a little less. So when we look at third quarter \u2013 or fourth quarter and how it plays through into the first, it's really for us more what we saw \u2013 what we've seen since September with some acceleration really in all \u2013 basically all countries around the world. And that's played through to the first quarter, and it's implied in the acceleration you see in our Q1 guidance. So clearly, mobility plays a large role in sustaining a level of growth and driving a bit of acceleration. But again, the initiatives we're working on and the progress we've made with regards to product and marketing and managed payments and search contribute as well to the acceleration on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But clearly, the majority of that's going to be mobility driven, but underlying performance is better. Yes. I mean, I think the only thing I'd add is, while we do \u2013 it's a pretty active playing field with what's coming with eCG and the like. I think if you look at historically what we've done with StubHub and some of the things in the past, you can expect it will be consistent in what we've done. Our tenants and targets are unchanged. And our number focus is do what we can to invest back in the business to grow organically, look at M&A, where it helps us to do that. We remain committed to shareholder return. And I just expect us to continue to do that. Yes. I'll take that one first. Just on the \u2013 it's a little similar to the question earlier. Based on the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, kind of the movement in U.S. versus international was relatively similar. So as we look into Q1, what we've seen thus far in the quarter and therefore implied in the guide is similar movements by country, so no real difference U.S. and international in terms of quarter-over-quarter dynamics. And then the first question, was it U.S. GMV only the deceleration? That one again \u2013 yes, sorry, Youssef. That one, I think, again, if you \u2013 is less an issue \u2013 or less a component of Q4 activity as much as it is a hangover in Q3 of the spike in Q2. So the U.S. \u2013 I mean we had clearly a very large volume spike in the second quarter. Volume in the U.S. hung in longer in the third quarter, partially as a result of stimulus, partially as a result of some of the supply chain disruption. And then as that slowed down through the end of the third quarter, some of that's what you're seeing play through in the quarter-over-quarter dynamics. But as I said, from September on, the activity by country has been relatively similar."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today's call with some key highlights from last quarter of last year, and walk you through an update on the progress of eBay's tech-led re-imagination. I will then turn the call over to Andy to discuss the details of our recent performance and near-term outlook. Overall, 2020 was a great year for sellers and buyers on eBay. We are pleased that we closed out the year with strong results. For Q4, gross merchandise volume in marketplaces grew 18%, well ahead of our expectations. The holiday season contributed to the strong performance as we saw record volume with high velocity in hard-to-find and sold-out items. Refurbished gifts also emerged as a top trend, and we saw many products from top brands in our certified refurbished experience sell out completely. Our buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the U.S., 1 in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. In Germany, that number was 1 in 7. And in the UK, it was 1 in 4. In addition to this holiday surge, we experienced unprecedented traffic levels for most of 2020, and yet our platform had the highest availability in the last 6 years. To put this in context, more than 100 days in 2020 exceeded peak 2019 traffic levels. eBay has been able to seamlessly handle these peaks, while keeping our marketplace open for all during a global pandemic. For the full quarter, revenue grew 10 points faster than volume, up 28% driven primarily by payments and advertising. And we delivered $0.86 in non-GAAP earnings per share, which was above our expectations and included reinvestments for the long-term. Our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace in the quarter. Active buyers grew 7% to $185 million globally, and our active seller base increased by 5% as more small business and consumer sellers listed and sold on the platform. These results capped off a tremendous year for eBay. In 2020, we added an incremental $14 billion of GMV, that's more growth in the past 7 years combined. Organic revenue grew 21% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 49%, and we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In July, I laid out a long-term vision for the company, and we have rearchitected our roadmap to achieve our tech-led reimagination over the next few years. We also made progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which drove tremendous financial results while providing customers with a significantly improved experience. We continue to make significant advancements with our managed payments transition, ending the year with over 1 million sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 38% of on-platform volume. In the U.S., we exited the year with over 50% of the migration complete. In addition to the 5 markets where we already launched, transitions have been announced or underway in France, Italy, Spain and Greater China. We have also started to transition consumer sellers in the U.S., UK, Canada and Germany. Seller satisfaction has improved compared to Q3 and NPS scores from sellers in managed payments remain more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Over the course of 2021, we plan to roll out payments to remaining markets, launch cross-border trade and release product capabilities for all use cases. This roadmap opens up managed payments to all sellers globally and places us firmly on our path toward 100% migration. As the vast majority of the transition will be complete by the end of this year, we are well positioned to deliver at least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating income annually in 2022. In Q4, advertising growth outpaced volume once again as sellers lean further into promoted listings to grow their business. For the quarter, promoted listings delivered over $215 million of revenue, up 57% despite having lapped a major product launch that drove strong acceleration a year ago. For the full year, promoted listings grew 86%. This product continues to grow, in part because sellers who have adopted promoted listings are seeing, on average, a double-digit sales increase. Our total advertising revenue reached a new milestone in 2020, passing $1 billion for the year. We see tremendous growth potential remaining as this represents approximately 1% of GMV, well below industry benchmarks. We expect advertising revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future. Now I'd like to share an update on the transfer of Classifieds to Adevinta. We remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. We believe the deal is on track to close as we have received the vast majority of regulatory approvals. We expect closure by the end of the first quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory approvals which we are working to obtain. We also recently announced that we are exploring options for our Korean business. Our 2 local platforms, Gmarket and IAC, have built leading e-commerce positions by tailoring to customer needs with innovative experiences. With a paid loyalty program of over 2.5 million members, and a growing first-party inventory program, these businesses primarily focus on new and seasoned products from B2C sellers with limited cross-border trade. As we mentioned in our press release, we will not be communicating any further information about the strategic review process until there is material information to disclose. I will now provide an update on the progress we have made towards our long-term vision for eBay. The three strategic priorities to support this vision remain the same: first, to defend our core by building compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts; second, to become the partner of choice for sellers; and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. In the past few months, we launched several new product experiences aligned with this vision. While we still have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the initial reaction from buyers and sellers and the acceleration in GMV in several categories. During the fall in the U.S., we launched authentication for luxury watches, and quickly rolled out a similar experience to sneakers a few weeks later. We have put a greater focus on protecting buyers and sellers by preventing counterfeits and eliminating fraudulent returns. These experiences are driving significantly higher-than-average customer satisfaction, and we see opportunities to expand this capability to other verticals and markets. This new product experience is driving material growth in these categories for U.S. business. For luxury watches over $2,000, we saw a double-digit increase in GMV growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by higher sell-through rates and higher average prices. For sneakers over $100, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in Q4. While some volume growth is due to the effects of the pandemic, significant growth drivers included the authentication rollout, pricing reductions and marketing changes. Sneaker buyer behavior is a great example of the power of the eBay platform. In 2020, the average customer who purchased a pair of sneakers over $100 spent a total of $2,500 on eBay. Approximately 80% of that spend was in categories outside of sneakers. We will continue to drive more cross-category shopping to grow GMV per buyer over time. To expand the buyer base, we are investing in new channels, including social marketing to reach more Gen Z and millennial customers. We launched a TikTok campaign called Lace \u2018Em Up, generating 4.7 billion views. And we also have been partnering with celebrities, famous athletes and influencers on exclusive promotions. Another area of non-new and season inventory we're focused on is outlet fashion. In the UK, we launched an optimized brand outlet experience with 150 fashion brands offering products at deep discounts. This contributed to strong double-digit GMV growth in fashion ahead of UK market rates. We also saw active listings double and active buyers in the category grew 30% in Q4. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision becoming the platform of choice for sellers. In addition to enhancements in payments and advertising, we continue to provide small businesses with more tools and capabilities to help them grow. In Q4, we added more automation and scale to sell our initiated offers. This uniquely eBay feature allows sellers to escape the limits of a buyback by enabling them to offer custom deals to individual buyers. For the year, seller-initiated offers drove over $1.2 billion of GMV. Another win for sellers on eBay in Q4 was in SEO. The work we have done in the past to optimize our platform for search engine ranking and visibility is paying off. SEO traffic is growing faster than paid channels and delivering more new buyers to small business sellers on eBay. Last, we continued to increase seller visibility in our native app by driving traffic to their eBay stores. 95% of our store subscribers have migrated to the newest experience, and they are seeing a 20% average increase in visits to their storefront. The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. A major focus for us has been the native app experience. In 2020, almost half of our global GMV was transacted in the app, and it continues to grow faster than the overall business as buyer and seller preferences evolved. We have maintained high ratings in both iOS and Android, and our app was downloaded more than 50 million times in 2020. To drive engagement from buyers on mobile, we have simplified item pages, made it easier to like or share an item and provided more exposure by creating direct access to seller stores. Additionally, we improved conversion by enhancing search relevance and streamlining sort and filter options, allowing app users to find what they are looking for faster. While we are focused on delivering our vision, we remain committed to keeping our purpose at the forefront by leveraging the power of our platform to support our communities. One way we did this last year was by helping to quickly and efficiently distribute PPE to frontline workers in the UK eBay partnered with the UK's National Health Service, the Department for Health and Social Care and logistic partners on this effort. I am proud to report that in December, the NHS PPE portal powered by eBay reached a significant milestone. Together, we delivered more than 1 billion PPE items to more than 45,000 social care providers in the UK. Another way the eBay platform provides opportunity is by enabling a thriving customer community that loves to give back. During the year that has been challenging for so many, the eBay for Charity community continues to be an inspiration. 2020 was a record-breaking year with nearly $123 million raised globally in charitable donations. The generosity showed by our buyers and sellers is amazing. The spirit of a global community centered around connection and economic opportunity for all is clearly alive and well. Over the course of 2020, eBay invested more than $100 million to support the growing needs of small businesses around the world through programs like Up & Running. These programs provided the access, training and resources needed to start selling online and connect new sellers to eBay's global community of buyers. And just last quarter, we announced further assistance through Up & Running grant program. In the coming weeks, we will reward a number of eBay U.S. small business sellers a grant package worth $10,000 each. As I have mentioned in the past, at eBay, we focus our sustainability initiatives on the most impactful goals that will help strengthen our business and provide the most value to all our stakeholders. And our commitment to climate action and transparency is being recognized externally. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America indices and recognized in the Carbon Disclosure Project A List for the first time. In the past year alone, we have avoided an additional 720,000 metric tons of carbon emissions through people selling their pre-owned electronics and apparel on eBay. In summary, we are making progress on our vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, and we have a clear roadmap for 2021 and beyond. Our payments transition is on track and will largely be completed this year. Our advertising business will continue to outpace volume through promoted listings and other products. As we defend the quarter, we plan to expand our new vertical experiences to more markets and innovate in more categories. To-date, we have only touched a single-digit percentage of our global GMV, but in the coming years, that will expand to a majority of volume. To build a platform of choice for sellers, we will continue to expand the stores experience and give sellers more tools to increase velocity. We will also leverage technology to dramatically simplify the end-to-end selling process for consumer and business sellers. To create more lifelong buyer relationships, we will connect with them through new channels, deepen their engagement with the eBay app and deliver trusted experiences when they shop with us. Last but not least, we will continue to invest in product and technology, and evolve how we spend marketing in order to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. I know we can accomplish all of this due to the fantastic team I have the privilege of leading. Our employees live our purpose in 2020, and I look forward to what we can do together for our customers in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy? Yes. Thanks, Eric. Let me take the first one on verticals and then Andy can take the second. So, we invested in those verticals really based on the strategy that we laid out in July of focusing on non-new and season and opportunities where we had strength to win. And if you look at those categories being watches, sneakers, which we rolled out surely after watches and then Certified Refurbished, we saw really great growth rates. I mentioned the triple-digit growth rate that we saw in sneakers. You got to remember, this was a business that had been in decline. And so to see it as strong as this shows us the power of really focusing on those verticals and the end-to-end experience for our customers. And so while those categories represent a single-digit percentage of our GMV, the plan is to continue to roll out new category experiences from an end-to-end perspective over the course of the coming years, eventually meeting the majority of our GMV. I will add that we included another area for us in the UK, where we piloted a fashion brand outlet with 150 fashion brand sellers performed really well, double-digit growth ahead of the market and ahead of what we expected. And so that kind of gives us the confidence that the strategy is working and the confidence to continue to rollout more categories over the coming quarters and years. Yes. So starting on the buyer ones, we acquired 11 million buyers over the course of the year. And what we're seeing is that the behavior, when we look at things like frequency and retention, is not different and is as strong as we've seen in past cohorts, which means they didn't just come to us for eBay to buy a specific PPE and then we won't see them again. We're doing a good job of turning a percentage of them into enthusiasts. And what we're really focused on is how do we turn them into cross-category shoppers. So as I mentioned in the remarks, a sneaker buyer who comes into eBay is going to be worth $2,500, or they end up buying $2,500 worth of GMV. But only 20% of that is in sneakers, and 80% of that will be in other categories across the site. And that's a huge advantage for us because of the cross-category nature that we have of the platform. And it's also a specific focus and something that we lean into a lot is driving it. And a lot of that growth is coming from C2C, and is bringing Gen Z and millennials to the platform, which is also critical and part of our strategy. In terms of the authentication, we've ramped up the amount of authenticating we're doing to now every sneaker over $100 going through the authentication platforms. And we're seeing great response and great operations there. So consumers are getting their sneakers really quickly, and the authentication process is working. And look, while it's a very, very small percentage of things that we find where there are issues that guarantee for customers is a huge differentiator and is a big part of what's leading to the triple-digit growth. So we're leaning in a lot in terms of marketing and acquiring those customers in that category, and we're excited for what we're seeing. Yes. And I'd say on the SEO, look, there's a number of things that we've been doing in terms of how we structure our listings and work with our content and designers that actually specifically drives it. There was some Google algorithmic change which we benefited from. And we've been doing some upper funnel, specifically in targeted verticals, which we think helps some of our lower-funnel activity. I think the important thing to remember is, in general, 80% of our traffic on the site is organic and people coming to us directly, and that's really one of the strengths and assets of eBay. But certainly, the SEO is helping us with our initiatives to drive cross-category purchase and drive consideration. Yes. So look, on the cross-marketing, I think it's been important for eBay. Since I was here the first time, it continues to be a really important thing when you look at driving the CLTV of our buyers. If I go back to the sneaker example, I talked about the 80% outside the category, and that represents them purchasing in 10 categories out of that core category. I would even broaden that question to say, we're really studying a lot that first kind of 90-day experience for a customer and looking at all the things that drive the retention of them. And so getting them to download the mobile app, getting them to shop across category, getting them to watch or save items and really driving more of our marketing technology to align to driving the retention of the buyers. And that's why we are excited to see that. A big reason why we also focused on C2C selling is because if we acquire that buyer to come in as a buyer and then we get them to just do any kind of casual selling, they become 2x to 2.5x more valuable to us as a buyer. So really that whole kind of introductory life cycle and being really algorithmic, and using our best data science and AI, really working on our marketing technology to be able to leverage that more is a key focus for us. And look, on the competitive landscape, we feel great about our positioning. We significantly improved the NPS of our experiences, especially in those focused verticals that we talked about. And we're seeing really good feedback from buyers and sellers. And that's always the leading indicator is that CSAT and NPS performance and what's happening there. And so that, combined with the payment CSAT stuff we're seeing where sellers that are moving to our payments 2.0, our managed payments platform, have a 10 point higher NPS, is making us feel really good about where our competitive positioning is. And last thing I'd say is just thinking about the scale, right? So we talked about $14 billion GMV that we grew year-on-year last year. That's more than the last 7 years combined. That's more than most vertical competitors would do in a year, we grew more than that amount. So being able to leverage those 185 million buyers, and have their purchasing cross-category is a huge and unique asset for eBay. Yes. So first, on the advertising business, feel great about hitting the $1 billion milestone. As we look at it, a lot of that growth is being driven by the growth of promoted listings. And as we analyze it, we're seeing better seller penetration of people coming on the platform, better technology and tools in terms of our ability to do relevance, and we're not seeing it degrade the buyer experience, which is what gives us comfort that when we look at it in total being 1% of our total GMV that we have the opportunity to continue to have advertising growth faster than our GMV on the platform, and really based on that strength of promoted listings. On your question on managed payments, absolutely, it's a huge part of the win is really streamlining the payment process and providing more payment options. Cross-border trade for us has always been a great business, a really unique business to eBay and specifically in the Greater China corridor and helps us bring on new buyers to the platform and a different type of inventory. So between what we're doing in terms of speed pack and some of the forward deployed inventory, plus now as we expand payments to Greater China, we think that will help a number of the quarters in terms of our cross-border trade business. Yes, there is really nothing different about our thinking towards capital allocation. Our model gives us the flexibility to both invest back in our business organically and opportunistically to look at M&A as well as return capital to shareholders. Our business generates a high amount of free cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. And I think we have a track record of both exercising discipline in our portfolio as well as maximizing value for shareholders. So we'll continue to look opportunistically at M&A and do so for tech and talent or areas that we believe are going to accelerate the strategy that we laid out in July. Andy, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. So, first on the Gen Z and millennials, absolutely, it's a huge area of why we are focused on pre-owned not only because of the attractiveness there, but also just the impact on the planet. If you look at the numbers that we talked about from saving 720,000 metric tons of carbon emission, we recently did a survey, it probably sounds like much of the survey that you've done. And what we saw is that 72% of our sellers that come and start selling on the platform are doing so because they need to earn a little bit of extra money and some percentage of those are actually because they lost their job, and so they're looking for opportunities on just making money on the platform. The other thing that's important to remember is that we believe that people have about $4,000 of items in their house that they can sell, less than 20% of that is online. And so there's a huge kind of social element which we're leaning into as part of that, but definitely a focus on the Gen Z millennials. And you're seeing that in sneakers, you're seeing that in what we did with our brand fashion outlet in the U.K., and you'll see us continue to focus on attracting that customer to the platform. And before you do, I forgot that I didn't answer your advertising question. So let me just cover that one real quickly. So look, we believe that ads is beneficial for us because we essentially have a closed platform. We're able to drive the majority of that growth through promoted listings, where we actually can see the actual relevance, the implications, the click-throughs, all of the data that makes that impactful. So yes, that gives us, I think, a lot of bullishness in terms of the future opportunity for us in advertising, especially since we're only penetrated at 1% of GMV. And we think there is opportunities to continue to expand the number of sellers that use the platform as well as build new capabilities to make that platform even more attractive with some new tools, etcetera, which you'll see over the coming quarters and coming years. Yes. Go ahead. Sorry about that. I think it was just about U.S. versus international for Q1 guidance. Yes. Sure, Bob. So look, the increase in buyer is, in part, doing a lot of the strategic work that we're doing and the focus verticals, you saw us do more marketing in the quarter, really talking about some of the new capabilities that we have out there. And we leaned in from a reinvestment standpoint to not only acquire those buyers, but to really to work on driving the retention of those buyers into our key platforms. So obviously, in a number of countries, it's also pandemic-related relative to mobility, but we've also been leaning in to kind of take advantage of that and drive their cohort curves. And we've been impressed that we've been seeing from that perspective. In terms of the makeup of different format, Buy It Now remains the vast majority of what's on the platform. We do see strength in auctions in areas like collectibles, which is a category that's growing strong for us. But not only does Buy It Now remains strong, but we've innovated over the years in things like best offer and in seller-initiated offers. And seller-initiated offers, as an example, is almost the inverse the best offer. Best offer is the buyer making an offer. Sellers can actually make specific individual offers to sellers who have interacted with one of their products, and we're doing $1.2 billion already in that. It's one of the unique elements of the eBay platform as auctions, best offers, seller-initiated offers are all ways for buyers and sellers to get to a negotiated price on the platform. But overall, Buy It Now still remains the vast majority of the business. Yes. So look, the buying behavior that we saw over the course of the year, it started in PPE equipment, then went to kind of stuff that people needed to work-from-home or stay-at-home, things like fitness equipment and laptops and that type of thing. But after that, it was really broad-based and continues to be broad-based in terms of where we're acquiring buyers. So, from everything from people spending time with their hobbies and parts and accessories or fixing up their cars to Certified Refurbished on what we are doing there, we are definitely seeing strength in buyer acquisition and the focused verticals that we have been talking about. So like apparel that we worked on in the quarter with the brand fashion outlet and in the areas that we announced in the U.S. and we will be expanding globally. So more important for us is not where we acquire them, but getting really smart and using a lot of AI about what's the best second category, how we're using all of our tools and capabilities across marketing and the apps and the websites to get them to interact in different parts of the business. And that's where I think about it just getting a little bit better every single day in how we're able to do that is going to be what continues to help drive those numbers. From an ads perspective, we're focused on the tools and capabilities to make it easier for sellers to use the product to give them templating and reporting of how it's doing and be able to have that closed-loop ROI on the spend that they have on the platform to make it more applicable to C2C sellers and make it really easy there, because obviously if you think about a sophisticated B2C seller, it's easier to interact with and much easier understands in advertising product. So, that's a big component of what we're doing. And then also just building new algorithms and relevance and machine learning into are we displaying the best thing to the buyers. So we continue to expand the program while not degrading the buying experience and, ideally, enhancing the buyer experience through what we're doing on our advertising products. So what you'll see is just continued quarter-after-quarter innovation in that product to help us keep the \u2013 grow the \u2013 and reach the potential of the product and have it continue to outpace GMV for the near and medium term. Yes."

Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie's and Andy's remarks represent FX neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise. In this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements including without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of October 28, 2020 and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today I'll walk you through some of the key highlights from the quarter and update you [technical difficulty] of the company. Then I will turn the call over to Andy to discuss our recent performance and near-term outlook. Before I do that, I'd like to take a moment and reflect on a major milestone eBay passed last month. 25 years ago during Labor Day Weekend, our Founder Pierre launched eBay as a technology experiment. The aspiration was to create an open, fair, and trusted marketplace that empowered people and created [ph] economic opportunities for all. Since our inception, eBay pioneered online shopping, has become an iconic brand that has shaped the modern e-commerce landscape. We are very proud of our accomplishments and today we connect over 183 million buyers to nearly 90 million sellers around the world in a broad and diverse set of categories. We are operating during historic times when our buyers and sellers need us most, while supporting our employees who are working hard to meet the needs of our customers and adjusting [ph] to their own reality. As we look ahead to the next 25 years, our business become the best global marketplace to buy and sell goods through our tech lead re-imagination [technical difficulty]. I will come back to this in a moment, but first let me talk about our most recent achievements. In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Earlier this month, we updated how we report classified [ph], but to be clear on apples-to-apples basis, we performed better than expectations on both the top and bottom-lines. Gross merchandise volume and marketplace 21%. To put that in perspective, we added over 4 billion in volume in Q3 versus last year, more than many businesses do annually. Active buyers increased over 183 million globally, organic revenue grew faster than volume, up 26% driven by payments and advertising. Migration made significant progress in Q3 and is giving [ph] buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-end experience. Starting with five of our largest markets, we focused first on transitioning business sellers to the payments form. As a result, we ended the quarter with over 340,000 sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 20% of on platform volume. Additionally, we informed sellers that we are expanding manage payments to France, Italy, and Spain in early 2021. And we will begin to migrate consumer sellers in Q4 in the U.S. We remain on track and expecting the vast majority of our transition by the end of next year. So, our feedback has been encouraging as NPS from sellers [technical difficulty] payments has averaged more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Buyers love the flexibility, choice, and ease of use. We're seeing new and reactivated buyers, ultimate forms of payment, like credit and debit cards, Google pay and Apple Pay across the majority of their purchases. We were confident that we are on pace to deliver $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in income [technical difficulty] basis by 2022. Advertising growth continues to be driven by promoted listings, which continue to outpace volumes, a trend we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. In the third quarter, promoted listings delivered $186 million of revenue, up 77%. We are providing sellers with more data-driven recommendations to optimize their ad conversion, while we test and build more technology features to drive future growth and position eBay [technical difficulty]. Now turning to Classifieds. We believe that the transfer of Classifieds [technical difficulty] is on track to be completed in Q1 2021 subject to regulatory approvals. We're excited to bring together the two highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. The market agrees as evidenced by the appreciation of Adevinta share price, which increased in value of eBay from $9.2 billion to over $11 billion based on recent trading levels. As you may recall, last quarter, I outlined a long-term vision for eBay. Through a tech-lead re-imagination, we realize the enormous untapped potential of our marketplace and drive sustainable long-term growth. We have three strategic priorities to support this vision. First, to defend our core by better compelling next gen experiences for RCVs. Second, to become the partner of choice for sellers, and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. We are in the first phase of multiyear journey that many improvements for buyers and sellers yet to come. But over the past quarter, we were able to take several steps towards realizing this vision decision. As I mentioned, our first priority is all about defending our core business. Our focus here is on non-newest using products and simplifying consumer selling. We're taking a holistic view of customer needs, responding and launching features to address those needs, and rapidly changing the approach leveraging scalable technology across [technical difficulty] categories. A great example of that is the series of changes we made to our luxury watch category. Recently, we launched authenticity guarantee on all watches above $2,000. [ph]. This increases confidence both buyers and sellers. Buyers can do a meticulous verification by third-party experts and sellers are protected from [technical difficulty] returns. In addition, we announced an [technical difficulty] for high-dollar transactions plus new app content for watch enthusiast and we also reduce fees for sellers. While this service is still in its early stages, we starting to see a modest increase in supply and higher average selling prices. We've also turned our focus to the sneakers category, which attracts passionate enthusiast, particularly GenZ and Millennials. In the US, sneaker GMV has significantly improved from a year ago. These buyers and sellers bring tremendous value to our ecosystem. An average sneaker buyer purchases in 10 unique categories each year more than double the amount of other eBay buyers. Leveraging similar technology launched in watches, we expanded the authenticity guarantee to sneakers. We're requiring all collectible sneakers both new and pre-owned above $100 to be verified by a team of independent third-party industry experts. The program kicked off with the authentication of our most popular brands and styles and will scale that all sneakers sales over $100 next year. A year ago, we were losing share in this important category. But now we're seeing over 50% [technical difficulty] growth year-to-date and that was before launching the authenticity guarantee. And just last week, we announced the launch of new elevated experience for certified refurbished product. We see tens of billions of dollars in untapped potential in the global refurbished market. Through our new certified refurbished program, buyers can save up to 50% unlike new branded inventory with all the assurances of buying new including a two-year warranty, eBay money back guarantee, and hassle free 30 day returns. We are launching this program in partnership with globally recognized brands, including [technical difficulty] and Fila, that was all certified refurbished inventory exclusively on eBay, not only does this program help with buyers budgets leading into the holiday season, it also helps to eliminate unnecessary waste by keeping products in circulation for many years to come. We see a long runway to accelerate GMV growth given the $500 billion global total addressable market, we are competing for, but it will take time. By leveraging scalable technology, we can uniquely address the needs of customers across a diverse mix of categories in electronics, fashion, collectibles, home and garden, parts and accessories, and more. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. Over the past three months, in addition to enhancements in managed payments and advertising, we continue to leverage the scale of eBay to benefit small businesses. We worked closely with UPS to offer new shipping services for sellers on our platform. In addition to a direct integration with eBay labels, sellers now have access to discounted rates saving them time and money. Sellers also have access to order details, customer information, label printing and shipment tracking all in one place and buyers benefit from lower shipping costs and integrated tracking. Additionally, we are supporting seller profitability during the upcoming holiday season by working with the carriers on our platform to eliminate peak season shipping surcharges on eBay. Recently, we rolled out--\nJoe Billante: Can you pause for one second? We're getting some feedback on the line, we're working through, a technical issue, can you give us a moment. [technical difficulty]\nJamie Iannone: Hi, in the midst of repeating myself, I'm going to go back a little bit just to make sure, because I understand the line got fuzzy which we apologize about the technical difficulties. So, we also turned our focus to the sneakers category, which attracts passionate enthusiast, particularly GenZ and Millennials. In the U.S., sneaker GMV has significantly improved from a year ago. These buyers and sellers bring tremendous value to our ecosystem. An average sneaker buyer purchases in 10 unique categories each year more than double the amount of other eBay buyers. Leveraging similar technology launched in watches, we expanded the authenticity guarantee to sneakers. We required all collectible sneakers both new and pre-owned above $100 to be verified by a team of independent third-party industry experts.

And just last week, we announced the launch of new elevated experience for certified refurbished product. We see tens of billions of dollars in untapped potential in the global refurbished market.  Through our new certified refurbished program, buyers can save up to 50% unlike new branded inventory with all the assurances of buying new including a two-year warranty, eBay money back guarantee, and hassle free 30 day returns. We are launching this program in partnership with globally recognized brands, including De'Longhi, Dirt Devil, Hoover, Nikita, and Fila, that was all certified refurbished inventory exclusively on eBay, not only does this program help with buyers budgets leading into the holiday season, it also helps to eliminate unnecessary waste by keeping products in circulation for many years to come. We see a long runway to accelerate GMV growth given the $500 billion global TAM, we are competing for, but it will take time. By leveraging scalable technology we can uniquely address the needs of customers across a diverse mix of categories in electronics, fashion, collectibles, home and garden, parts and accessories, and more. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. Over the past three months, in addition to enhancements in managed payments and advertising, we continue to leverage the scale of eBay to benefit small businesses. We worked closely with UPS to offer new shipping services for sellers on our platform. In addition to a direct integration with eBay label, sellers now have access to discounted rates saving them time and money. Sellers also have access to order details, customer information, label printing and shipment tracking all in one place. And buyers benefit from lower shipping costs and integrated tracking. Additionally, we are supporting seller profitability during the upcoming holiday season by working with the carriers on our platform to eliminate peak season shipping surcharges on eBay. Recently, we rolled out an upgraded communication system that allows buyers and sellers to connect securely on our platform. Also, we have provided small businesses, a new marketing tool to drive traffic back to their eBay stores through our affiliate platform. And just in time for the holidays, last month, we expanded the time away functionality, making it easier for sellers to update their listings and protect their on-time delivery record while providing buyers more accurate shipping estimates. Looking forward, we are embarking on a multi-quarter journey to improve selling flows that leverage more AI capabilities to dramatically simplify selling and drive more growth for small businesses. The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationship with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. In Q3, we improved search results, which would lead to material increases in conversion by including more behavioral data, we were able to optimize machine learning algorithms at the top of the funnel that led to improved buyer engagement and ultimately, led to increased purchases. These technology advances generate significant impact, as every incremental point of conversion creates almost $1 billion more GMV annually. More importantly, buyers are discovering the items they are searching for in faster and simpler way. Another way we are building trusted relationships with buyers is by improving our shipping tracking. In the U.K. and Australia, we developed a unique new capability to implement virtual tracking for Royal Mail and Australia Post leading to significant increases in tracking coverage. Sellers do not have to explicitly provide information and buyers can track orders with confidence. We will continue to invest in the buyer experience and marketing technology capabilities as we work to foster lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. Finally, an area that I and the team are extremely passionate about is doing good for our communities around the world. We focused initiatives on the sustainability issues material for the long-term strength of our business. And where we can be most impactful to our stakeholders. We have measurable and transparent goals to alert, evaluate our progress and to hold ourselves accountable to these important milestones. Such as driving more circular commerce getting to 100% renewable energy by 2025 and raising significant amounts for charitable causes. We began eBay for Charity in 2003 to make it easier for customers to support their favorite charities, since then we've raised over $1 billion for charities around the world. And we're working hard on our goal of another $600 million raised by 2025. In Q3, eBay for Charity began working alongside international artists through a campaign called Artists Band Together. We are helping to raise funds for organizations that work to increase voter turnout for the upcoming U.S. elections. Additionally, eBay Foundation reached its $1 million Kiva lending goal to support global untapped entrepreneurs through an employee micro-lending initiatives. At eBay, everything we do ties back to our purpose of creating economic opportunity for all and I'm very proud of our team for keeping this in the forefront especially during these remarkable times. So, in summary, we have a clear vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, while we have made meaningful progress in Q3, we still have a long way to go. We are investing in technology and focused on delivering the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. And I want to thank all of our employees who have been working diligently to support our customers by bringing our tech led re-imagination to life. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?\nAndy Cring: Thanks Jamie and thank you all for joining today. Before I walk you through the results for the quarter, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some additional context on the financial reporting impact of moving our Classifieds business to discontinued operations. With that designation, our reported results reflect only the performance of our marketplace business. The Q3 results for Classifieds are reflected in GAAP EPS from discontinued operations. You can find the presentation of historical financial statements, recap to the current presentation in the Form 8-K we published on October 1st. When we last provided guidance in July, Classifieds was included in both our Q3 and full year 2020 guidance assumptions. On slide four, you will see a refreshed look at what our July guidance would have been if we had excluded Classifieds. This will help create an apples-to-apples comparison versus our Q3 results reported today. Let me quickly walk -- let me quickly walk you through the numbers. Adjusting for the Classifieds impact to our July guidance, the implied Q3 guide for marketplaces was between $2.38 billion and $2.45 billion of revenue growing 16% to 19% on an organic FX-neutral basis, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.68 and $0.74 per share, representing 31% to 42% growth. On slide five, we've made a similar adjustment for our full year guide. Adjusting for Classifieds, the implied full year 2020 guide for marketplaces revenue was between $9.59 billion and $9.78 billion, growing 14% to 16% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP EPS between $3.04 and $3.16 per share, and GAAP EPS between $2.51 and $2.66 per share. And finally, free cash flow adjust to the range of $2.2 billion to $2.35 billion. With that, I will move on to our current quarter results. Turning to our Q3 highlights on slide six. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, up 26% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.85, up 64%. Both were significantly above our expectations. Non-GAAP margin came in strong at 30.7%, inclusive of our ongoing investment in managed payments. We generated $584 million of free cash flow. We executed $700 million of share repurchases, and delivered $111 million in cash dividends in the quarter. Our Q3 over-performance was driven by a number of factors including our migration to managed payments, strong execution in advertising and volume growth ahead of our expectations. Based on our Q3 results and an improved topline outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year guidance, which I will cover in more detail in the guidance section. Moving to active buyers on slide seven, we ended the third quarter with 183 million active buyers representing 5% year-on-year growth, consistent with the second quarter. New and reactivated buyers continue to drive year-on-year growth. We continue to see strength in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts in Q3. While we initially saw stronger activity levels from buyers acquired in Q1 and Q2, those buyers are now trending toward behavior more consistent with historical cohorts. Moving to slide eight, in Q3, we enabled $25 billion of marketplace GMV, up 21% year-on-year, decelerating eight points versus the prior quarter as global mobility continue to improve, particularly in our international on-platform markets. In the U.S., we generated $9.8 billion of GMV, up 33% year-on-year, decelerating two points from the second quarter. Growth was at its peak in July and then moderated through August and September driven in part by the wind down of government stimulus payments even as residential mobility remained relatively constant. International GMV was up 14% year-on-year, a 12 point deceleration versus the second quarter driven by moderation in Germany and the U.K. We saw strong ongoing correlation between mobility restrictions and GMV growth across our international markets, where the most pronounced growth deceleration occurred in markets with the biggest increases in mobility. In our off-platform Korean business, growth was 4%, decelerating one point from the second quarter. Looking closer at volume, we continue to assess the impact of COVID to better understand the overall performance of our business. We have seen modestly improved underlying performance versus our pre-COVID 2020 plan driven by increased velocity and product experience improvements and ongoing tailwind from the recent increases in our active buyer base. In addition, we've seen temporary COVID-related growth acceleration in GMV that we expect will continue to moderate as mobility increases over time. And with this component being the biggest wild card in terms of magnitude and timing, it remains difficult to predict results beyond the near-term. Turning to revenue on slide nine, our net revenue was $2.6 billion, up 26% organically, decelerating two points. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, up 28% down five points from the second quarter with strength in payments and advertising partially offsetting the deceleration in GMV. Looking closer at managed payments, the increased seller adoption and high customer satisfaction that Jamie mentioned that's five points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019 on a continuing operations basis. Approximately one point better than anticipated. Transaction take rate was 9.4% for the quarter, accelerating nearly 40 basis points from Q2, primarily from the ramp of managed payments and the continued strength in promoted listings. We expect take rate to continue to increase further as managed payments and promoted listings continue to scale. We delivered $251 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 1% accelerating 15 points from the second quarter, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of best for friends in the middle of Q3 2019 and our first-party growth in Korea. Turning to slide 10 and major cost drivers as a percentage of revenue. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30.7%. This is approximately 4 points higher year-on-year, driven by volume leverage, partially offset by continuing investments in managed payments and strategic reinvestments. Cost of revenue was down nearly 20 basis points year-on-year as volume leverage is partially offset by managed payments and are expanding first-party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over two points versus the prior year as volume leverage was partially offset by strategic reinvestments in online marketing brand and our vertical strategy. Product development costs were down approximately 10 basis points, driven by volume leverage, partially offset by incremental investments in the product experience including managed payments. G&A was down nearly 40 basis points, primarily from leverage and cost control. Transaction losses were down one point as bad debt rates have performed better than expected. Turning to EPS on slide 11, in Q3, we delivered $0.85 of non-GAAP EPS, up 64% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher revenue growth and our share repurchase program, partially offset by our investment in managed payments and FX. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.88, up 250% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the change in fair value of the Adyen warrant and the same factors as non-GAAP performance, in addition to lapping the divestiture of brands for friends. The value of the Adyen warrant stands at $777 million at the end of Q3, an increase of $573 million year-over-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant and our 10-Q, and as always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to slide 12, we generated $584 million of free cash flow in Q3 down 18% driven by the timing of cash taxes, partially offset by higher earnings. Year-to-date through the third quarter, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion up nearly 30% year-on-year. Moving to slide 13, we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and investments, and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q3, we paid down over $900 million in debt, bringing our total debt, back to the 2019 year-end balance of $7.8 billion. This completes actions taken in 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt. Additionally, we paid over $700 million in income taxes from the divestiture of StubHub which is presented in operating cash flow from discontinued operations, leaving approximately $250 million to pay in Q4. We returned $111 million to shareholders and dividends in the quarter. We executed $700 million in share buybacks in Q3, bringing our total share buyback to $4.7 billion so far this year. We entered Q4 with $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization remaining. Our capital allocation strategy and key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our BBB plus credit rating, mid-term leverage of approximately one and a half times net debt and gross debt below three times EBITDA, and a target cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Moving to slide 14, I'd like to provide an update on the pending Classifieds transaction. We remain excited about this deal as it allows us to realize near-term value while enabling us to participate in the future upside potential of the world's largest online classifieds company. We are on track to close the deal in Q1 subject to regulatory approvals. When we announced the deal on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and net of shares. The share price has appreciated by over 30% which increases the value of the Classifieds business to over $11 billion based on recent trading levels. Finally, we expect that the cash portion of the deal will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any potential future sale of shares would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate. Turning to slide 15, in guidance. We continue to operate in an environment with low visibility which proves to be very difficult when trying to provide guidance. Each month, sometimes each week reveals new external drivers that can have a material impact on consumer behavior. The dynamics we faced in Q3 were different from what we've faced in Q2 and it's clear that Q4 will be different than what we experienced in Q3. The shape and speed of pandemic recovery, the strength of the holiday season and the size and timing of potential government stimulus programs are among the many variables that could have a significant impact on our outlook. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.71 billion, growing 19% to 22% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace volume growth at low double-digit rates with gradual moderation through the quarter. We expect managed payments to continue to deliver revenue acceleration contributing approximately eight points to Q4 revenue at the midpoint of our guide, driven by continued seller migration. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 to $0.84 per share, representing 18% to 27% growth. Non-GAAP EPS growth is driven primarily by volume and lower share count partially offset by continuing investments in technology and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share in Q4. After adjusting for Classifieds moved to discontinued operations, this Q4 guide represents a material improvement on volume, revenue, and non-GAAP EPS versus our expectations back in July. For the full year, our revenue guidance is $10.04 billion to $10.11 billion, representing an organic FX-neutral growth rate of 19% to 20%, driven by an improved GMV outlook and continued scaling of managed payments and advertising. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.5% with the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15% to 16%. With the above dynamics, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.34 to $3.40 per share driven by Q3 over performance and an improved topline outlook for the fourth quarter. We now expect free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, capex in the range of 4% to 5% of revenue, and we are increasing our outlook on share repurchases to approximately $5 billion for the full year. Finally, we expect GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3 to $3.06 per share. In closing, we are excited about the progress we've made this quarter. Externally, the macro environment is helping to drive strong business performance. Internally, with the leadership team now solely focused on the marketplaces business, we're making progress with our new strategy. We're pleased by the increase in speed of execution demonstrated by our launching authenticity guarantee across multiple categories, rolling out our certified refurbish program, expanding shipping services, and tracking and helping buyers find items in faster and simpler ways. We're doing all of this while delivering on our revenue growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising which are both becoming critical material pieces of our financial architecture. Our margin commitments remain in place and we're on track to deliver at least two points of operating margin growth by 2022 as compared with 2019. As we've said in the past, we will continue to balance topline growth and margin expansion as we find new opportunities we will capitalize on them to drive growth. We remain focused on improving the underlying health of the marketplaces business. And as we've mentioned, this is going to be a multi-year journey. Although it's early, the results tell us, we're on the right track furthering our conviction to compete and win in the $0.5 trillion total addressable market we're focused on. And now, Jamie and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Devitt of Stifel. Your line is open.\nScott Devitt: Hi, and thank you. In Q3, items sold decelerated a bit more than GMV. I was wondering what caused that, whether it's some changes in ASP driven by category mix or was there some other factor at play there? And then secondly, this was partly answered but, in 4Q, I think you fully comp the sales tax collection implementation. It was 600 basis point headwind in 4Q '19. You did just a 22% in Q3. And I think that also had a 3% headwind in it. It does seem like we're going to have limited mobility again this quarter certainly in the U.S. and there were some announcements today in certain countries in Europe. In 4Q, you guided to low-double-digit GMV growth, I'm just wondering is there anything that you're seeing in the business that is leading to that or is that just more as you discussed a bit on the call staying consistent with this conservative approach of guidance given the uncertain business conditions, it seems to have been the case on the 1Q and 2Q guide as well. Thank you.\nAndy Cring: I'll start with the question on guide and Scott, to your point, there is new information coming out on a daily basis, which makes this tough. I think the way that we've looked at it, clearly, there is multiple factors moving that can influence our volume outlook for the quarter. It's really hard to predict how any of them will play out and certainly to try to itemize which pieces we've included for which amount. We can't do at this point. What we have tried to do with our guide is compile what we've learned through the third quarter and what we've seen. And it implies a continued growth moderation in the fourth quarter following what we saw in the third, and what we're seeing the beginning of the fourth with regards to consumer behavior and mobility. What we provided, I wouldn't call it conservative, I think it's our best outlook based on the combination of these factors, and certainly any one of those could change and could impact our results. On the -- I think you called it right on the sold items, there's GMV and category mix and similar to what you see on buyers and what you see on GMV there's just a magnitude of things changing on a quarter-over-quarter basis given the breadth of categories that we have in the different price tranches. I think you called it, right.\nScott Devitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Kramer of Arete Research. Your line is open.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you very much. Jamie, I've got two questions. The first is, I'd like to get some more detail on your tech-led re-imagination, especially given that you've seen declining R&D and relatively low capex. So, specifically, can you talk a little bit about how eBay might be developing infrastructure for social commerce, be it with more modern messaging, video or some material revamp of what's been a very consistent user experience and look and feel. And then maybe second question, since you mentioned, eBay is being a global marketplace when we last got the geographical detail, you had roughly 80% of your business in four countries and a very wide range of markets, covering the other fifth. So, what's your approach going to be to reaching scale and other countries? And how important is that global footprint to you and what sort of investment requirements do you see in 2021 and beyond to make eBay go beyond 80% coming just from those four markets? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on the first one on the tech-led re-imagination, it's why you see us making the investments that we're making is that, we believe that there is some big horizontal things that really move the business like payments and advertising. We're obviously putting a lot of technology focus. And then you saw this quarter, some specific vertical experiences of focus for us in both watches and sneakers and also in certified refurbish. And so we actually think this is the start of really leveraging our technology, we are horizontal plus vertical focus brings together just a much different experience on eBay. You think about the level of trust that we just put in place in those three categories. So, it's really game-changing versus where we were before. You asked specifically about marketing, there is a lot of things that we're dealing specifically in, paid social and using new channels that we haven't used before. That's a key part of it for us. If you think about the sneaker category, as an example, we're bringing on a lot of GenZ and Millennials. So, we're going out, reaching them where they are. Because when we enquire them in the sneaker category as we said, they end up buying in 10 unique categories across the site. The second thing I'd say on our footprint is, look, we've got some very strong growth in some of our smaller markets. There is a lot of advantage to the scale of our cross-border trade business where we're bringing products from very different countries to our smaller countries or exporting out of our smaller countries and obviously play a role in that. So, we continue to believe that those are important good growth opportunities, not only for the domestic business, but also for the cross-border trade that they bring.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thanks. Good quarter. I guess given some of the concerns around carrier capacity during the holiday period, I'm wondering it's a long tail of sellers, if they are more impacted by that or are your contracts with the shippers largely protecting them from those bottlenecks. And then looking at active buyer growth, what's the potential to accelerate that growth over the near-term certainly, given the secular shift we're seeing? Or are you more focused in terms of the marketing efforts on driving engagement with the existing buyers in the recent cohort ads? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on carrier capacity, part of why we did the UPS deal this year was to open up more flexibility and more options for our sellers. So not only are they going to save a bunch on the rate that they're going to have on there, but the integration is going to make it really easy for sellers and provide all that tracking for buyers. So, now you have multiple options even as a small consumer seller between USPS UPS and FedEx, one of the things we have worked on is deals that actually protect them from peak shipping charges or surcharges over the holiday. So, we think the combination of that flexibility of choices, plus the negotiating on behalf of our community, we'll work out well for them on the shipping side. On the active buyer growth as we talked about, our real third priority is turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts. So really focusing on how do we, when we bring in a new buyer expand them into multiple categories, because we know that drives their LTV, so I use the sneakers example earlier coming in via sneakers and they are buying in 10 categories. It's also a big vision for our push-to-consumer selling. This quarter, I actually see the fee GMV growth grew faster than our B2C growth. And that push is really because once we get to a buyer to sell, they become more than twice as valuable as a buyer, so that's really our focus is on accelerating those things and driving that long-term potential of the people that we're bringing to the site.\nColin Sebastian: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon. On GMV trends, it looks like the growth between the US and international is really starting to diverge with international decelerating more. I'm just curious, what do you think might account for that or whether it's all explained by mobility. And then on managed pay, it sounds like you added about 300,000 sellers into the program this quarter and add 5% of revenue. That seems like it's about $130 million in revenue. Is this approximately the right magnitude? Thank you.\nAndy Cring: Yes, I'll take the -- on the third quarter volume, U.S. international, look; there are differences we see globally. We indicated on our -- on the call in July that we were seeing continued strength through the month of July in the U.S. Post-July, we did see some increased moderation in August and September. And we think at least in part driven by the expiration of the US stimulus. So that, in part, I think is a little bit of strength you're seeing in the U.S. In addition to, if you look at mobility and the progress of COVID, internationally there was a little more mobility sooner, in particularly in Germany and the U.K. than we had in the U.S. So, I don't think there is a drastic business shift between any of those regions other than some of the dynamics associated with the reopening. I think another important, you have just generally on volume. We have there's a few things we do see that consumer behavior patterns are definitely impacted by mobility that is different depending on location and country and sometimes state. And I think the other, the other key thing is that the customer and consumer behavior patterns aren't the same, so as mobility and lockdown happened in April and May, we had more time and less scarcity, some of that behavior is not as drastic as you -- as we saw early on in the pandemic. And then on the second part of the question, was managed payments. Yeah, your logic is about right on that.\nTom Champion: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: All right. Thank you. So, Jamie for some of these categories that you're leaning into like watches and sneakers, it seems like there is a greater requirement to work with external parties through you to authenticate refurbished thing. So, to some degree you are putting the eBay brand at risk here with your buyers. So what are you, what incremental things are you doing to, that the seller, so that you minimize bad behavior? And second on the C2C activity ramp, it seems like consumers are not always going to be savvy, some of the more professional sellers about probably planning the correct prescriptions for what they're selling, and you also want to get merchandise and all kinds of different conditions which seems like a pretty complicated structured data problem for your engineers to solve. So, can you talk about what you're doing to make sure that stuff people are putting up for sale or correctly serve first in search results? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on the first one -- thank you for the question. We work with really industry leading experts to do the authentication specific for that category and a very intense multipoint inspection to make sure, the product is truly authentic. And so it really kind of not only you have to trust it kind of seller piece in there, but every single product, every single sneakers over $100 by the start of next year, will actually go through a third party authenticator. And so really takes the risk away of a potential issue by the time it gets to the buyer, even sometimes there could be a mistake, it was missing a piece of documentation. So, the beauty is, we're catching all of those things. The same thing in the returns. On making sure, and the seller is getting back the product that they actually ship the buyer, because the authentication works in both directions. So, look, it's a really high level of trust, when you look at the community feedback that we've got, and both from sellers and buyers, they're incredibly enthusiastic. They know it will bring a lot of new buyers to the platform, and for sellers, that's what they want. Like we said on the call, the business was growing 50% in sneakers even before we launched this authentication guarantees. So, we're excited by it. On the C2C ramp, it's a huge focus for us, it's using artificial intelligence and technologies to make it easier for the casual lister to come on and list. So, a lot of our listers will use things like sell similar, whether sell a similar product or they sell based on a specific catalog description. And what you'll see from us over the coming quarters is continuing to make that process easier to bring more to C2C sellers on. It's our, number 1 priority is defending the core and a huge part of that is consumer-selling. I should say that they also bring a unique inventory to the platform. There is a lot of things that are not being sold by a business seller. My -- one of my friends was looking for a guitar, [Indiscernible] hero and that's always, no one selling that B2C anymore, you're only going to get that from a C2C seller. So, we'd like to think about the unique inventory that it brings to the platform is also really important to us.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali, Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions here. So, just on the authenticity guarantee that you've done for sneakers and watches so far, can you maybe just speak to, and I think you also canceled some seller fees on sneakers of $100 or more. Can you maybe just speak to and maybe it's too early, but just any uplift you've seen in and sales for these two particular areas and whether there are any other big categories which kind of lend themselves to the same thing. And on managed payment, how was that, I think you guys talked about it tracking to your own expectations. But just considering the fact that it seems that you guys have a fair amount of control over that. Is there a chance of seeing you migrate maybe the majority of all sellers globally earlier than expected. And if not, what are the, gating factors there. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so the change in selling fees on sneakers we had done a while ago, and what I would say is that, it's very early and that we just launched that a few weeks ago. But the encouraging signs or what the feedback that we're getting from the community really leaning in and being excited by what it can do to unlock the categories. Watches has been live a little bit longer. And while early, what we're seeing is an increase in supply on the platform and an increase in average selling price. And if you think about it. That's really what we want to see is that higher level of trust is making buyers really more comfortable which obviously works out for sellers as well. You know what I'm really proud of, for the team is that when we talk about a tech-led re-imagination. Well, it took us a couple of months to launch that technology for watches. We actually rolled it out a few weeks later for sneakers. And so we're building capabilities that allow us to compete better in specific vertical, but a lot of those capabilities can be leveraged across multiple categories and that excites us. On the managed payments migration. It's important to know that there is still features that we continue to build out to be able to migrate more of a seller. So, we're right on track. But as an example, if I'm a seller that ships cross border to a country that we haven't launched managed payments and we're not going to convert that seller over to the new managed payments platform until we are marked by country, because we don't want them split between the old platform and the new platform. So, there is still capabilities that we are continuing to build out to ramp, and we basically are on track with our plan to be complete by the end of 2021.\nYoussef Squali: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess just to drill down on some of these new categories little bit more, I know you're using third-party authentication, but can you kind of help us understand the cost profile around that, whether they have the ability to scale, as the business grows. And then I guess, just stepping back, the three big announcement that refurbish watches and sneakers. I guess what are the three, do you think would be most significant or impactful in the medium term? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So, when we look at the authentication costs, we look at it, in some ways it's like a marketing costs. When we think about how do we bring new buyers into the platform. So, if you look at what we, what we would have collected and final value fees for example on that product versus our cost of acquisition of bringing in a new buyer for, it's going to end up buying in 10 unique categories across the site. We're balancing that all out, and we think it's -- we think it's important, we think there is a lot of potential and we think it's a, it's a big difference for eBay to have that level of trust in the category. We haven't talked much about certified refurbish on the call yet. But I'm really excited by that. I mean sneakers clearly has a lot of potential as those watches, but there is tens of billions of dollars in certified refurbish. It's a real sweet spot for eBay. And this brings a whole new level of trust of feeling like you're buying unlike new product because you have the, not only all those guarantees, but you have a two-year warranty, you have a 30 day hassle free return along with the eBay money back guarantee. So, we just think it's an important category. We're also seeing brands lean in like we talked about on the call and big brands and we're just getting started. So we think there is a lot of runway and a huge market opportunity for us to go after that.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nRobert Drbul: Hey, good evening. I just got a couple of questions, mainly on M&A, in terms of like you have some -- the cash on the balance sheet, you talked a little bit about that, but I was just wondering, as you sort of look at, especially the sneaker category, would you consider acquisitions around that category to really accelerate your positioning and improve it? Maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on that type of charge that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, we're not going to -- we're not going to speculate on kind of specific categories and M&A, what I'd say is we're looking opportunistically at M&A, like we always have at opportunities where we think we could accelerate the vision that we laid out on the prior earnings calls and always doing things at an asset light way and like we tend to do here at eBay, in a way that we think enhances shareholder value. So we're going to continue to be opportunistic about it.\nRobert Drbul: Great. And if I could just follow up on a different topic, but in terms of the ability to sort of grow the buyers and sellers, can you just talk a little more about like the fourth quarter marketing plans and advertising in terms of the focus on continuing to bring new buyers and sellers in -- and the level of the rate at which you're thinking about that.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, we're using some new tools and technology over the holiday, really going after some new channels like paid social like I talked about before. In addition to the other kind of brand and performance work that we normally do in the holidays. But really we're also you're also going to see more targeted marketing from us and you're seeing it already, where we're focusing on specific campaigns, like we had a viral campaign on tick-tock for sneakers that went incredibly viral and you'll see other specific, early vertical marketing that we're doing to attract the right types of buyers in these categories that were leaning in on. So lots of things that we've experimented with that we're learning from that, that we're rolling out in the quarter.\nRobert Drbul: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thanks for taking my questions. I've two -- just the first one, I think in the second quarter you added a -- I think it's about $8 million net buyers sequentially. I know a lot of focus is on turning them into broader shoppers and sellers. Can you talk to us about what you saw in the retention of those buyers that you added in the second quarter? Are you seeing that expansion into new categories of them already? And then, Jamie, just now that you had a few more months in the seat, maybe just talk to us about how you are categorizing low hanging -- low hanging fruit areas of improvement that could really change the business trajectory in 2021 as opposed to sort of your longer term areas of focus.\nJamie Iannone: Sure. So, let me start with the latter, and then we'll come back on the buyer one. So if you look at the types of things that we rolled out this quarter, it's indicative of where our focus areas are. So, when you think about defend the core, it's really around how do we go after the non-new season and help grow that business? We see a big kind of $500 billion TAM there. And like I talked about last quarter, this is -- these are not big bang releases you I think what our payments business as a two-year build for release. Here, I think what we're working on is a lot of releases throughout the year of different capabilities and hopefully continue like I talked about before of launching something and then being able to roll it out to other categories other countries, et cetera. On a pretty frequent basis. And that's how we're thinking about it is a multi-year journey with a lot of wins along the way. Andy, you want to take the buyer one?\nAndy Cring: Yes, Brian, look what we saw in the second quarter, clearly a significant disruption in a lot of areas and scarcity in certain areas in the supply chain and distribution that drove a lot of people shopping online and we did see some incremental activity from that, from the cohort acquired at the end of the first and in the beginning of the second. What we've seen in the third is it's reverting to a more normalized buyer acquisition trend and more normalized repurchase frequency for those cohorts. So, not performing above all cohorts and certainly not performing any worse than buyers in the past, what we have seen consistent across both quarters is just the volume of GMV and the amount of GMV per buyer, both for existing buyers and new buyers at higher levels than we've seen in the past.\nBrian Nowak: Got it. Okay. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no -- there is no more time for questions. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andy Cring",
            "content": "Thanks Jamie and thank you all for joining today. Before I walk you through the results for the quarter, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some additional context on the financial reporting impact of moving our Classifieds business to discontinued operations. With that designation, our reported results reflect only the performance of our marketplace business. The Q3 results for Classifieds are reflected in GAAP EPS from discontinued operations. You can find the presentation of historical financial statements, recap to the current presentation in the Form 8-K we published on October 1st. When we last provided guidance in July, Classifieds was included in both our Q3 and full year 2020 guidance assumptions. On slide four, you will see a refreshed look at what our July guidance would have been if we had excluded Classifieds. This will help create an apples-to-apples comparison versus our Q3 results reported today. Let me quickly walk -- let me quickly walk you through the numbers. Adjusting for the Classifieds impact to our July guidance, the implied Q3 guide for marketplaces was between $2.38 billion and $2.45 billion of revenue growing 16% to 19% on an organic FX-neutral basis, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.68 and $0.74 per share, representing 31% to 42% growth. On slide five, we've made a similar adjustment for our full year guide. Adjusting for Classifieds, the implied full year 2020 guide for marketplaces revenue was between $9.59 billion and $9.78 billion, growing 14% to 16% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Operating margin in the range of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP EPS between $3.04 and $3.16 per share, and GAAP EPS between $2.51 and $2.66 per share. And finally, free cash flow adjust to the range of $2.2 billion to $2.35 billion. With that, I will move on to our current quarter results. Turning to our Q3 highlights on slide six. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, up 26% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.85, up 64%. Both were significantly above our expectations. Non-GAAP margin came in strong at 30.7%, inclusive of our ongoing investment in managed payments. We generated $584 million of free cash flow. We executed $700 million of share repurchases, and delivered $111 million in cash dividends in the quarter. Our Q3 over-performance was driven by a number of factors including our migration to managed payments, strong execution in advertising and volume growth ahead of our expectations. Based on our Q3 results and an improved topline outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year guidance, which I will cover in more detail in the guidance section. Moving to active buyers on slide seven, we ended the third quarter with 183 million active buyers representing 5% year-on-year growth, consistent with the second quarter. New and reactivated buyers continue to drive year-on-year growth. We continue to see strength in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts in Q3. While we initially saw stronger activity levels from buyers acquired in Q1 and Q2, those buyers are now trending toward behavior more consistent with historical cohorts. Moving to slide eight, in Q3, we enabled $25 billion of marketplace GMV, up 21% year-on-year, decelerating eight points versus the prior quarter as global mobility continue to improve, particularly in our international on-platform markets. In the U.S., we generated $9.8 billion of GMV, up 33% year-on-year, decelerating two points from the second quarter. Growth was at its peak in July and then moderated through August and September driven in part by the wind down of government stimulus payments even as residential mobility remained relatively constant. International GMV was up 14% year-on-year, a 12 point deceleration versus the second quarter driven by moderation in Germany and the U.K. We saw strong ongoing correlation between mobility restrictions and GMV growth across our international markets, where the most pronounced growth deceleration occurred in markets with the biggest increases in mobility. In our off-platform Korean business, growth was 4%, decelerating one point from the second quarter. Looking closer at volume, we continue to assess the impact of COVID to better understand the overall performance of our business. We have seen modestly improved underlying performance versus our pre-COVID 2020 plan driven by increased velocity and product experience improvements and ongoing tailwind from the recent increases in our active buyer base. In addition, we've seen temporary COVID-related growth acceleration in GMV that we expect will continue to moderate as mobility increases over time. And with this component being the biggest wild card in terms of magnitude and timing, it remains difficult to predict results beyond the near-term. Turning to revenue on slide nine, our net revenue was $2.6 billion, up 26% organically, decelerating two points. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, up 28% down five points from the second quarter with strength in payments and advertising partially offsetting the deceleration in GMV. Looking closer at managed payments, the increased seller adoption and high customer satisfaction that Jamie mentioned that's five points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019 on a continuing operations basis. Approximately one point better than anticipated. Transaction take rate was 9.4% for the quarter, accelerating nearly 40 basis points from Q2, primarily from the ramp of managed payments and the continued strength in promoted listings. We expect take rate to continue to increase further as managed payments and promoted listings continue to scale. We delivered $251 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 1% accelerating 15 points from the second quarter, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of best for friends in the middle of Q3 2019 and our first-party growth in Korea. Turning to slide 10 and major cost drivers as a percentage of revenue. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30.7%. This is approximately 4 points higher year-on-year, driven by volume leverage, partially offset by continuing investments in managed payments and strategic reinvestments. Cost of revenue was down nearly 20 basis points year-on-year as volume leverage is partially offset by managed payments and are expanding first-party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over two points versus the prior year as volume leverage was partially offset by strategic reinvestments in online marketing brand and our vertical strategy. Product development costs were down approximately 10 basis points, driven by volume leverage, partially offset by incremental investments in the product experience including managed payments. G&A was down nearly 40 basis points, primarily from leverage and cost control. Transaction losses were down one point as bad debt rates have performed better than expected. Turning to EPS on slide 11, in Q3, we delivered $0.85 of non-GAAP EPS, up 64% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher revenue growth and our share repurchase program, partially offset by our investment in managed payments and FX. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.88, up 250% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the change in fair value of the Adyen warrant and the same factors as non-GAAP performance, in addition to lapping the divestiture of brands for friends. The value of the Adyen warrant stands at $777 million at the end of Q3, an increase of $573 million year-over-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant and our 10-Q, and as always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to slide 12, we generated $584 million of free cash flow in Q3 down 18% driven by the timing of cash taxes, partially offset by higher earnings. Year-to-date through the third quarter, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion up nearly 30% year-on-year. Moving to slide 13, we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and investments, and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q3, we paid down over $900 million in debt, bringing our total debt, back to the 2019 year-end balance of $7.8 billion. This completes actions taken in 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt. Additionally, we paid over $700 million in income taxes from the divestiture of StubHub which is presented in operating cash flow from discontinued operations, leaving approximately $250 million to pay in Q4. We returned $111 million to shareholders and dividends in the quarter. We executed $700 million in share buybacks in Q3, bringing our total share buyback to $4.7 billion so far this year. We entered Q4 with $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization remaining. Our capital allocation strategy and key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our BBB plus credit rating, mid-term leverage of approximately one and a half times net debt and gross debt below three times EBITDA, and a target cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Moving to slide 14, I'd like to provide an update on the pending Classifieds transaction. We remain excited about this deal as it allows us to realize near-term value while enabling us to participate in the future upside potential of the world's largest online classifieds company. We are on track to close the deal in Q1 subject to regulatory approvals. When we announced the deal on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and net of shares. The share price has appreciated by over 30% which increases the value of the Classifieds business to over $11 billion based on recent trading levels. Finally, we expect that the cash portion of the deal will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any potential future sale of shares would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate. Turning to slide 15, in guidance. We continue to operate in an environment with low visibility which proves to be very difficult when trying to provide guidance. Each month, sometimes each week reveals new external drivers that can have a material impact on consumer behavior. The dynamics we faced in Q3 were different from what we've faced in Q2 and it's clear that Q4 will be different than what we experienced in Q3. The shape and speed of pandemic recovery, the strength of the holiday season and the size and timing of potential government stimulus programs are among the many variables that could have a significant impact on our outlook. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.71 billion, growing 19% to 22% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace volume growth at low double-digit rates with gradual moderation through the quarter. We expect managed payments to continue to deliver revenue acceleration contributing approximately eight points to Q4 revenue at the midpoint of our guide, driven by continued seller migration. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 to $0.84 per share, representing 18% to 27% growth. Non-GAAP EPS growth is driven primarily by volume and lower share count partially offset by continuing investments in technology and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share in Q4. After adjusting for Classifieds moved to discontinued operations, this Q4 guide represents a material improvement on volume, revenue, and non-GAAP EPS versus our expectations back in July. For the full year, our revenue guidance is $10.04 billion to $10.11 billion, representing an organic FX-neutral growth rate of 19% to 20%, driven by an improved GMV outlook and continued scaling of managed payments and advertising. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.5% with the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15% to 16%. With the above dynamics, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.34 to $3.40 per share driven by Q3 over performance and an improved topline outlook for the fourth quarter. We now expect free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, capex in the range of 4% to 5% of revenue, and we are increasing our outlook on share repurchases to approximately $5 billion for the full year. Finally, we expect GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3 to $3.06 per share. In closing, we are excited about the progress we've made this quarter. Externally, the macro environment is helping to drive strong business performance. Internally, with the leadership team now solely focused on the marketplaces business, we're making progress with our new strategy. We're pleased by the increase in speed of execution demonstrated by our launching authenticity guarantee across multiple categories, rolling out our certified refurbish program, expanding shipping services, and tracking and helping buyers find items in faster and simpler ways. We're doing all of this while delivering on our revenue growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising which are both becoming critical material pieces of our financial architecture. Our margin commitments remain in place and we're on track to deliver at least two points of operating margin growth by 2022 as compared with 2019. As we've said in the past, we will continue to balance topline growth and margin expansion as we find new opportunities we will capitalize on them to drive growth. We remain focused on improving the underlying health of the marketplaces business. And as we've mentioned, this is going to be a multi-year journey. Although it's early, the results tell us, we're on the right track furthering our conviction to compete and win in the $0.5 trillion total addressable market we're focused on. And now, Jamie and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator? I'll start with the question on guide and Scott, to your point, there is new information coming out on a daily basis, which makes this tough. I think the way that we've looked at it, clearly, there is multiple factors moving that can influence our volume outlook for the quarter. It's really hard to predict how any of them will play out and certainly to try to itemize which pieces we've included for which amount. We can't do at this point. What we have tried to do with our guide is compile what we've learned through the third quarter and what we've seen. And it implies a continued growth moderation in the fourth quarter following what we saw in the third, and what we're seeing the beginning of the fourth with regards to consumer behavior and mobility. What we provided, I wouldn't call it conservative, I think it's our best outlook based on the combination of these factors, and certainly any one of those could change and could impact our results. On the -- I think you called it right on the sold items, there's GMV and category mix and similar to what you see on buyers and what you see on GMV there's just a magnitude of things changing on a quarter-over-quarter basis given the breadth of categories that we have in the different price tranches. I think you called it, right. Yes, I'll take the -- on the third quarter volume, U.S. international, look; there are differences we see globally. We indicated on our -- on the call in July that we were seeing continued strength through the month of July in the U.S. Post-July, we did see some increased moderation in August and September. And we think at least in part driven by the expiration of the US stimulus. So that, in part, I think is a little bit of strength you're seeing in the U.S. In addition to, if you look at mobility and the progress of COVID, internationally there was a little more mobility sooner, in particularly in Germany and the U.K. than we had in the U.S. So, I don't think there is a drastic business shift between any of those regions other than some of the dynamics associated with the reopening. I think another important, you have just generally on volume. We have there's a few things we do see that consumer behavior patterns are definitely impacted by mobility that is different depending on location and country and sometimes state. And I think the other, the other key thing is that the customer and consumer behavior patterns aren't the same, so as mobility and lockdown happened in April and May, we had more time and less scarcity, some of that behavior is not as drastic as you -- as we saw early on in the pandemic. And then on the second part of the question, was managed payments. Yeah, your logic is about right on that. Yes, Brian, look what we saw in the second quarter, clearly a significant disruption in a lot of areas and scarcity in certain areas in the supply chain and distribution that drove a lot of people shopping online and we did see some incremental activity from that, from the cohort acquired at the end of the first and in the beginning of the second. What we've seen in the third is it's reverting to a more normalized buyer acquisition trend and more normalized repurchase frequency for those cohorts. So, not performing above all cohorts and certainly not performing any worse than buyers in the past, what we have seen consistent across both quarters is just the volume of GMV and the amount of GMV per buyer, both for existing buyers and new buyers at higher levels than we've seen in the past."

            "content": "Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today I'll walk you through some of the key highlights from the quarter and update you [technical difficulty] of the company. Then I will turn the call over to Andy to discuss our recent performance and near-term outlook. Before I do that, I'd like to take a moment and reflect on a major milestone eBay passed last month. 25 years ago during Labor Day Weekend, our Founder Pierre launched eBay as a technology experiment. The aspiration was to create an open, fair, and trusted marketplace that empowered people and created [ph] economic opportunities for all. Since our inception, eBay pioneered online shopping, has become an iconic brand that has shaped the modern e-commerce landscape. We are very proud of our accomplishments and today we connect over 183 million buyers to nearly 90 million sellers around the world in a broad and diverse set of categories. We are operating during historic times when our buyers and sellers need us most, while supporting our employees who are working hard to meet the needs of our customers and adjusting [ph] to their own reality. As we look ahead to the next 25 years, our business become the best global marketplace to buy and sell goods through our tech lead re-imagination [technical difficulty]. I will come back to this in a moment, but first let me talk about our most recent achievements. In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Earlier this month, we updated how we report classified [ph], but to be clear on apples-to-apples basis, we performed better than expectations on both the top and bottom-lines. Gross merchandise volume and marketplace 21%. To put that in perspective, we added over 4 billion in volume in Q3 versus last year, more than many businesses do annually. Active buyers increased over 183 million globally, organic revenue grew faster than volume, up 26% driven by payments and advertising. Migration made significant progress in Q3 and is giving [ph] buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-end experience. Starting with five of our largest markets, we focused first on transitioning business sellers to the payments form. As a result, we ended the quarter with over 340,000 sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 20% of on platform volume. Additionally, we informed sellers that we are expanding manage payments to France, Italy, and Spain in early 2021. And we will begin to migrate consumer sellers in Q4 in the U.S. We remain on track and expecting the vast majority of our transition by the end of next year. So, our feedback has been encouraging as NPS from sellers [technical difficulty] payments has averaged more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Buyers love the flexibility, choice, and ease of use. We're seeing new and reactivated buyers, ultimate forms of payment, like credit and debit cards, Google pay and Apple Pay across the majority of their purchases. We were confident that we are on pace to deliver $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in income [technical difficulty] basis by 2022. Advertising growth continues to be driven by promoted listings, which continue to outpace volumes, a trend we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. In the third quarter, promoted listings delivered $186 million of revenue, up 77%. We are providing sellers with more data-driven recommendations to optimize their ad conversion, while we test and build more technology features to drive future growth and position eBay [technical difficulty]. Now turning to Classifieds. We believe that the transfer of Classifieds [technical difficulty] is on track to be completed in Q1 2021 subject to regulatory approvals. We're excited to bring together the two highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. The market agrees as evidenced by the appreciation of Adevinta share price, which increased in value of eBay from $9.2 billion to over $11 billion based on recent trading levels. As you may recall, last quarter, I outlined a long-term vision for eBay. Through a tech-lead re-imagination, we realize the enormous untapped potential of our marketplace and drive sustainable long-term growth. We have three strategic priorities to support this vision. First, to defend our core by better compelling next gen experiences for RCVs. Second, to become the partner of choice for sellers, and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. We are in the first phase of multiyear journey that many improvements for buyers and sellers yet to come. But over the past quarter, we were able to take several steps towards realizing this vision decision. As I mentioned, our first priority is all about defending our core business. Our focus here is on non-newest using products and simplifying consumer selling. We're taking a holistic view of customer needs, responding and launching features to address those needs, and rapidly changing the approach leveraging scalable technology across [technical difficulty] categories. A great example of that is the series of changes we made to our luxury watch category. Recently, we launched authenticity guarantee on all watches above $2,000. [ph]. This increases confidence both buyers and sellers. Buyers can do a meticulous verification by third-party experts and sellers are protected from [technical difficulty] returns. In addition, we announced an [technical difficulty] for high-dollar transactions plus new app content for watch enthusiast and we also reduce fees for sellers. While this service is still in its early stages, we starting to see a modest increase in supply and higher average selling prices. We've also turned our focus to the sneakers category, which attracts passionate enthusiast, particularly GenZ and Millennials. In the US, sneaker GMV has significantly improved from a year ago. These buyers and sellers bring tremendous value to our ecosystem. An average sneaker buyer purchases in 10 unique categories each year more than double the amount of other eBay buyers. Leveraging similar technology launched in watches, we expanded the authenticity guarantee to sneakers. We're requiring all collectible sneakers both new and pre-owned above $100 to be verified by a team of independent third-party industry experts. The program kicked off with the authentication of our most popular brands and styles and will scale that all sneakers sales over $100 next year. A year ago, we were losing share in this important category. But now we're seeing over 50% [technical difficulty] growth year-to-date and that was before launching the authenticity guarantee. And just last week, we announced the launch of new elevated experience for certified refurbished product. We see tens of billions of dollars in untapped potential in the global refurbished market. Through our new certified refurbished program, buyers can save up to 50% unlike new branded inventory with all the assurances of buying new including a two-year warranty, eBay money back guarantee, and hassle free 30 day returns. We are launching this program in partnership with globally recognized brands, including [technical difficulty] and Fila, that was all certified refurbished inventory exclusively on eBay, not only does this program help with buyers budgets leading into the holiday season, it also helps to eliminate unnecessary waste by keeping products in circulation for many years to come. We see a long runway to accelerate GMV growth given the $500 billion global total addressable market, we are competing for, but it will take time. By leveraging scalable technology, we can uniquely address the needs of customers across a diverse mix of categories in electronics, fashion, collectibles, home and garden, parts and accessories, and more. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. Over the past three months, in addition to enhancements in managed payments and advertising, we continue to leverage the scale of eBay to benefit small businesses. We worked closely with UPS to offer new shipping services for sellers on our platform. In addition to a direct integration with eBay labels, sellers now have access to discounted rates saving them time and money. Sellers also have access to order details, customer information, label printing and shipment tracking all in one place and buyers benefit from lower shipping costs and integrated tracking. Additionally, we are supporting seller profitability during the upcoming holiday season by working with the carriers on our platform to eliminate peak season shipping surcharges on eBay. Recently, we rolled out-- Hi, in the midst of repeating myself, I'm going to go back a little bit just to make sure, because I understand the line got fuzzy which we apologize about the technical difficulties. So, we also turned our focus to the sneakers category, which attracts passionate enthusiast, particularly GenZ and Millennials. In the U.S., sneaker GMV has significantly improved from a year ago. These buyers and sellers bring tremendous value to our ecosystem. An average sneaker buyer purchases in 10 unique categories each year more than double the amount of other eBay buyers. Leveraging similar technology launched in watches, we expanded the authenticity guarantee to sneakers. We required all collectible sneakers both new and pre-owned above $100 to be verified by a team of independent third-party industry experts. The program kicked off with the authentication of our most popular brands and styles and will scale that all sneakers sales over $100 next year. A year ago we were losing share in this important category. But now we're seeing over 50% GMV growth year-to-date and that was before launching the authenticity guarantee. And just last week, we announced the launch of new elevated experience for certified refurbished product. We see tens of billions of dollars in untapped potential in the global refurbished market.  Through our new certified refurbished program, buyers can save up to 50% unlike new branded inventory with all the assurances of buying new including a two-year warranty, eBay money back guarantee, and hassle free 30 day returns. We are launching this program in partnership with globally recognized brands, including De'Longhi, Dirt Devil, Hoover, Nikita, and Fila, that was all certified refurbished inventory exclusively on eBay, not only does this program help with buyers budgets leading into the holiday season, it also helps to eliminate unnecessary waste by keeping products in circulation for many years to come. We see a long runway to accelerate GMV growth given the $500 billion global TAM, we are competing for, but it will take time. By leveraging scalable technology we can uniquely address the needs of customers across a diverse mix of categories in electronics, fashion, collectibles, home and garden, parts and accessories, and more. Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. Over the past three months, in addition to enhancements in managed payments and advertising, we continue to leverage the scale of eBay to benefit small businesses. We worked closely with UPS to offer new shipping services for sellers on our platform. In addition to a direct integration with eBay label, sellers now have access to discounted rates saving them time and money. Sellers also have access to order details, customer information, label printing and shipment tracking all in one place. And buyers benefit from lower shipping costs and integrated tracking. Additionally, we are supporting seller profitability during the upcoming holiday season by working with the carriers on our platform to eliminate peak season shipping surcharges on eBay. Recently, we rolled out an upgraded communication system that allows buyers and sellers to connect securely on our platform. Also, we have provided small businesses, a new marketing tool to drive traffic back to their eBay stores through our affiliate platform. And just in time for the holidays, last month, we expanded the time away functionality, making it easier for sellers to update their listings and protect their on-time delivery record while providing buyers more accurate shipping estimates. Looking forward, we are embarking on a multi-quarter journey to improve selling flows that leverage more AI capabilities to dramatically simplify selling and drive more growth for small businesses. The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationship with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. In Q3, we improved search results, which would lead to material increases in conversion by including more behavioral data, we were able to optimize machine learning algorithms at the top of the funnel that led to improved buyer engagement and ultimately, led to increased purchases. These technology advances generate significant impact, as every incremental point of conversion creates almost $1 billion more GMV annually. More importantly, buyers are discovering the items they are searching for in faster and simpler way. Another way we are building trusted relationships with buyers is by improving our shipping tracking. In the U.K. and Australia, we developed a unique new capability to implement virtual tracking for Royal Mail and Australia Post leading to significant increases in tracking coverage. Sellers do not have to explicitly provide information and buyers can track orders with confidence. We will continue to invest in the buyer experience and marketing technology capabilities as we work to foster lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. Finally, an area that I and the team are extremely passionate about is doing good for our communities around the world. We focused initiatives on the sustainability issues material for the long-term strength of our business. And where we can be most impactful to our stakeholders. We have measurable and transparent goals to alert, evaluate our progress and to hold ourselves accountable to these important milestones. Such as driving more circular commerce getting to 100% renewable energy by 2025 and raising significant amounts for charitable causes. We began eBay for Charity in 2003 to make it easier for customers to support their favorite charities, since then we've raised over $1 billion for charities around the world. And we're working hard on our goal of another $600 million raised by 2025. In Q3, eBay for Charity began working alongside international artists through a campaign called Artists Band Together. We are helping to raise funds for organizations that work to increase voter turnout for the upcoming U.S. elections. Additionally, eBay Foundation reached its $1 million Kiva lending goal to support global untapped entrepreneurs through an employee micro-lending initiatives. At eBay, everything we do ties back to our purpose of creating economic opportunity for all and I'm very proud of our team for keeping this in the forefront especially during these remarkable times. So, in summary, we have a clear vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, while we have made meaningful progress in Q3, we still have a long way to go. We are investing in technology and focused on delivering the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. And I want to thank all of our employees who have been working diligently to support our customers by bringing our tech led re-imagination to life. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy? Yes, so on the first one on the tech-led re-imagination, it's why you see us making the investments that we're making is that, we believe that there is some big horizontal things that really move the business like payments and advertising. We're obviously putting a lot of technology focus. And then you saw this quarter, some specific vertical experiences of focus for us in both watches and sneakers and also in certified refurbish. And so we actually think this is the start of really leveraging our technology, we are horizontal plus vertical focus brings together just a much different experience on eBay. You think about the level of trust that we just put in place in those three categories. So, it's really game-changing versus where we were before. You asked specifically about marketing, there is a lot of things that we're dealing specifically in, paid social and using new channels that we haven't used before. That's a key part of it for us. If you think about the sneaker category, as an example, we're bringing on a lot of GenZ and Millennials. So, we're going out, reaching them where they are. Because when we enquire them in the sneaker category as we said, they end up buying in 10 unique categories across the site. The second thing I'd say on our footprint is, look, we've got some very strong growth in some of our smaller markets. There is a lot of advantage to the scale of our cross-border trade business where we're bringing products from very different countries to our smaller countries or exporting out of our smaller countries and obviously play a role in that. So, we continue to believe that those are important good growth opportunities, not only for the domestic business, but also for the cross-border trade that they bring. Yes, so on carrier capacity, part of why we did the UPS deal this year was to open up more flexibility and more options for our sellers. So not only are they going to save a bunch on the rate that they're going to have on there, but the integration is going to make it really easy for sellers and provide all that tracking for buyers. So, now you have multiple options even as a small consumer seller between USPS UPS and FedEx, one of the things we have worked on is deals that actually protect them from peak shipping charges or surcharges over the holiday. So, we think the combination of that flexibility of choices, plus the negotiating on behalf of our community, we'll work out well for them on the shipping side. On the active buyer growth as we talked about, our real third priority is turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts. So really focusing on how do we, when we bring in a new buyer expand them into multiple categories, because we know that drives their LTV, so I use the sneakers example earlier coming in via sneakers and they are buying in 10 categories. It's also a big vision for our push-to-consumer selling. This quarter, I actually see the fee GMV growth grew faster than our B2C growth. And that push is really because once we get to a buyer to sell, they become more than twice as valuable as a buyer, so that's really our focus is on accelerating those things and driving that long-term potential of the people that we're bringing to the site. Yes, so on the first one -- thank you for the question. We work with really industry leading experts to do the authentication specific for that category and a very intense multipoint inspection to make sure, the product is truly authentic. And so it really kind of not only you have to trust it kind of seller piece in there, but every single product, every single sneakers over $100 by the start of next year, will actually go through a third party authenticator. And so really takes the risk away of a potential issue by the time it gets to the buyer, even sometimes there could be a mistake, it was missing a piece of documentation. So, the beauty is, we're catching all of those things. The same thing in the returns. On making sure, and the seller is getting back the product that they actually ship the buyer, because the authentication works in both directions. So, look, it's a really high level of trust, when you look at the community feedback that we've got, and both from sellers and buyers, they're incredibly enthusiastic. They know it will bring a lot of new buyers to the platform, and for sellers, that's what they want. Like we said on the call, the business was growing 50% in sneakers even before we launched this authentication guarantees. So, we're excited by it. On the C2C ramp, it's a huge focus for us, it's using artificial intelligence and technologies to make it easier for the casual lister to come on and list. So, a lot of our listers will use things like sell similar, whether sell a similar product or they sell based on a specific catalog description. And what you'll see from us over the coming quarters is continuing to make that process easier to bring more to C2C sellers on. It's our, number 1 priority is defending the core and a huge part of that is consumer-selling. I should say that they also bring a unique inventory to the platform. There is a lot of things that are not being sold by a business seller. My -- one of my friends was looking for a guitar, [Indiscernible] hero and that's always, no one selling that B2C anymore, you're only going to get that from a C2C seller. So, we'd like to think about the unique inventory that it brings to the platform is also really important to us. Yes, so the change in selling fees on sneakers we had done a while ago, and what I would say is that, it's very early and that we just launched that a few weeks ago. But the encouraging signs or what the feedback that we're getting from the community really leaning in and being excited by what it can do to unlock the categories. Watches has been live a little bit longer. And while early, what we're seeing is an increase in supply on the platform and an increase in average selling price. And if you think about it. That's really what we want to see is that higher level of trust is making buyers really more comfortable which obviously works out for sellers as well. You know what I'm really proud of, for the team is that when we talk about a tech-led re-imagination. Well, it took us a couple of months to launch that technology for watches. We actually rolled it out a few weeks later for sneakers. And so we're building capabilities that allow us to compete better in specific vertical, but a lot of those capabilities can be leveraged across multiple categories and that excites us. On the managed payments migration. It's important to know that there is still features that we continue to build out to be able to migrate more of a seller. So, we're right on track. But as an example, if I'm a seller that ships cross border to a country that we haven't launched managed payments and we're not going to convert that seller over to the new managed payments platform until we are marked by country, because we don't want them split between the old platform and the new platform. So, there is still capabilities that we are continuing to build out to ramp, and we basically are on track with our plan to be complete by the end of 2021. Yes. So, when we look at the authentication costs, we look at it, in some ways it's like a marketing costs. When we think about how do we bring new buyers into the platform. So, if you look at what we, what we would have collected and final value fees for example on that product versus our cost of acquisition of bringing in a new buyer for, it's going to end up buying in 10 unique categories across the site. We're balancing that all out, and we think it's -- we think it's important, we think there is a lot of potential and we think it's a, it's a big difference for eBay to have that level of trust in the category. We haven't talked much about certified refurbish on the call yet. But I'm really excited by that. I mean sneakers clearly has a lot of potential as those watches, but there is tens of billions of dollars in certified refurbish. It's a real sweet spot for eBay. And this brings a whole new level of trust of feeling like you're buying unlike new product because you have the, not only all those guarantees, but you have a two-year warranty, you have a 30 day hassle free return along with the eBay money back guarantee. So, we just think it's an important category. We're also seeing brands lean in like we talked about on the call and big brands and we're just getting started. So we think there is a lot of runway and a huge market opportunity for us to go after that. Yes, we're not going to -- we're not going to speculate on kind of specific categories and M&A, what I'd say is we're looking opportunistically at M&A, like we always have at opportunities where we think we could accelerate the vision that we laid out on the prior earnings calls and always doing things at an asset light way and like we tend to do here at eBay, in a way that we think enhances shareholder value. So we're going to continue to be opportunistic about it. Yes, we're using some new tools and technology over the holiday, really going after some new channels like paid social like I talked about before. In addition to the other kind of brand and performance work that we normally do in the holidays. But really we're also you're also going to see more targeted marketing from us and you're seeing it already, where we're focusing on specific campaigns, like we had a viral campaign on tick-tock for sneakers that went incredibly viral and you'll see other specific, early vertical marketing that we're doing to attract the right types of buyers in these categories that were leaning in on. So lots of things that we've experimented with that we're learning from that, that we're rolling out in the quarter. Sure. So, let me start with the latter, and then we'll come back on the buyer one. So if you look at the types of things that we rolled out this quarter, it's indicative of where our focus areas are. So, when you think about defend the core, it's really around how do we go after the non-new season and help grow that business? We see a big kind of $500 billion TAM there. And like I talked about last quarter, this is -- these are not big bang releases you I think what our payments business as a two-year build for release. Here, I think what we're working on is a lot of releases throughout the year of different capabilities and hopefully continue like I talked about before of launching something and then being able to roll it out to other categories other countries, et cetera. On a pretty frequent basis. And that's how we're thinking about it is a multi-year journey with a lot of wins along the way. Andy, you want to take the buyer one?"

With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Andy to discuss our recent performance and near-term outlook, I'll take some time to share thought on my return to eBay, highlight a few observations from the quarter and share our vision for the company. I'm thrilled to be speaking with all of you today as CEO of eBay. I've long admired this unique company for its special culture and its enormous potential.  I spent my first 100 days primarily focused on three areas, immersing myself in the business, connecting with our buyers and our sellers throughout the world and meeting different teams across the organization. Throughout these engagements, I've been fortunate to observe, firsthand, the significant opportunity we have ahead of us.  Our purpose has always been to empower people and create economic opportunity for all, and there's never been a better time where this has mattered more than right now.  We're a globally recognized brand with a strong heritage, incredible assets and a talented and dedicated team who serve our passionate and loyal customer community. As we look into the future, we have a clear vision to build on these strengths and through a technology led reimagination of eBay, we'll become the best global marketplace to buy and sell.  Before I get into our vision for the future, I want to frame where we are in the context of today's market. Consumer behavior is rapidly evolving, and this dynamic has been accelerated by COVID-19, contributing to a significant volume acceleration and new customer acquisition. This led to a very strong quarter, coming in ahead of the recently increased expectations we shared in early June. Volume was strong across most major markets in the Marketplaces business, growing 29%, our highest quarterly growth rate in 15 years. We also added approximately 8 million more buyers to bring the annual active buyer base to 182 million. On behalf of our buyers, I want to thank our sellers for doing an amazing job selling and shipping over the past few months. Organic revenue was up 22% with strong Marketplaces volume offsetting an anticipated decline in Classifieds. Total margin rate was up five points to 34% and earnings per share was $1.08.  The current strength in demand creates a significant opportunity for us as we embark on the next phase, while also providing additional capacity for investment, which we're moving with pace to implement. In Q2, we were able to deploy incremental investments in the marketing and growth initiatives, while still delivering higher margins.  Operationally, our top initiative over the past two years, Managed Payments, just reached a very important milestone as we begin to scale globally. Although the original operating agreement reached the end of its term, PayPal will remain an important partner moving forward as a payment option for buyers. And from a seller perspective, after successful launches in the US and Germany over the past two years, we've started migrating sellers in the UK, Australia and Canada on payments. We expect to transition the majority of all sellers globally over the next 18 months and we remain on track to realize $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating profit in 2022. Managed payments is a great example of a tech-led reimagination of our marketplace. It provides a simpler and seamless experience for buyers and sellers around the world. Buyers can pay with ease and convenience with more choices of popular local payment methods. And, sellers benefit from a streamlined experience, more options on how and when to be paid, and the vast majority of sellers are saving money on fees. We've also recently concluded our portfolio review, leading to the pending transfer of the Classifieds business to Adevinta for approximately $9.2 billion. We are excited to bring together two highly complementary businesses in order to create the world's largest online classifieds group, with leading positions in 20 countries, covering 1 billion people around the world. With a strong partner in Adevinta, this structure allows us to dedicate our day-to-day focus on Marketplaces, provides immediate value for shareholders, and allows us to participate in the future growth of classifieds.  Against this encouraging backdrop, I'd like to share our long-term vision for eBay.  Put simply, our vision is to build on the company's powerful strengths to become the best global marketplace for buyers and sellers through a tech-led re-imagination of eBay. We've come a long way in our nearly 25 years, growing from our founder's first sale of a broken laser pointer into a global platform with more than 180 million buyers and tens of millions of sellers worldwide exchanging over $85 billion of goods. While there are many accomplishments to be proud of, we are not satisfied with where we currently stand. The reality is that in the past few years, we've not executed to our full potential. New competitors have taken share because we neglected our core area of expertise. We focused on new areas that did not drive sustainable or profitable growth. And, to be candid, we did not adapt quickly enough to the rapidly changing needs of our customers. This leaves us with enormous untapped potential that we absolutely must capitalize on. This is what brought me back to eBay and it's what the leadership team and I are committed to executing against. It will be a multiyear journey, but I believe we can drive long-term sustainable growth and generate significant value for shareholders. Our ambition to become the best global marketplace has been built with customers at the center, and an acknowledgment of the driving force of our success has always been and must continue to be our leadership in technology.  This is why the entire team at eBay is rallying around three key priorities to execute on the vision. One, to build compelling next gen experiences for our enthusiasts. Second, is become the partner of choice for our sellers and third is to cultivate lifelong trusted buyer relationships.  I will walk through each priority in more detail. Our first key priority is to defend the core business by building compelling next gen experiences for enthusiast customers. We will cater to them by focusing on two areas of historical strength: consumer selling and vertical experiences. Consumer sellers are dedicated eBay customers who have a proven track record of spending more than double the amount of buyers that don't sell on the platform. This group differentiates our global supply by bringing unique and compelling inventory at great value. We estimate that the average household in our major markets has approximately $4,000 worth of items to resell and is selling less than 20% of that online today. In addition to making extra money, by keeping products in circulation longer, customers are driving social and environmental benefits for all.  To lead in consumer selling, here are the areas where we intend to focus:  We will simplify the listing flow. It's currently too long and complicated and needs to be dramatically simplified. Next, we need to increase conversion to grow the number of consumer selling enthusiasts; and finally, we must make it easier for sellers to reinvest proceeds from their sales back in the things that they need, want and love on eBay.  One recent consumer selling launch streamlined the local pickup experience by leveraging QR scanning to complete in-person transactions. While we are pleased to see this tech-based simplification, there's a lot more to do to achieve the long-term objective of growing the number of consumer sellers on the platform. In terms of vertical experiences, we plan to focus on non-new-in-season products. Within these categories, we have unique inventory at scale, strong buyer consideration and loyal communities of buyers and sellers who connect through common interests and passions, not just to buy and sell merchandise.  This is an important focus for us as approximately half of our volume in major markets comes from these products. The TAM for these categories is expanding as more offline inventory transitions online. These categories span from luxury items to parts and accessories and motors to fashion, electronics, collectibles and more, and they represent the core of why people love eBay.  Our plan is to focus technology efforts on the evolving needs of these passionate enthusiasts, and we intend to accelerate growth in these categories in the coming years. The second key priority of our vision is to become the platform of choice for sellers. We will aim to inspire small businesses by introducing tools and features that compel them to start and grow their business on eBay. We will treat them like true partners by making the platform easier to use, grow their brand, drive their sales and carefully protect their reputation. By making eBay more compelling, we plan to grow the number of successful businesses on the platform. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses are already active today and tens of thousands have recently joined through programs like Up and Running across global markets.  Recently we launched several improvements to simplify registration and help sellers start and succeed on the platform. Additionally, we have boosted seller presence by launching store fronts in the mobile app and we will continue to iterate the Stores experience over time. Seller Hub tools continue to grow and in the past quarter, we launched several new features based on customer feedback. To name some improvements, we've started providing real-time competitive pricing and traffic data and also expanded multi-user authentication capabilities. Another great example is seller initiated offers, where sellers can send custom deals directly to buyers, which launched several new features in Q2 and is expected to drive over $1 billion in GMV in 2020. This demonstrates the power of the eBay platform where sellers can connect to individual buyers. To drive demand for sellers, we continue to augment Promoted Listings capabilities. In the second quarter, Promoted Listings delivered $196 million of revenue, up 124%. We see several growth levers including further promoted listings adoption, conversion improvements and ad product innovation designed to help sellers drive demand and grow their business. Finally, the third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong, trusted relationships with buyers. We plan to modernize and simplify the experience to drive more purchase frequency by leveraging AI teams to remove friction throughout the buying journey. In our highly rated app, we're delivering features that customers want. In June, we released dark mode on iOS and dark theme on Android, which was the most requested feature by customers, particularly our Gen Z customers. We also simplified search filtering on mobile, which is leading to an increase in sold items and better user efficiency. We've made significant incremental investments in three areas of marketing during Q2. First, we leaned into performance channels, which are delivering higher efficiency due to competitive spend reduction. Second, we incented more app downloads and adoption to improve buyer retention and third, we deployed a multichannel campaign to showcase sellers and continue to attract new small businesses. These SMBs bring great selection and value for buyers to discover.  We will continue to invest in the buyer experience and marketing technology capabilities as we work to foster lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. As we look forward, we have a clear vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay. This will be a multiyear process and will require investment but through a tech-led re-imagination, our plan is to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. And our key priorities to deliveries this vision are: to build compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts, to become the partner of choice for sellers and to cultivate lifelong trusted buyer relationships.  And while pursuing this vision, we will never lose sight of purpose, which is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all. It's that purpose that inspired the company and the eBay foundation to commit an additional $10 million in the second quarter to support COVID-19 relief efforts globally. Additionally, during the quarter we donated more than $1.3 million in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Equal Justice initiative in an effort to take action against systemic racism and injustice. With that, I'll turn the alter the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?\nAndy Cring: Thanks Jamie and thank you all for joining today. The last 90 days have been an incredibly exciting time for eBay. First, we've begun the process of ramping managed payments, which will greatly improve the experience for both buyers and sellers, while delivering incremental revenue and operating profit of the business. Second, we're extremely pleased with our announced agreement to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta for $9.2 billion in cash and stock. And third, we had an outstanding quarter financially. Our Marketplaces business continue to see significantly higher growth levels for traffic, buyers, conversion, GMV, revenue and operating margin and our business is recovering faster than our previous outlook. On the basis of that strength, we are raising our full-year guidance for revenue, earnings and free cash flow.  Marketplaces on platform GMV growth in both the US international markets was within the mid 30% range for the quarter with acceleration across all major verticals compared to Q1. We are well positioned to benefit from the offline to online shift that's occurring as we continue to deliver significant year-on-year volume growth. As Jamie said, while there is much to be proud of, we are certainly not satisfied. The current strength in demand is providing an opportunity for eBay to attract and retain new buyers and sellers and we're investing during this period to position the company for a higher long-term sustainable growth rate. Turning to slide four, in Q2 we delivered revenue of $2.9 billion up 22% on an organic FX neutral basis, above the high-end of our most recent guidance. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 up 63%. Non-GAAP margin was strong at 34.3% inclusive of our ongoing investments and managed payments. We generated $964 million of operating cash flow and $866 million of free cash flow. We returned to $112 million to shareholders in cash dividends in Q2. And, in early July, we completed our $3 billion accelerated share repurchase at an average share price of $40.77. Moving to active buyers on slide five, we ended Q2 with 182 million active buyers representing 5% year-on-year growth, accelerating three points from Q1 with new and reactivated buyers driving the acceleration. To put that number in perspective, the increase of approximately 8 million buyers in the trailing 12 month metric is more than we've seen in the last six quarters combined. While the growth rate in the trailing 12 month metric is a bit muted, we are excited about the significant increase in buyers and are focused on increasing engagement and retention. It's clear that stay-at-home mandates and a more restrictive offline shopping environment drove more buyers online. While it's extremely early in the lifecycle of these newly acquired buyers, in the second quarter we saw increased engagement. Repurchase rate, frequency, multi-category shopping and migration to the app are all significantly higher than previous cohorts. And our retained buyer base is purchasing with a higher frequency compared to the pre-pandemic levels. Moving to slide six, in Q2 we enabled $27.1 billion of marketplace GMV up 29% year-on-year accelerating 29 points versus the prior quarter. The growth in volume was driven primarily by consumer behavioral shift to online shopping, which brought more buyers to the platform, who on average spend more per buyer than in the past. Approximately, 80% of the GMV growth came from increased purchase frequency in our existing buyer base and the remaining growth came from new buyers. In the US, we generated $10.5 billion of GMV, up 35% year-on-year and accelerated 39 points from Q1. Although it's difficult to precisely measure given the magnitude of volume, the year-on-year growth figure includes a four point headwind from the continued impact of Internet sales tax across the US, improving two points compared to Q1 and slightly better than our expectations. Next quarter will be the last quarter with a material impact on growth rates as the majority of states have gone live before October 01, 2019. Please refer to the appendix to see the impact of Internet sales tax over time. International GMV was up 26% accelerating 23 points versus Q1, driven by strength in the UK and Germany. Growth in Korea was 5% decelerating one point. Looking to revenue on slide seven, for the company, we generated net revenues of $2.9 billion up 22% organically, accelerating 20 points from Q1. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue up 33% and $418 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 20%, inclusive of a five point headwind from the sale of Brands 4 Friends. Turning to slide eight, our marketplace revenue was $2.7 billion, up 26%, accelerating 25 points from the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 33%, a 30 point acceleration versus Q1, driven by strength in GMV and promoted listings. Marketing services and other revenue was down 16% decelerating one point versus Q1. The year-on-year decline is driven by 11 points from the sale of Brands 4 Friends, in addition to lower third-party ads, partially offset by growth in our Korea first party business, which grew at over 80% year-on-year. Marketplace segment margin was 40%, up eight points year-on-year. The margin expansion was driven by strong volume leverage and continued cost control, partially offset by incremental marketing and technology investments as we aim to increase engagement with new buyers cohorts and accelerated product delivery. Moving to slide nine, in Q2, Classifieds had a tremendous quarter in an incredibly tough environment. The leadership team had to deal with the realities of the pandemic pressures and the uncertainty of a pending transaction. Through it all the team executed beyond expectations. Revenue was down 24% year-on-year decelerating 24 points versus Q1, driven by motors fee discounts in addition to continued headwinds and display advertising across markets. Revenue growth was at its lowest point in April before delivering steady acceleration through May and June. The acceleration was primarily driven by a combination of ending the fee discounts we provided to dealers as lockdown restrictions eased through the quarter, and modest improvements in advertising. Performance was ahead of our expectations as the recovery in motors and ads materialize more quickly than originally anticipated. Segment margin for classifieds was 30%, down eight points year-on-year, driven primarily by fee discounts, which resulted in lower topline leverage and our continued investment in verticals, partially offset by a reduction in sales and marketing spend. Last week we came to an agreement to transfer our classifieds business to Adevinta for $9.2 billion. Upon closing, eBay will receive $2.5 billion in cash which we anticipate will yield approximately $2 billion net of taxes. In addition, eBay will receive 540 million shares of Adevinta valued as of the July 17 closing share price at $6.7 billion. While the value of this stake will move with the share price from Adevinta, early positive reactions indicate alignment with our view of the long-term value in this combination. We are excited about this deal as it allows us to realize near-term value while also enabling us to participate in the future upside potential of the world's largest online Classifieds company. Turning to slide 10 and major cost drivers; in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 34%. This is approximately five points higher year-on-year driven by marketplace volume leverage and continued cost control, partially offset by the impact of lower classifieds revenue and our investment in managed payments. Cost of revenue is down nearly two points year-on-year as a percentage of revenue as volume leverage more than offset investment in managed payments and are expanding first party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over three points versus the prior year as marketplace volume leverage and Classifieds spend reductions were partially offset by reinvestments in the marketplace segment. Product development costs were down one point driven by volume leverage, partially offset by incremental investments in the product experience, including managed payments. G&A was up 30 basis points as leverage and cost actions were more than offset by advisor costs associated with the cost price transactions, charitable donations and cost related to the closure of a large office. Transaction losses have grown approximately 70 basis points driven by volume and modest rate increases in our bad debt and eBay money back guarantee reserves. Turning to EPS on slide 11, in Q2 we delivered $1.08 of non-GAAP EPS up 63% versus the prior year, our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-GAAP EPS expansion. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher revenue growth and our share repurchase program, partially offset by the impact of a stronger US dollar and our investment in managed payments. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.04 up 125% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the change in fair value of the Adyen warrant, in the quarter and the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by a higher tax rate driven by our California tax law change. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to slide 12, in Q2 we generated $866 million of free cash flow up 54% driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash taxes. Moving to slide 13, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and investments and debt of $8.7 billion. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and are leveraging the current market to improve the rates we're paying on our outstanding debt. In Q2, we issued $750 million of debt bringing our total debt raise for the first half to $1.75 billion. We are using the proceeds to retire our 2020 and 2021 debt maturities. In Q2 we repaid approximately $830 million and we expect to pay the remaining $920 million by the end of Q3. We paid $112 million in dividends in the quarter. In early June, we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase plan we announced in February at an average price per share of $40.77. We have $500 million in share buyback left to hit the $4.5 billion in our guidance. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our capital allocation strategy, key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our triple B plus credit rating, midterm leverage of approximately 1.5 times net debt and gross debt below three times EBITDA and a target cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Turning to slide 14 and guidance, the guidance we are providing assumes Classifieds results are included in both Q3 and full year. We will provide updates moving forward as appropriate. As we indicated in April, this is an unusually dynamic time without historical precedent and presents challenges in drawing conclusions on trends and outlooks beyond the immediate term. In April we experienced a significant broad-based acceleration. At the time it was unclear how long that strength would last or when growth rates would return to pre-pandemic levels, if ever. What we observed throughout the second quarter varied across geographies, in countries like Germany and Italy, we saw the height of GMV growth in April and then began to see moderation of growth as these countries began to reopen. Although growth levels continue to be higher than pre-COVID levels. In the US where the impact of the virus continues at elevated levels, growth has been steady through July so far. Across most markets, we have yet to settle back into a new baseline, making it harder to accurately forecast future growth rates. We are however providing updates to both our Q3 and full year guidance today. Our visibility in the near-term is clear but beyond Q3, it's harder to predict exactly how buyer behavior, retail channels shifts and changes in the economic environment will affect our outcome. There is a model of e-commerce growth recovery from a global pandemic and considering these factors, we see a wider range of potential outcomes. Our guidance assumes continued growth moderation across most of our portfolio, throughout Q3, assuming consumer mobility continues to improve. We expect to continue to invest in technology and marketing to maximize our opportunity to exit the pandemic at a higher growth rate than we entered. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.71 billion growing 14% to 17% on an organic FX neutral basis. This assumes marketplaces' volume growth in the high teens with gradual growth moderation through the quarter. In Classifieds, we are projecting revenue acceleration from the second quarter. We expect managed payments to continue to deliver revenue acceleration, contributing approximately three points to Q3 revenue at the midpoint of our guide, partially based on heightened GMV growth rate, but also on strong execution. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 to $0.87 per share, representing 27% to 36% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by marketplaces volume and lower share count, partially offset by continuing investments in technology and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share in Q3. For the full year, we are increasing our revenue guidance to the range of $10.56 billion to $10.75 billion and organic FX neutral growth of 12% to 14%. This represents marketplace revenue growth in the mid-teens and classifieds revenue at negative mid-single digits. We are raising operating margin to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5% and maintaining a non-GAAP effective tax rate of between 15.5% and 17.5%. With the above dynamics, we are increasing our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.47 to $3.59 per share. We are increasing our free cash flow to $2.55 billion to $2.7 billion and narrowing the CapEx range to 4% to 5% of revenue. Finally, we are increasing full year GAAP EPS to $2.85 dollars to $3 per share. In closing we feel great about our progress. The business performance continues to be very strong. Our revenue growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising are on track, reducing friction on the site and providing more options for buyers and sellers. We're well on our way to delivering our cost structure improvements that will drive at least two points of operating margin growth by 2022 as compared with 2019. We are excited to have clarity on the next steps for Classifieds in a transaction that we believe creates great near-term value with the opportunity for more shareholder value over time. While we've made great progress, we know we have more work to do to achieve our full potential and we're focusing all resources towards driving improvement in the marketplaces business to fully realize the opportunity in front of us. With that Jamie and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Jamie, great to work with you again. I know you mentioned you're starting a lot of competitions with sellers. I know you\u2019re trying to improve the selling process. I guess what complaints do you hear from the sellers and how quickly can you act on it? And then as a follow-up, obviously there\u2019s some great momentum because of the current situation. I guess any specific plans to maintain those buyers and keep them active? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, good to hear your voice Ed. So on the seller side, what we're really focused on is how do we make that initial process of coming on to the platform extremely easy. So simplifying the registration process, simplifying onboarding and simplifying getting up and running on the experience. And then as they progress and build their business on eBay, how do we give them more tools and capabilities to help them continue to grow that business on eBay. We talked about one, which is enhancing our stores product, bringing that into the native app. I'll be honest with you though, I think we have a lot more work to do in areas like that where we can make it even better and give them increased tools. And so that's going to be a huge focus for us on that second pillar of being the partner of choice for sellers. On the momentum, we feel great about the 8 million new buyers. It's been -- it's more than the last six quarters combined. And what we're really focused on is turning those buyers into enthusiasts and keeping them on the platform. So you saw us this quarter reinvest in areas like app downloads and convincing new buyers on the platform to get the app. That's where the majority of our transactions happen on the platform. And I talked about some of the innovations that we're doing there like the dark mode on the app which is exciting, but we're also working on revamping the whole onboarding process for buyers, so how they come in, their first 30 days.  And we've just started that this quarter to really take advantage of the new buyers. But that's part of the vision that we've laid out is really just enhancing that ability to bring buyers along on the journey and increase their lifetime value with us. But we're excited by what we're seeing, excited by the early momentum of what we're witnessing from those buyers.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one the 2Q or sorry the 3Q GMV commentary. I think you talked to sort of teens growth inferred in the guidance, but it sounds like the US has been sort of steady. So the question is what are you seeing in the US that is steady? Is that still growing over 30? And what are the assumptions in sort of the deceleration in GMV throughout the quarter and the guidance. Why would that slow down? And then the second one, sort of bigger picture question. Maybe talk to us a little bit about the demographic of these new buyers you\u2019ve brought on, are you cracking into new types of household, new income of households? Who are the new people and how are they different from the older eBay buyers? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so I'll start and take the second one and then Andy maybe you can take the first one. So what I\u2019d say on the demographics of the new buyers that we're bringing is it's really across the board and across all geographies. So all of our major market saw strong a buyer growth and it's really two fold. One, it's new buyers actually coming on to the platform and then it's also reactivating existing buyers or buyers that had a bit on the platform but hadn\u2019t purchased for us for a while. And then obviously a huge amount of growth with also just our existing buyers buying more. But what we're working on and you probably saw this in some of the TV advertising that we're doing and some of the digital is really appealing to the fact that small businesses are bringing unique inventory on to eBay and attracting buyers across the board. A key focus for us over the next couple years will be our GEN-Y customers. That\u2019s why we've made certain investments in our sneakers business and growing that and also why a feature like dark mode in mobile app also appears to younger demographic. So it will be a continued focus for us, Brian, over the next quarters and years. Andy, do you want to take the first one?\nAndy Cring: Hey Brian, on guidance, look, as I said in my prepared remarks, there is a lot of unknowns. I'll say that we know more today than we did in April and we see more trends. I don't want to get into specific country and monthly trends, but we've seen an increased correlation with mobility around the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, particularly Germany, Italy and countries where the mobility is improving and approaching in some cases pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a moderation in growth rate. That growth rate is still about pre-COVID levels, but it's lower than it was at the peak. And then similarly in the US, yes the growth rate is stronger than -- its not stronger, it's sustained, but it's stronger than some of the other countries given the given some of the progress on the virus that we had in the US.\nOperator: Your next question is Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: I have two, first Jamie, you talked about the tech-led re-imagination of eBay. Can you just talk about the company's ability to retain and attract the right engineering and product talent to make this happen and how you shift eBay to be more positioned with this tech-driven approach? And then just second, can you also just talk about the decision to keep the 44% stake in Classifieds? Did you start there or how much was that influenced by the current environment and the recent pressure on the segment? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on the first one Doug, on the technology side, you're absolutely right. A huge focus for us. So first off, we have a really great world-class technology team in a lot of different geographies in the business. But we are focusing on augmenting that with even new capabilities. So we're building up our capabilities in AI and data science and computer vision. You may have seen features like easy image enhancing for our sellers. All that's coming out of kind of a next gen technology group that we've been building up. But it's a key focus for us because in that tech-led re-imagination, this company has been and always will be about how to create those game-changing technologies. To be candid though, there is also areas where we've got to get off of old legacy technologies. So part of it is just moving off of some of the older technology stack and modernizing that. The good news is that's in progress, but we're accelerating even that work. On the Classifieds deal, what I'd say is that we're really excited by the combination of the assets that our Classifieds business combined with Adevinta. When you look at the two of them together, it creates 20 leading markets in the classifieds business and creates the world's largest online classifieds business. So we're excited because it not only gives value to shareholders in the short term, but it allow us to participate in the long-term potential of this exciting new venture. And then the third thing that was important for us is now that we've divested StubHub and with his transfer of assets on Classifieds, it allows the whole management team, all of our technologists, the whole organization to focus on the Marketplace business. And then as you stated, in my remarks, I see a lot of untapped potential in that business. But there\u2019s also areas where we haven't kept pace. And so I think that focus will also be good for the whole organization.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Jamie welcome aboard by the way. So it sounds like you want to consolidate a lot more of the out-of-season and as well as a more unique inventory, both new and used. So theoretically, you'll see a greater variety of merchandise and hopefully a spike in listings. But given the company's history with data and figuring out what people are buying and selling, what can you do to make sure that you maintain or even improve the buying experience? And secondarily, interested in following up with what you brought up earlier in terms of generating liquidity for consumers as they sell things on eBay. After they sold what they wanted to sell, they have the money which they can go spend anywhere. So what can you do to make sure that the money that they generated on eBay stays on eBay? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so great question. I'll start with the liquidity one. One of the benefits of the managed payments that we're launching and scaling here, we added several new countries and now we're able to really grow and ramp that with the changes a week ago with the expiration of the PayPal agreement. It is the exact ability to do what you're saying. So to make it easier for sellers and buyers to have their whole wallet and payments contained on the platform, it gives us more flexibility of things that we can do to really make that easy for them and so obviously transference is a huge benefit. The other thing I would say is that just getting buyers to sell, so just getting them to try it out, bring some inventory on, makes them a better buyer and it's because they've played on both sides of the marketplace. They've experienced the power of eBay. And so what we've seen is there a more than doubling of benefit to their buying behavior just like getting them to try selling. So we're really happy with that flywheel effect, it's something we're going to continue to lean into. As I've talked about the first pillar of consumer selling, that's the key piece of it. To your question on the inventory, we feel really beneficial because of the open and level playing field that we have. We can bring on that new consumer selling inventory, which is really valuable to have on the platform because it attracts a lot of buyers along with the SMB inventory that's there. And when I say we're focusing and getting back to non-new in-season it's not saying that you're not going to be able to buy a ton of new product, in-season product on eBay. We'll have that and always have that. But in terms of our focus, we think there is this massive opportunity, $500 billion in what eBay is fantastic and unique at. And we can build great fertile experiences. We can attract that supply. And that's where I believe there is just an enormous amount of untapped potential in going after it. And so really making sure that we nail everything about the buying experience end-to-end, having extreme customer focus will allows us to capture the potential.\nOperator: Your next question is from Thomas Forte of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Forte: I have two high-level questions. So Jamie I wanted to know what success looks like from a sales standpoint? Do you aspire to have sustainable double-digit FX-neutral topline growth? And then second, I wanted to know what your preference was on capital allocation, M&A versus buyback versus dividend? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so look, what we're really focused on is how do we improve the overall experience between buyers and sellers and create a really healthy business in the long term. So I think the things that we've laid out lead us to a long-term healthy growth of the core Marketplace business. We\u2019re not going to quantify the long term what those numbers are, but I think the steps that we're going to take there will get us to a point where we're driving healthy growth. In terms of the capital allocation, we're going to stick really to the capital tenets that we've been talking about all along. And Andy, do you just want to reiterate what those are?\nAndy Cring: Look, I think if you look at the history of what we've done since separation, I think it's close to $20 billion or maybe a little over $20 billion of return to shareholders either through dividends or share buyback. And it's important to step back at that and then look at what we've done recently with StubHub. And our view is the most value we create for shareholders is going to be getting the Marketplace business back to growth. So we're going to continue to balance margin, growth rate, M&A, buyback in all of those different levers with the purpose of improving the performance of marketplace business and increasing shareholder value.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Sebastian of Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Jamie, welcome back and thanks the vision for the Marketplace longer-term. And I'd like to start there, specifically going back to the technology reinvestments. We have seen some of that over the last four or five years with structured data. And so I hope you can provide a little bit more context on the scale of that investment. Is this more tactical things? I mean there's been investment in data science and AI already. Or is this with the re-platforming away from the older stack, is this a larger scale technology investment phase? And then secondly on managed payments, so congrats on that finally formally progressing. Was curious how that's not only the pace of managed payments transferring over, but also what the roadmap looks like in things like seller financing, buy now pay later, things that sellers and buyers had with PayPal that I assume are part of the eBay managed payments over time as well. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on the first question, it's two parts, it's one about where we're focusing our technology investments. And a key part of that is that I think for quite some time we were chasing a little bit the new in-season and not really focused on what's the core experience and how do we leverage technology in those key core verticals where eBay has an amazing stronghold and in the inventory in a non-new in-season where there is a over $500 billion opportunity. And so to be candid, I feel like there are certain areas we let niche competitors take business away from eBay that should be done on eBay and shows you the potential that we have on eBay, if we really focus our technology effort in those areas that we know are features, tools, capability and new experiences that help buyers and sellers connect. A small example of that is, while we don't have a huge pickup business and there's a lot of categories where people do meet in person to exchange goods. And we just made it more seamless through these QR codes for the buyer and the seller. It's kind of a magical experience, the money flows and that's the benefit of doing managed payments and technology together as we can create those experiences for buyers and sellers. On the managed payments side, what we're really focused on right now is scaling that business. So we've got a lot of work left to do in kind of opening up all of the remaining geographies, bringing more sellers on, etc. But once we do hit that point, yes, like we're talking about earlier, there's opportunities to do more and help connect, and make it more streamlined for sellers on the payments. We do have a buy now, pay later option, our monthly pay option. That's in partnership with PayPal. PayPal continues to be an option for how to pay on the platform and a key partner for us. But to answer your question, yes, we'll be continually looking at ways that we'll make buying and selling via payments easier, and managed payments gives us that flexibility.\nAndy Cring: Hey, Colin, maybe one more thing on margin rate. I just want to reiterate from my script the -- we remain committed to the margin commitments from last year, at least 2 points of margin by the time we get to 2022. And -- but through that time, we're going to -- you'll see us invest with balance and we're going to pace incremental revenue -- incremental investments with growth rate and earnings along the way. So no change to the long-term margin structure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ygal Arounian of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So the [indiscernible] macro GMV level, just -- you noted in some of the international geographies that where mobility is getting back to normal, the growth rates go higher than pre-pandemic but coming down from the peak. Is there any way to quantify that a little bit more? Is it slightly above where it was before? Meaningfully above? And any way in the US to quantify it, think about what the contributions from stimulus has been? And is the pace of the pandemic, really the biggest piece of why the US GMV was so much stronger than internationally? And then one -- real brief one on payments, just thinking about where you have intermediated and managed payments has rolled out for those merchants, any positive signals you're seeing in terms of better conversion, anything else that's really giving you kind of good feel or good outlook of why and how managed payments can drive better opportunities for stronger GMV growth going forward? Thanks.\nAndy Cring: I'll start I think with the second one on US contributions. I think it's really hard to point to any one thing, particularly stimulus is having a major -- being a major driver. I'm sure there is some impact at some level. I going to point back to the best thing we've seen globally in terms of an indicator is mobility. So -- and I think it is fair to say the US is significantly stronger than international regions, just given the impact of the virus in the US. In terms of -- on the macro question on international levels of GMV, pre-pandemic versus post, I think I'd point you probably to the Q3 guide relative to Q2 actuals. If you have the US -- similar to Q2 levels and the company with moderation of -- from a 29% growth rate to a high teens, you'll start to see -- you can back into maybe a little bit of the pressure in international. In addition to the fact that internationally, keep in mind, Korea with relatively stable growth rates quarter-over-quarter and significantly lower with much less impact from COVID in Q2 and into Q3. So again, moderating growth rates but still sufficiently higher than pre-COVID.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Then what I'd say on the managed payment side is a couple of encouraging things. One is the feedback that we're getting from sellers, generally very positive. The vast majority of them will see lower fees and have a simpler fee structure with the result of rolling it out. And a lot of them have signed up, pre-registered, so waiting for when we can open up the platform which we did two weeks ago. And I would say the same thing on the buyer side, especially for a new buyer, creates a lot less friction. And so we are excited and optimistic for what that means for the overall experience. And when I talk about a tech-led re-imagination, payments is the perfect example. It just makes the whole experience easier and better. We committed to it and put a lot of resources behind making it a great experience. And so far that's the feedback that we've been getting by both buyers and sellers.\nOperator: Your next question is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks. Jamie, welcome back to eBay. A couple of questions, I guess, big picture thinking about how the management team is now compensated, is it relative growth to the e-commerce industry, is it overall growth, is it certain margin targets? Could you talk a little bit about the incentive team for the management team -- incentive structure? And then the company has gone through a pretty big period here of divestiture and cash returns. How do you think about if that could change, do you see adjacent M&A opportunities? Do you see a real chance here post-COVID to really accelerate growth? Just talk about kind of is there kind of a big change going on at eBay at this point or more of the same, but hopefully some innovation on the edges? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So our incentive structure really hasn't changed over the years and it's based on a combination of top and bottom line. On the M&A opportunities and the acceleration, the focus, what I'd say has changed is the whole organization is now really focused on the vision that I have outlined. Now that without StubHub and now with Classifieds transferred to Adevinta, you've got the whole organization thinking about this overall tech-led reimagination from technology, marketing, product and these three kind of key focus areas. And so, yeah, we will look at opportunistic M&A where we think we can really help accelerate that focus on the core business. But like I said before, we see a huge amount of untapped potential just in going after these key experiences in key verticals of getting back to that kind of core C2C selling. And moving this idea I think for some years, we were acquiring buyers at all costs and really focusing on how do we turn buyers into lifelong trusted relationships and putting all of our efforts across product, marketing, technology, etc., around that focus. And I think it's that focus and that lean-in on the technology side in a big way, that's going to allow us to capture it.\nJoe Billante: Operator, I think we've got time for one more.\nOperator: Your last question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. We obviously, talked about a lot of investments in technology, so I won't go down that path. But when you think about maybe the marketing side of things and sort of how you want to think about customer acquisition from here, particularly as the tailwind from the current environment that we're in potentially starts to dissipate, how should we think about the level of investment that you want to see? And to the extent that there is a path, there sort of an optimal channel mix that you see is sort of working better for eBay in the future than maybe what we've seen in the past? Given your background obviously, would really appreciate sort of how you're seeing that side of the opportunity.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So look this quarter, on the marketing side -- Heath, a great question. On the marketing side, we were able to lean in pretty well to the new buyers that we are acquiring. So both with kind of brand advertising talking about the small businesses, but also in a less competitive environment on the performance side of the business. When I talk about marketing, it's not just the spend, but it's also just our CRM programs, how we communicate, how we leverage things like email notifications, etc. And I think that we've built some good capabilities over the years, but I think we have a massive opportunity there to help buyers get up the lifecycle in an even better way. So that will also be an opportunity that we're really focused on. On the channel mix, we have the benefit of obviously, having lots of different channels for driving it. I would say the newest ones that we're really focused on are acquiring the Gen Y customers and looking at new opportunities in paid social and going after and making sure that customer is attracted. I talked to kind of really understanding the categories that attract that demographic on the platform. And so, I think you'll see slight shifts in terms of the marketing mix that we're looking at. But overall, we tend to leverage all the channels that we have to maximize the ROI that we can get off of that spend. And as I talked about, we're really focused on how do we get not just a new buyer onto the platform, but how we turn that new buyer into an enthusiast. And that's where I think the real unlock and the power of the model lies.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andy Cring",
            "content": "Thanks Jamie and thank you all for joining today. The last 90 days have been an incredibly exciting time for eBay. First, we've begun the process of ramping managed payments, which will greatly improve the experience for both buyers and sellers, while delivering incremental revenue and operating profit of the business. Second, we're extremely pleased with our announced agreement to transfer our Classifieds business to Adevinta for $9.2 billion in cash and stock. And third, we had an outstanding quarter financially. Our Marketplaces business continue to see significantly higher growth levels for traffic, buyers, conversion, GMV, revenue and operating margin and our business is recovering faster than our previous outlook. On the basis of that strength, we are raising our full-year guidance for revenue, earnings and free cash flow.  Marketplaces on platform GMV growth in both the US international markets was within the mid 30% range for the quarter with acceleration across all major verticals compared to Q1. We are well positioned to benefit from the offline to online shift that's occurring as we continue to deliver significant year-on-year volume growth. As Jamie said, while there is much to be proud of, we are certainly not satisfied. The current strength in demand is providing an opportunity for eBay to attract and retain new buyers and sellers and we're investing during this period to position the company for a higher long-term sustainable growth rate. Turning to slide four, in Q2 we delivered revenue of $2.9 billion up 22% on an organic FX neutral basis, above the high-end of our most recent guidance. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.08 up 63%. Non-GAAP margin was strong at 34.3% inclusive of our ongoing investments and managed payments. We generated $964 million of operating cash flow and $866 million of free cash flow. We returned to $112 million to shareholders in cash dividends in Q2. And, in early July, we completed our $3 billion accelerated share repurchase at an average share price of $40.77. Moving to active buyers on slide five, we ended Q2 with 182 million active buyers representing 5% year-on-year growth, accelerating three points from Q1 with new and reactivated buyers driving the acceleration. To put that number in perspective, the increase of approximately 8 million buyers in the trailing 12 month metric is more than we've seen in the last six quarters combined. While the growth rate in the trailing 12 month metric is a bit muted, we are excited about the significant increase in buyers and are focused on increasing engagement and retention. It's clear that stay-at-home mandates and a more restrictive offline shopping environment drove more buyers online. While it's extremely early in the lifecycle of these newly acquired buyers, in the second quarter we saw increased engagement. Repurchase rate, frequency, multi-category shopping and migration to the app are all significantly higher than previous cohorts. And our retained buyer base is purchasing with a higher frequency compared to the pre-pandemic levels. Moving to slide six, in Q2 we enabled $27.1 billion of marketplace GMV up 29% year-on-year accelerating 29 points versus the prior quarter. The growth in volume was driven primarily by consumer behavioral shift to online shopping, which brought more buyers to the platform, who on average spend more per buyer than in the past. Approximately, 80% of the GMV growth came from increased purchase frequency in our existing buyer base and the remaining growth came from new buyers. In the US, we generated $10.5 billion of GMV, up 35% year-on-year and accelerated 39 points from Q1. Although it's difficult to precisely measure given the magnitude of volume, the year-on-year growth figure includes a four point headwind from the continued impact of Internet sales tax across the US, improving two points compared to Q1 and slightly better than our expectations. Next quarter will be the last quarter with a material impact on growth rates as the majority of states have gone live before October 01, 2019. Please refer to the appendix to see the impact of Internet sales tax over time. International GMV was up 26% accelerating 23 points versus Q1, driven by strength in the UK and Germany. Growth in Korea was 5% decelerating one point. Looking to revenue on slide seven, for the company, we generated net revenues of $2.9 billion up 22% organically, accelerating 20 points from Q1. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue up 33% and $418 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 20%, inclusive of a five point headwind from the sale of Brands 4 Friends. Turning to slide eight, our marketplace revenue was $2.7 billion, up 26%, accelerating 25 points from the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 33%, a 30 point acceleration versus Q1, driven by strength in GMV and promoted listings. Marketing services and other revenue was down 16% decelerating one point versus Q1. The year-on-year decline is driven by 11 points from the sale of Brands 4 Friends, in addition to lower third-party ads, partially offset by growth in our Korea first party business, which grew at over 80% year-on-year. Marketplace segment margin was 40%, up eight points year-on-year. The margin expansion was driven by strong volume leverage and continued cost control, partially offset by incremental marketing and technology investments as we aim to increase engagement with new buyers cohorts and accelerated product delivery. Moving to slide nine, in Q2, Classifieds had a tremendous quarter in an incredibly tough environment. The leadership team had to deal with the realities of the pandemic pressures and the uncertainty of a pending transaction. Through it all the team executed beyond expectations. Revenue was down 24% year-on-year decelerating 24 points versus Q1, driven by motors fee discounts in addition to continued headwinds and display advertising across markets. Revenue growth was at its lowest point in April before delivering steady acceleration through May and June. The acceleration was primarily driven by a combination of ending the fee discounts we provided to dealers as lockdown restrictions eased through the quarter, and modest improvements in advertising. Performance was ahead of our expectations as the recovery in motors and ads materialize more quickly than originally anticipated. Segment margin for classifieds was 30%, down eight points year-on-year, driven primarily by fee discounts, which resulted in lower topline leverage and our continued investment in verticals, partially offset by a reduction in sales and marketing spend. Last week we came to an agreement to transfer our classifieds business to Adevinta for $9.2 billion. Upon closing, eBay will receive $2.5 billion in cash which we anticipate will yield approximately $2 billion net of taxes. In addition, eBay will receive 540 million shares of Adevinta valued as of the July 17 closing share price at $6.7 billion. While the value of this stake will move with the share price from Adevinta, early positive reactions indicate alignment with our view of the long-term value in this combination. We are excited about this deal as it allows us to realize near-term value while also enabling us to participate in the future upside potential of the world's largest online Classifieds company. Turning to slide 10 and major cost drivers; in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 34%. This is approximately five points higher year-on-year driven by marketplace volume leverage and continued cost control, partially offset by the impact of lower classifieds revenue and our investment in managed payments. Cost of revenue is down nearly two points year-on-year as a percentage of revenue as volume leverage more than offset investment in managed payments and are expanding first party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over three points versus the prior year as marketplace volume leverage and Classifieds spend reductions were partially offset by reinvestments in the marketplace segment. Product development costs were down one point driven by volume leverage, partially offset by incremental investments in the product experience, including managed payments. G&A was up 30 basis points as leverage and cost actions were more than offset by advisor costs associated with the cost price transactions, charitable donations and cost related to the closure of a large office. Transaction losses have grown approximately 70 basis points driven by volume and modest rate increases in our bad debt and eBay money back guarantee reserves. Turning to EPS on slide 11, in Q2 we delivered $1.08 of non-GAAP EPS up 63% versus the prior year, our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-GAAP EPS expansion. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher revenue growth and our share repurchase program, partially offset by the impact of a stronger US dollar and our investment in managed payments. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.04 up 125% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the change in fair value of the Adyen warrant, in the quarter and the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by a higher tax rate driven by our California tax law change. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to slide 12, in Q2 we generated $866 million of free cash flow up 54% driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash taxes. Moving to slide 13, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and investments and debt of $8.7 billion. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and are leveraging the current market to improve the rates we're paying on our outstanding debt. In Q2, we issued $750 million of debt bringing our total debt raise for the first half to $1.75 billion. We are using the proceeds to retire our 2020 and 2021 debt maturities. In Q2 we repaid approximately $830 million and we expect to pay the remaining $920 million by the end of Q3. We paid $112 million in dividends in the quarter. In early June, we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase plan we announced in February at an average price per share of $40.77. We have $500 million in share buyback left to hit the $4.5 billion in our guidance. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our capital allocation strategy, key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our triple B plus credit rating, midterm leverage of approximately 1.5 times net debt and gross debt below three times EBITDA and a target cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Turning to slide 14 and guidance, the guidance we are providing assumes Classifieds results are included in both Q3 and full year. We will provide updates moving forward as appropriate. As we indicated in April, this is an unusually dynamic time without historical precedent and presents challenges in drawing conclusions on trends and outlooks beyond the immediate term. In April we experienced a significant broad-based acceleration. At the time it was unclear how long that strength would last or when growth rates would return to pre-pandemic levels, if ever. What we observed throughout the second quarter varied across geographies, in countries like Germany and Italy, we saw the height of GMV growth in April and then began to see moderation of growth as these countries began to reopen. Although growth levels continue to be higher than pre-COVID levels. In the US where the impact of the virus continues at elevated levels, growth has been steady through July so far. Across most markets, we have yet to settle back into a new baseline, making it harder to accurately forecast future growth rates. We are however providing updates to both our Q3 and full year guidance today. Our visibility in the near-term is clear but beyond Q3, it's harder to predict exactly how buyer behavior, retail channels shifts and changes in the economic environment will affect our outcome. There is a model of e-commerce growth recovery from a global pandemic and considering these factors, we see a wider range of potential outcomes. Our guidance assumes continued growth moderation across most of our portfolio, throughout Q3, assuming consumer mobility continues to improve. We expect to continue to invest in technology and marketing to maximize our opportunity to exit the pandemic at a higher growth rate than we entered. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.71 billion growing 14% to 17% on an organic FX neutral basis. This assumes marketplaces' volume growth in the high teens with gradual growth moderation through the quarter. In Classifieds, we are projecting revenue acceleration from the second quarter. We expect managed payments to continue to deliver revenue acceleration, contributing approximately three points to Q3 revenue at the midpoint of our guide, partially based on heightened GMV growth rate, but also on strong execution. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 to $0.87 per share, representing 27% to 36% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by marketplaces volume and lower share count, partially offset by continuing investments in technology and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.58 to $0.64 per share in Q3. For the full year, we are increasing our revenue guidance to the range of $10.56 billion to $10.75 billion and organic FX neutral growth of 12% to 14%. This represents marketplace revenue growth in the mid-teens and classifieds revenue at negative mid-single digits. We are raising operating margin to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5% and maintaining a non-GAAP effective tax rate of between 15.5% and 17.5%. With the above dynamics, we are increasing our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.47 to $3.59 per share. We are increasing our free cash flow to $2.55 billion to $2.7 billion and narrowing the CapEx range to 4% to 5% of revenue. Finally, we are increasing full year GAAP EPS to $2.85 dollars to $3 per share. In closing we feel great about our progress. The business performance continues to be very strong. Our revenue growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising are on track, reducing friction on the site and providing more options for buyers and sellers. We're well on our way to delivering our cost structure improvements that will drive at least two points of operating margin growth by 2022 as compared with 2019. We are excited to have clarity on the next steps for Classifieds in a transaction that we believe creates great near-term value with the opportunity for more shareholder value over time. While we've made great progress, we know we have more work to do to achieve our full potential and we're focusing all resources towards driving improvement in the marketplaces business to fully realize the opportunity in front of us. With that Jamie and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator? Hey Brian, on guidance, look, as I said in my prepared remarks, there is a lot of unknowns. I'll say that we know more today than we did in April and we see more trends. I don't want to get into specific country and monthly trends, but we've seen an increased correlation with mobility around the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, particularly Germany, Italy and countries where the mobility is improving and approaching in some cases pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a moderation in growth rate. That growth rate is still about pre-COVID levels, but it's lower than it was at the peak. And then similarly in the US, yes the growth rate is stronger than -- its not stronger, it's sustained, but it's stronger than some of the other countries given the given some of the progress on the virus that we had in the US. Look, I think if you look at the history of what we've done since separation, I think it's close to $20 billion or maybe a little over $20 billion of return to shareholders either through dividends or share buyback. And it's important to step back at that and then look at what we've done recently with StubHub. And our view is the most value we create for shareholders is going to be getting the Marketplace business back to growth. So we're going to continue to balance margin, growth rate, M&A, buyback in all of those different levers with the purpose of improving the performance of marketplace business and increasing shareholder value. Hey, Colin, maybe one more thing on margin rate. I just want to reiterate from my script the -- we remain committed to the margin commitments from last year, at least 2 points of margin by the time we get to 2022. And -- but through that time, we're going to -- you'll see us invest with balance and we're going to pace incremental revenue -- incremental investments with growth rate and earnings along the way. So no change to the long-term margin structure. I'll start I think with the second one on US contributions. I think it's really hard to point to any one thing, particularly stimulus is having a major -- being a major driver. I'm sure there is some impact at some level. I going to point back to the best thing we've seen globally in terms of an indicator is mobility. So -- and I think it is fair to say the US is significantly stronger than international regions, just given the impact of the virus in the US. In terms of -- on the macro question on international levels of GMV, pre-pandemic versus post, I think I'd point you probably to the Q3 guide relative to Q2 actuals. If you have the US -- similar to Q2 levels and the company with moderation of -- from a 29% growth rate to a high teens, you'll start to see -- you can back into maybe a little bit of the pressure in international. In addition to the fact that internationally, keep in mind, Korea with relatively stable growth rates quarter-over-quarter and significantly lower with much less impact from COVID in Q2 and into Q3. So again, moderating growth rates but still sufficiently higher than pre-COVID."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Andy to discuss our recent performance and near-term outlook, I'll take some time to share thought on my return to eBay, highlight a few observations from the quarter and share our vision for the company. I'm thrilled to be speaking with all of you today as CEO of eBay. I've long admired this unique company for its special culture and its enormous potential.  I spent my first 100 days primarily focused on three areas, immersing myself in the business, connecting with our buyers and our sellers throughout the world and meeting different teams across the organization. Throughout these engagements, I've been fortunate to observe, firsthand, the significant opportunity we have ahead of us.  Our purpose has always been to empower people and create economic opportunity for all, and there's never been a better time where this has mattered more than right now.  We're a globally recognized brand with a strong heritage, incredible assets and a talented and dedicated team who serve our passionate and loyal customer community. As we look into the future, we have a clear vision to build on these strengths and through a technology led reimagination of eBay, we'll become the best global marketplace to buy and sell.  Before I get into our vision for the future, I want to frame where we are in the context of today's market. Consumer behavior is rapidly evolving, and this dynamic has been accelerated by COVID-19, contributing to a significant volume acceleration and new customer acquisition. This led to a very strong quarter, coming in ahead of the recently increased expectations we shared in early June. Volume was strong across most major markets in the Marketplaces business, growing 29%, our highest quarterly growth rate in 15 years. We also added approximately 8 million more buyers to bring the annual active buyer base to 182 million. On behalf of our buyers, I want to thank our sellers for doing an amazing job selling and shipping over the past few months. Organic revenue was up 22% with strong Marketplaces volume offsetting an anticipated decline in Classifieds. Total margin rate was up five points to 34% and earnings per share was $1.08.  The current strength in demand creates a significant opportunity for us as we embark on the next phase, while also providing additional capacity for investment, which we're moving with pace to implement. In Q2, we were able to deploy incremental investments in the marketing and growth initiatives, while still delivering higher margins.  Operationally, our top initiative over the past two years, Managed Payments, just reached a very important milestone as we begin to scale globally. Although the original operating agreement reached the end of its term, PayPal will remain an important partner moving forward as a payment option for buyers. And from a seller perspective, after successful launches in the US and Germany over the past two years, we've started migrating sellers in the UK, Australia and Canada on payments. We expect to transition the majority of all sellers globally over the next 18 months and we remain on track to realize $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating profit in 2022. Managed payments is a great example of a tech-led reimagination of our marketplace. It provides a simpler and seamless experience for buyers and sellers around the world. Buyers can pay with ease and convenience with more choices of popular local payment methods. And, sellers benefit from a streamlined experience, more options on how and when to be paid, and the vast majority of sellers are saving money on fees. We've also recently concluded our portfolio review, leading to the pending transfer of the Classifieds business to Adevinta for approximately $9.2 billion. We are excited to bring together two highly complementary businesses in order to create the world's largest online classifieds group, with leading positions in 20 countries, covering 1 billion people around the world. With a strong partner in Adevinta, this structure allows us to dedicate our day-to-day focus on Marketplaces, provides immediate value for shareholders, and allows us to participate in the future growth of classifieds.  Against this encouraging backdrop, I'd like to share our long-term vision for eBay.  Put simply, our vision is to build on the company's powerful strengths to become the best global marketplace for buyers and sellers through a tech-led re-imagination of eBay. We've come a long way in our nearly 25 years, growing from our founder's first sale of a broken laser pointer into a global platform with more than 180 million buyers and tens of millions of sellers worldwide exchanging over $85 billion of goods. While there are many accomplishments to be proud of, we are not satisfied with where we currently stand. The reality is that in the past few years, we've not executed to our full potential. New competitors have taken share because we neglected our core area of expertise. We focused on new areas that did not drive sustainable or profitable growth. And, to be candid, we did not adapt quickly enough to the rapidly changing needs of our customers. This leaves us with enormous untapped potential that we absolutely must capitalize on. This is what brought me back to eBay and it's what the leadership team and I are committed to executing against. It will be a multiyear journey, but I believe we can drive long-term sustainable growth and generate significant value for shareholders. Our ambition to become the best global marketplace has been built with customers at the center, and an acknowledgment of the driving force of our success has always been and must continue to be our leadership in technology.  This is why the entire team at eBay is rallying around three key priorities to execute on the vision. One, to build compelling next gen experiences for our enthusiasts. Second, is become the partner of choice for our sellers and third is to cultivate lifelong trusted buyer relationships.  I will walk through each priority in more detail. Our first key priority is to defend the core business by building compelling next gen experiences for enthusiast customers. We will cater to them by focusing on two areas of historical strength: consumer selling and vertical experiences. Consumer sellers are dedicated eBay customers who have a proven track record of spending more than double the amount of buyers that don't sell on the platform. This group differentiates our global supply by bringing unique and compelling inventory at great value. We estimate that the average household in our major markets has approximately $4,000 worth of items to resell and is selling less than 20% of that online today. In addition to making extra money, by keeping products in circulation longer, customers are driving social and environmental benefits for all.  To lead in consumer selling, here are the areas where we intend to focus:  We will simplify the listing flow. It's currently too long and complicated and needs to be dramatically simplified. Next, we need to increase conversion to grow the number of consumer selling enthusiasts; and finally, we must make it easier for sellers to reinvest proceeds from their sales back in the things that they need, want and love on eBay.  One recent consumer selling launch streamlined the local pickup experience by leveraging QR scanning to complete in-person transactions. While we are pleased to see this tech-based simplification, there's a lot more to do to achieve the long-term objective of growing the number of consumer sellers on the platform. In terms of vertical experiences, we plan to focus on non-new-in-season products. Within these categories, we have unique inventory at scale, strong buyer consideration and loyal communities of buyers and sellers who connect through common interests and passions, not just to buy and sell merchandise.  This is an important focus for us as approximately half of our volume in major markets comes from these products. The TAM for these categories is expanding as more offline inventory transitions online. These categories span from luxury items to parts and accessories and motors to fashion, electronics, collectibles and more, and they represent the core of why people love eBay.  Our plan is to focus technology efforts on the evolving needs of these passionate enthusiasts, and we intend to accelerate growth in these categories in the coming years. The second key priority of our vision is to become the platform of choice for sellers. We will aim to inspire small businesses by introducing tools and features that compel them to start and grow their business on eBay. We will treat them like true partners by making the platform easier to use, grow their brand, drive their sales and carefully protect their reputation. By making eBay more compelling, we plan to grow the number of successful businesses on the platform. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses are already active today and tens of thousands have recently joined through programs like Up and Running across global markets.  Recently we launched several improvements to simplify registration and help sellers start and succeed on the platform. Additionally, we have boosted seller presence by launching store fronts in the mobile app and we will continue to iterate the Stores experience over time. Seller Hub tools continue to grow and in the past quarter, we launched several new features based on customer feedback. To name some improvements, we've started providing real-time competitive pricing and traffic data and also expanded multi-user authentication capabilities. Another great example is seller initiated offers, where sellers can send custom deals directly to buyers, which launched several new features in Q2 and is expected to drive over $1 billion in GMV in 2020. This demonstrates the power of the eBay platform where sellers can connect to individual buyers. To drive demand for sellers, we continue to augment Promoted Listings capabilities. In the second quarter, Promoted Listings delivered $196 million of revenue, up 124%. We see several growth levers including further promoted listings adoption, conversion improvements and ad product innovation designed to help sellers drive demand and grow their business. Finally, the third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong, trusted relationships with buyers. We plan to modernize and simplify the experience to drive more purchase frequency by leveraging AI teams to remove friction throughout the buying journey. In our highly rated app, we're delivering features that customers want. In June, we released dark mode on iOS and dark theme on Android, which was the most requested feature by customers, particularly our Gen Z customers. We also simplified search filtering on mobile, which is leading to an increase in sold items and better user efficiency. We've made significant incremental investments in three areas of marketing during Q2. First, we leaned into performance channels, which are delivering higher efficiency due to competitive spend reduction. Second, we incented more app downloads and adoption to improve buyer retention and third, we deployed a multichannel campaign to showcase sellers and continue to attract new small businesses. These SMBs bring great selection and value for buyers to discover.  We will continue to invest in the buyer experience and marketing technology capabilities as we work to foster lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. As we look forward, we have a clear vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay. This will be a multiyear process and will require investment but through a tech-led re-imagination, our plan is to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. And our key priorities to deliveries this vision are: to build compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts, to become the partner of choice for sellers and to cultivate lifelong trusted buyer relationships.  And while pursuing this vision, we will never lose sight of purpose, which is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all. It's that purpose that inspired the company and the eBay foundation to commit an additional $10 million in the second quarter to support COVID-19 relief efforts globally. Additionally, during the quarter we donated more than $1.3 million in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Equal Justice initiative in an effort to take action against systemic racism and injustice. With that, I'll turn the alter the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy? Yes, good to hear your voice Ed. So on the seller side, what we're really focused on is how do we make that initial process of coming on to the platform extremely easy. So simplifying the registration process, simplifying onboarding and simplifying getting up and running on the experience. And then as they progress and build their business on eBay, how do we give them more tools and capabilities to help them continue to grow that business on eBay. We talked about one, which is enhancing our stores product, bringing that into the native app. I'll be honest with you though, I think we have a lot more work to do in areas like that where we can make it even better and give them increased tools. And so that's going to be a huge focus for us on that second pillar of being the partner of choice for sellers. On the momentum, we feel great about the 8 million new buyers. It's been -- it's more than the last six quarters combined. And what we're really focused on is turning those buyers into enthusiasts and keeping them on the platform. So you saw us this quarter reinvest in areas like app downloads and convincing new buyers on the platform to get the app. That's where the majority of our transactions happen on the platform. And I talked about some of the innovations that we're doing there like the dark mode on the app which is exciting, but we're also working on revamping the whole onboarding process for buyers, so how they come in, their first 30 days.  And we've just started that this quarter to really take advantage of the new buyers. But that's part of the vision that we've laid out is really just enhancing that ability to bring buyers along on the journey and increase their lifetime value with us. But we're excited by what we're seeing, excited by the early momentum of what we're witnessing from those buyers. Yes, so I'll start and take the second one and then Andy maybe you can take the first one. So what I'd say on the demographics of the new buyers that we're bringing is it's really across the board and across all geographies. So all of our major market saw strong a buyer growth and it's really two fold. One, it's new buyers actually coming on to the platform and then it's also reactivating existing buyers or buyers that had a bit on the platform but hadn't purchased for us for a while. And then obviously a huge amount of growth with also just our existing buyers buying more. But what we're working on and you probably saw this in some of the TV advertising that we're doing and some of the digital is really appealing to the fact that small businesses are bringing unique inventory on to eBay and attracting buyers across the board. A key focus for us over the next couple years will be our GEN-Y customers. That's why we've made certain investments in our sneakers business and growing that and also why a feature like dark mode in mobile app also appears to younger demographic. So it will be a continued focus for us, Brian, over the next quarters and years. Andy, do you want to take the first one? Yes, so on the first one Doug, on the technology side, you're absolutely right. A huge focus for us. So first off, we have a really great world-class technology team in a lot of different geographies in the business. But we are focusing on augmenting that with even new capabilities. So we're building up our capabilities in AI and data science and computer vision. You may have seen features like easy image enhancing for our sellers. All that's coming out of kind of a next gen technology group that we've been building up. But it's a key focus for us because in that tech-led re-imagination, this company has been and always will be about how to create those game-changing technologies. To be candid though, there is also areas where we've got to get off of old legacy technologies. So part of it is just moving off of some of the older technology stack and modernizing that. The good news is that's in progress, but we're accelerating even that work. On the Classifieds deal, what I'd say is that we're really excited by the combination of the assets that our Classifieds business combined with Adevinta. When you look at the two of them together, it creates 20 leading markets in the classifieds business and creates the world's largest online classifieds business. So we're excited because it not only gives value to shareholders in the short term, but it allow us to participate in the long-term potential of this exciting new venture. And then the third thing that was important for us is now that we've divested StubHub and with his transfer of assets on Classifieds, it allows the whole management team, all of our technologists, the whole organization to focus on the Marketplace business. And then as you stated, in my remarks, I see a lot of untapped potential in that business. But there's also areas where we haven't kept pace. And so I think that focus will also be good for the whole organization. Yes, so great question. I'll start with the liquidity one. One of the benefits of the managed payments that we're launching and scaling here, we added several new countries and now we're able to really grow and ramp that with the changes a week ago with the expiration of the PayPal agreement. It is the exact ability to do what you're saying. So to make it easier for sellers and buyers to have their whole wallet and payments contained on the platform, it gives us more flexibility of things that we can do to really make that easy for them and so obviously transference is a huge benefit. The other thing I would say is that just getting buyers to sell, so just getting them to try it out, bring some inventory on, makes them a better buyer and it's because they've played on both sides of the marketplace. They've experienced the power of eBay. And so what we've seen is there a more than doubling of benefit to their buying behavior just like getting them to try selling. So we're really happy with that flywheel effect, it's something we're going to continue to lean into. As I've talked about the first pillar of consumer selling, that's the key piece of it. To your question on the inventory, we feel really beneficial because of the open and level playing field that we have. We can bring on that new consumer selling inventory, which is really valuable to have on the platform because it attracts a lot of buyers along with the SMB inventory that's there. And when I say we're focusing and getting back to non-new in-season it's not saying that you're not going to be able to buy a ton of new product, in-season product on eBay. We'll have that and always have that. But in terms of our focus, we think there is this massive opportunity, $500 billion in what eBay is fantastic and unique at. And we can build great fertile experiences. We can attract that supply. And that's where I believe there is just an enormous amount of untapped potential in going after it. And so really making sure that we nail everything about the buying experience end-to-end, having extreme customer focus will allows us to capture the potential. Yes, so look, what we're really focused on is how do we improve the overall experience between buyers and sellers and create a really healthy business in the long term. So I think the things that we've laid out lead us to a long-term healthy growth of the core Marketplace business. We're not going to quantify the long term what those numbers are, but I think the steps that we're going to take there will get us to a point where we're driving healthy growth. In terms of the capital allocation, we're going to stick really to the capital tenets that we've been talking about all along. And Andy, do you just want to reiterate what those are? Yes, so on the first question, it's two parts, it's one about where we're focusing our technology investments. And a key part of that is that I think for quite some time we were chasing a little bit the new in-season and not really focused on what's the core experience and how do we leverage technology in those key core verticals where eBay has an amazing stronghold and in the inventory in a non-new in-season where there is a over $500 billion opportunity. And so to be candid, I feel like there are certain areas we let niche competitors take business away from eBay that should be done on eBay and shows you the potential that we have on eBay, if we really focus our technology effort in those areas that we know are features, tools, capability and new experiences that help buyers and sellers connect. A small example of that is, while we don't have a huge pickup business and there's a lot of categories where people do meet in person to exchange goods. And we just made it more seamless through these QR codes for the buyer and the seller. It's kind of a magical experience, the money flows and that's the benefit of doing managed payments and technology together as we can create those experiences for buyers and sellers. On the managed payments side, what we're really focused on right now is scaling that business. So we've got a lot of work left to do in kind of opening up all of the remaining geographies, bringing more sellers on, etc. But once we do hit that point, yes, like we're talking about earlier, there's opportunities to do more and help connect, and make it more streamlined for sellers on the payments. We do have a buy now, pay later option, our monthly pay option. That's in partnership with PayPal. PayPal continues to be an option for how to pay on the platform and a key partner for us. But to answer your question, yes, we'll be continually looking at ways that we'll make buying and selling via payments easier, and managed payments gives us that flexibility. Yeah. Then what I'd say on the managed payment side is a couple of encouraging things. One is the feedback that we're getting from sellers, generally very positive. The vast majority of them will see lower fees and have a simpler fee structure with the result of rolling it out. And a lot of them have signed up, pre-registered, so waiting for when we can open up the platform which we did two weeks ago. And I would say the same thing on the buyer side, especially for a new buyer, creates a lot less friction. And so we are excited and optimistic for what that means for the overall experience. And when I talk about a tech-led re-imagination, payments is the perfect example. It just makes the whole experience easier and better. We committed to it and put a lot of resources behind making it a great experience. And so far that's the feedback that we've been getting by both buyers and sellers. Yeah. So our incentive structure really hasn't changed over the years and it's based on a combination of top and bottom line. On the M&A opportunities and the acceleration, the focus, what I'd say has changed is the whole organization is now really focused on the vision that I have outlined. Now that without StubHub and now with Classifieds transferred to Adevinta, you've got the whole organization thinking about this overall tech-led reimagination from technology, marketing, product and these three kind of key focus areas. And so, yeah, we will look at opportunistic M&A where we think we can really help accelerate that focus on the core business. But like I said before, we see a huge amount of untapped potential just in going after these key experiences in key verticals of getting back to that kind of core C2C selling. And moving this idea I think for some years, we were acquiring buyers at all costs and really focusing on how do we turn buyers into lifelong trusted relationships and putting all of our efforts across product, marketing, technology, etc., around that focus. And I think it's that focus and that lean-in on the technology side in a big way, that's going to allow us to capture it. Yeah. So look this quarter, on the marketing side -- Heath, a great question. On the marketing side, we were able to lean in pretty well to the new buyers that we are acquiring. So both with kind of brand advertising talking about the small businesses, but also in a less competitive environment on the performance side of the business. When I talk about marketing, it's not just the spend, but it's also just our CRM programs, how we communicate, how we leverage things like email notifications, etc. And I think that we've built some good capabilities over the years, but I think we have a massive opportunity there to help buyers get up the lifecycle in an even better way. So that will also be an opportunity that we're really focused on. On the channel mix, we have the benefit of obviously, having lots of different channels for driving it. I would say the newest ones that we're really focused on are acquiring the Gen Y customers and looking at new opportunities in paid social and going after and making sure that customer is attracted. I talked to kind of really understanding the categories that attract that demographic on the platform. And so, I think you'll see slight shifts in terms of the marketing mix that we're looking at. But overall, we tend to leverage all the channels that we have to maximize the ROI that we can get off of that spend. And as I talked about, we're really focused on how do we get not just a new buyer onto the platform, but how we turn that new buyer into an enthusiast. And that's where I think the real unlock and the power of the model lies."

I'd like to turn the call over to Scott to begin the earnings update and I look forward to speaking with you again 90 days from now. Scott?\nScott Schenkel: Thanks, Jamie. Good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to the year ahead of our expectations. Our volume is accelerating, managed payments and ads are delivering growth and are on track for long-term success. We are executing our product road map, improving buyer and seller experience and conversion, and we are driving margin expansion. We closed the StubHub deal in February, quickly deployed proceeds to reward shareholders, made progress on the Classifieds portfolio, and strengthened our balance sheet. While executing on our Q1 priorities, COVID-19 dramatically changed the world. Individuals and families are sheltering in place, millions of people have lost their jobs, and communities are struggling. Our purpose has always been to empower people and create economic opportunity for all. We are fortunate to have a resilient business that can help in times like these. That purpose and resiliency have inspired us to deploy well over $100 million to support our employees, communities, customers around the world at a time when they need it most, positioning our stakeholders to exit this crisis stronger. The health and safety of our employees and their communities is our top priority and I want to thank our team for their remarkable dedication during this difficult time. In line with government guidelines, we shifted the vast majority of our team to work from home, many for the first time, including thousands of customer service team members around the world. We provided them with equipment, training, and resources to support their transition. We also financially protected our hourly and alternative workforces, ensuring they get paid while society is asking them to do their part. We have also empowered our leaders to provide employees flexibility to balance health, well being, family, and professional responsibilities. We are also investing millions of dollars into our communities. Through eBay for Charity, we are matching contributions made by U.S. customers to Feeding America, Direct Relief and the Opportunity Fund. In the U.S. buyers can also purchase gifts that give back to support relief efforts and in the U.K. buyers can donate at checkout to support NHS Charities Together. Through the eBay Foundation, we have funded several non-profit organizations supporting small businesses and community relief efforts around the world, including Silicon Valley Strong in our home city of San Jose. During this crisis, the eBay Marketplace has remained open for everyone, granting buyers access to a wide selection of global inventory and aggregating growing demand for sellers. For hundreds of thousands of small businesses worldwide, we offered to defer fees, provided store subscribers with more free listings, and protected seller performance standards. We are also supporting small brick and mortar retailers by offering free listings and free store subscriptions for first time sellers along with mentors to help get them started. Thousands of new sellers have signed up across our global markets further expanding the strength of our supply. In addition to investing in small businesses, we are partnering with government officials on a local, state, national, and international level to prevent price gouging, stop false health claims, and prevent illegal products from being sold. To ensure that our platform remains safe and trusted, we have blocked or removed more than 15 million listings to date from our global Marketplace that violate COVID-19 policies. We are also advocating on behalf of small businesses with legislators through a grassroots advocacy program to ensure they benefit from important economic relief decisions and programs. In our Classifieds Motors verticals, many dealers were forced to close their business temporarily and we provided them with immediate help by waiving fees and extending payment terms. We also added new ways in our experience for customers to connect directly with dealers to drive leads. On our horizontal Classifieds platforms, we rapidly adapted our product experiences by educating users how to trade safely and by launching a neighborhood assistance category that connects customers confined to their home to those who want to help. These efforts have improved vibrancy while protecting our supply and demand in the near-term. While some of these actions impacted Q1 and create short-term financial headwinds, our Classifieds platforms are positioned to exit stronger when businesses reopen as we are starting to see in Germany. While supporting our customers and employees, we over-delivered for our shareholders on our Q1 commitments. Before the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 started impacting our business in late Q1, our key metrics were performing better than our expectations through the first 11 weeks. The roll out of new and expanded experiences for buyers and sellers along with the acceleration in managed payments and ads were driving improvement in GMV and revenue despite the continued headwinds from Internet sales tax and reductions in marketing spend that skewed towards the U.S. Since then, COVID-19 impacted our major markets as shelter-in-place actions were required and we saw an immediate change in the growth trajectory. In Marketplace, there was an initial surge in home confinement categories in late March, which then expanded in April across all verticals including parts and accessories, fashion and more. Since the start of April, GMV has been growing over 20% in our major on-platform markets every week. Andy will go into further detail about recent trends in his remarks. In total for Q1, volume was flat compared to a year ago, a 4 point improvement versus Q4 with U.S. volume 5 points better and international volume 4 points better. Organic revenue was up 2%, above the high-end of our guidance. Margins were strong at 31.5% driven by operational cost savings that helped fund managed payments as well as incremental investments and expenses related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 19%, substantially better than expected. In addition, we closed the StubHub deal in February, expanded our 2020 share buyback plan to $4.5 billion, paid our dividend as planned, and strengthened our capital structure. Independent of COVID-19 effects, we made progress on our key priorities in the first quarter. Our underlying operating plans remain the same as we communicated in January, which were to deliver our growth initiatives of managed payments and ads, provide more seller tools, improve buyer experiences, and leverage our structured data foundation while delivering margin expansion. Our growth initiatives continue to stay on track and are making meaningful contributions to our results, a testimony to our employees and partners working from home around the world and to our leadership team's tenacity. The managed payments transition continues to gain momentum. Buyers are getting more choice and a seamless checkout while sellers are saving money on a simpler experience that offers quick and flexible ways to get paid. Since launch, we have processed more than $3 billion of GMV for over 32,000 sellers on our payment rails while saving them millions in fees. U.S. volume remains at the limit permitted under the operating agreement, while in Germany we ramped from 3% in December to 6% in March on our way to 10% by mid-year. We recently announced to sellers in the U.K., Australia, and Canada that their transitions will begin in July. Many are already pre-registered and we encourage sellers to visit our Seller Center for more information on how we can accelerate their ability to save money and simplify their eBay experience. We are confident in our plan to transition the vast majority of sellers starting in July through the end of 2021 as managed payments will become the only way to buy and sell on eBay. We remain on track to realizing an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in 2022. As a reminder, these economics do not include any benefits from improved experience or reduced friction for buyers and sellers. Advertising continues to drive revenue growth and had a strong start to the year. In Q1, Promoted Listings delivered $137 million of revenue, up 111%. Nearly 1.2 million sellers promoted more than 310 million listings in the quarter. Sellers continue to adopt Promoted Listings to drive conversion while buyers are seeing a better eBay experience with fewer third-party ads. Although third-party ad revenue continues to decline, our overall advertising revenues grew more than 25% for the quarter. In Q1, we raised performance standards for all sellers which modestly reduced the number of Promoted Listings, but yielded improved conversion. We remain on track with our plan to deliver $800 million in total ad revenue this year on our way to building $1 billion advertising business in the next couple of years. In our on-platform marketplace business, we continue to invest and expand in seller tools and capabilities. Seller initiated offers allow a seller to offer lower prices to individual buyers to drive conversion. In Q1, this scaled to over 1.5 million offers per day, driven by increased adoption in item eligibility. We also rolled out an image quality tool, which is helping sellers improve photos on their listings. The majority of the sellers that have used the tool have enhanced their images contributing to a more consistent looking buyer experience. We expect this to lead to better conversion over time. Multi-user authentication capabilities are helping small business teams manage their business securely and these features have extended globally and integrated with order management and price guidance tools. On the buyer experience, we saw an increased conversion through improvements in search that were enabled by growth in structured data. Based on behavioral data, our algorithms recommend to sellers which information can maximize the velocity of their listings as sellers add more structured data in the form of aspects, their listings are increasingly showing up in filtered search results. This leads to higher conversion as buyers are more likely to discover and purchase their items. We also raised the limit of saved searches for hundreds of thousands of highly engaged loyal buyers who reached the previous cap of 100 searches, allowing them to expand their shopping on eBay. Millions of buyers are tracking their shipments on our platform and we are sending notifications to alert them of early or late deliveries. Our overall delivery performance has held up well during the COVID-19 crisis as our supply base does not have large single points of failure nor are their fulfillment constraints for essential or non-essential items on eBay. With the disruption to exports from China during the quarter, our speed pack efforts combined with our existing domestic sellers supply allowed for strong inventory availability and delivery performance. While executing these and other improvements for buyers and sellers in our product experiences, we also delivered on margin expansion. We realized efficiencies in our marketing spend and reduced operating costs in a number of areas. The cost to scale managed payments are in line with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver at least 2 points of incremental margin by 2022. In Q1, our international on and off platform businesses had similar volume dynamics. In Korea, our underlying volume growth rate was consistent with Q4, but total volume accelerated modestly from upside in essential categories due to COVID-19. Revenues grew at double-digit rate due to the ongoing expansion of our first-party inventory program. Despite significant marketing by competitors that is likely deeply negative ROI, we have a leading position in Korea with double-digit growth, first-party FMCG capabilities, and significant scale. Margin dynamics are well above most peers in the market although margin contribution is significantly less than our on-platform markets in the rest of the world due to marketing spend differences and the first-party sales mix. Aside from ongoing business results, I would like to take a step back from recent performance to address the ongoing portfolio review of our Classifieds business. As we previously stated, we are in active discussions with multiple parties exploring value creating alternatives. We remain committed to maximizing value for shareholders and will provide an update by our Q2 earnings call in the middle of the year. Despite the short-term disruption to the industry presented by COVID-19, the long-term prospects for Classifieds are strong. We believe that the recovery period will create more growth opportunities for our platform. As a frame of reference, following the '08, '09 financial crisis, used car sales outpaced new car sales for several years and the shift from offline to online advertising accelerated. Those two macro dynamics provided tailwinds and rewarded players with strong demand and supply and we believe our Motors verticals and ad-based horizontal platforms are well positioned to perform strongly in that environment. Over the past several months, we have driven significant changes to position the business for sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Underlying volume is improving and consumer demand during shelter-in-place has surged. We've approached this pandemic striving to support our employees, communities, and customers and exit this global crisis stronger. We continue executing on our growth initiatives, delivering product experience improvements, improving margins, and over-delivering on our financial commitments. Looking ahead, with a distributed and scalable seller base, a strong balance sheet and cash flows, low capital intensity, and disciplined management, we have the strength and flexibility to adapt to this economic environment. Personally, I'm grateful for the opportunity to lead this team and business over the past several months, not to mention my time as CFO in the eight years before that. I remain excited for eBay's future prospects and look forward to my next chapter. Now let me turn it over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Mr. Cring?\nAndy Cring: Thanks, Scott. Before we dive into financial highlights and the earnings presentation, I will begin my prepared remarks with a few comments on the impacts we are seeing related to COVID-19. These are unprecedented times and we are working hard to support our employees who in turn are working at home around the world to support our communities, customers, and shareholders. We believe our culture shines in these moments and our robust business model and strong balance sheet and cash flow provide the backstop that enables us to withstand these disruptions and directly support all of our stakeholders. In Q1, before we felt the full global impact of COVID-19, our underlying business performance was better than our expectations. Through mid-March, volume was accelerating compared to Q4 and we were tracking above the high-end of our revenue and earnings guidance range. Late in March, our segments began to see a more pronounced impact of the global pandemic. Our marketplace volume further accelerated as our sellers stepped up to serve the increasing needs of buyers around the world. However, in Classifieds, advertising came under significant pressure. Overall, while the revenue impact of COVID-19 in Q1 was relatively muted at the Inc. level, we did experience roughly 2 points of margin pressure driven in part by implementing programs to support our customers. In April, we have seen a surge in buyer demand resulting in double-digit Marketplace volume growth while Classifieds revenue has further decelerated based on continued advertising pressure coupled with the actions we've taken to support our Motors dealers. More specifically, here is a little more color on how the progressive impact of COVID-19 has been felt by our customers, how we've responded, and how that shows up in our results. First, as stay-at-home mandates rolled out across geographies, advertisers began pulling spend, negatively impacting third-party advertising revenue in both Classifieds and Marketplace. Second, as automotive dealers around the world were forced to close their doors to comply with local stay-at-home mandates, we acted quickly to protect our customers by eliminating subscription fees while these dealers are closed. Third, we took several additional steps across both segments to assist customers in this critical time. Some of these actions such as extending payment terms resulted in adjustments to bad debt and other reserves that are having a short-term impact on operating margins across our business. Fourth, in the last two weeks of March, we saw even more volume acceleration in Marketplace as buyers, traffic, conversion, sold items, GMV, and revenue growth all improved. In March and the first part of April, the strength was driven by confinement categories as buyers were focused on products for home offices, gym equipment, and indoor leisure activities like video games and consoles. More recently, we've seen a lift in other categories such as parts and accessories and fashion as buyers started expanding their online shopping. The growth has been broad-based and global in nature. In summary, thus far in Q2, Marketplace growth has significantly accelerated compared with Q1 with Classifieds seeing near-term pressure. The net impact of this is favorable in total. While some of the actions we've taken put short-term pressure on our financial performance, it's clear that taking care of our sellers who need some extra help during this time is the right thing to do for them and will make us an even stronger company over the longer-term. You can see examples of our actions that we've taken for our stakeholders on Slide 3 of the earnings presentation. In this rapidly changing environment, it's unclear how long these dynamics will last. I'll discuss how they influence our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year in our guidance section. Turning to Slide 5, in Q1, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, up 2% on an organic FX-neutral basis, above the high-end of our guide. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 19%. Non-GAAP margins were strong at 31.5%, inclusive of ongoing investments in managed payment and the incremental investments and expenses related to COVID-19. We generated $702 million of operating cash and $604 million of free cash flow. In addition, we closed on the sale of StubHub for $4.1 billion in cash, subject to working capital adjustments and net proceeds of $3.2 billion. In Q1, we returned $4.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on Slide 6, we have 174 million buyers representing 2% year-on-year growth, flat with Q4. Coming into Q1, we expected and saw modest buyer growth deceleration driven in part by our planned reduction of marketing spend on buyers with lower engagement and higher churn. This was completely offset by buyer acceleration in March as more buyers came to eBay for their shopping needs as stay-at-home mandates were put in place around the world. Moving to Slide 7, in Q1, we enabled $21.3 billion of Marketplace GMV, flat year-on-year and accelerating 4 points versus the prior quarter. We estimate that COVID-19 drove approximately 2 points of volume acceleration for the quarter, mostly in the second half of March. In the U.S., we generated $7.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year and accelerating five points from Q4. The year-on-year growth figure includes a 6 point headwind from the continued impact of the Internet sales tax across the U.S., in line with our expectations and approximately the same as Q4. Please refer to the appendix to see the impact of Internet sales tax over time. The 5 point acceleration versus Q4 is driven by approximately 2 points of upside from COVID-19, approximately 2 points from increased marketing efficiency and product experience improvements, and 1 point from the impact of leap year. International GMV was up 3%, accelerating 4 points versus Q4, driven by the same factors I mentioned for the U.S. Moving to revenue on Slide 8, for the company, we generated net revenues of $2.4 billion, up 2% organically, accelerating 1 point from Q4. We delivered $1.9 billion of transaction revenue, up 3% and $474 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 8%, inclusive of a 6 point headwind from the sale of brands4friends. The net impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was minimal overall with Marketplace volume driven upside offset by Classifieds downside. Turning to Slide 9, our Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 1%, accelerating 2 points from the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 3%, a 2 point acceleration versus Q4 driven by GMV and Promoted Listings, partly offset by increased credit reserves related to COVID-19. Marketing services and other revenue was down 15%, accelerating two points versus the fourth quarter. The year-on-year decline is driven by 12 points from the sale of brands4friends in addition to COVID-19 pressure on third-party ads, partially offset by six points of growth in our Korea first-party business, which grew over 60% year-on-year. Marketplace segment margin was 36%, flat year-on-year as the benefit of reduced marketing, the sale of brands4friends, and continued cost discipline were offset by our investment in managed payments and the impact of COVID-19 related impacts I mentioned earlier. Moving to Slide 10. In Q1, Classifieds revenue was flat year-on-year decelerating six points versus Q4 driven by continued headwinds in horizontal display advertising across markets in addition to COVID-19 related pressure. Segment margin for Classifieds was 33%, down three points year-on-year, driven primarily by increased reserves related to COVID-19 as we extended payment terms across markets and continued investment in verticals, which pressured margin in a period of lower revenue growth. Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. This is roughly flat year-on-year as reduced operating expenses, operating cost, and the impact of divesting brands4friends were offset by increased reserves related to COVID-19, our investment in managed payments, and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Cost of revenue is down 20 basis points year-on-year as a percentage of revenue driven by the divestiture of brands4friends, partially offset by scaling managed payments and are expanding first-party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over 1 point versus the prior year primarily driven by reductions in marketing and promotional spend in our U.S. business, partially offset by increasing year-over-year investments in our international Marketplace business including off-platform, which is comprised of our higher growth businesses in Korea, Japan, and Turkey. Product development costs were up 10 basis points from investments in managed payments and Classifieds to expand our Motors vertical offerings. G&A was down 20 basis points driven by operational efficiency, partially offset by our continued investment in managed payments. We've added a view on transaction losses given the significant investments made in Q1. Transaction losses have grown approximately 150 basis points due to deferred fees and seller protection increases driven by COVID-19 that impact our bad debt and eBay Money Back Guarantee reserves. Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus the prior year, our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-GAAP EPS expansion. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by our share repurchase program, revenue growth, and our improved cost structure partially offset by our investment in managed payments and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 12% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by our share repurchase program, partially offset by lapping a higher gain associated with the Adyen warrant. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to Slide 13. In Q1, we generated $604 million of free cash flow, up 54% driven by higher earnings and the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. Moving to Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments inclusive of the $4.1 billion we received for the sale of StubHub business and debt of $8.7 billion. For the quarter, we distributed $4 billion in the form of share buybacks and repurchased nearly 98 million shares, inclusive of an accelerated share repurchase plan that will be completed later this year. We have approximately $0.5 billion in share buyback remaining to hit the $4.5 billion we guided to in February. At this time, our expectation is that we will execute on that share buyback before the end of the year, but that will depend on market dynamics in the second half. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining and we paid $114 million in dividends. We also took two steps to further improve our liquidity position. We acquired $1 billion of debt at favorable rates that we intend to use to repay our 2020 maturities that come due in June and October. We also renewed our $2 billion credit revolver to retain financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15, our capital allocation strategy and key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our BBB+ credit rating, mid-term leverage of approximately 1.5 times net debt and gross debt below 3 times EBITDA and a year-end cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Turning to Slide 16 and Q2 guidance. For the second quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.38 billion and $2.48 billion, growing 2% to 6% on an organic FX-neutral basis. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect Marketplace revenue and volume to grow in the high-single digits year-on-year. In Classifieds, we expect significant revenue pressure contracting between 30% and 40% year-on-year, which equates to approximately 5 points of pressure at the total company level driven by temporarily waiving fees, mostly in April, and lower advertising revenue. For Marketplace, this assumes that double-digit growth in April trends back to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the quarter. If volume strength continues at a higher pace than this assumption, we expect to be at the high-end or above this range. For Classifieds, this assumes the automotive subscription revenue largely recovers in May with dealers re-opening across our markets. It also assumes a modest level of recovery in advertising. While it's difficult to predict how long these market dynamics will continue, as Scott mentioned, we feel great about the long-term prospects for this business. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.80 per share, representing 10% to 21% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by the combined benefit of the lower share count, Marketplace volume, and cost control, partially offset by lower Classifieds revenue and investments in managed payments. In addition, approximately 9 points of headwind come from a stronger U.S. dollar, a higher non-GAAP tax rate, and less interest income based on lower cash balances. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 per share to $0.57 per share in Q2. Turning to Slide 17, given this dynamic environment, we are not revising our full-year revenue, margin, and EPS estimates, but we wanted to provide you with a little bit more context on how we are thinking about the rest of the year. First, excluding the impact of COVID-19, our underlying Marketplace business is performing in line to slightly better than our expectation across several measures. Yet, we are managing through a dynamic environment with uncertainty on potential disruptions that could impact consumer buying behavior. This creates a wide range of potential outcomes for the year. The dynamics that could pressure the low-end of our guidance range would include Marketplace volume regressing to levels below what we're experiencing in early Q1 driven by consumer spending weakness and/or further macroeconomic dislocation. If Classifieds revenue showed improvement but we face continued disruption in the automotive verticals and/or slower prolonged recovery in advertising. The dynamics that would put us toward the higher-end or above our full-year range would include; marketplace volumes stronger than our original second half plan driven by more permanent offline to online shopping shift and our ability to effectively retain the new buyers and sellers; and if Classifieds revenue improves more quickly returning to growth in the second half, but below pre-COVID-19 levels. We expect that margin rates could have increased variability in the coming quarters, given some of the revenue and macroeconomic dynamics, but our cost discipline remains strong and we're committed to our long-term margin structure previously communicated of 2 points of expansion by 2022. It's also a volatile time for currency and given the global nature of our business, significant movements can have a material impact on our results. If current rates hold, we would have revenue pressure of approximately $100 million and $0.04 of EPS compared to our February guide. We now expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This increase of $1 billion versus our February guidance is based solely on the expectation that the cash tax payments related to the sale of StubHub will be recorded in discontinued operations. We have a strong balance sheet, our liquidity is in great shape and our business models continues to generate strong free cash flow in any of the above scenarios. In closing, these are challenging times for everyone. We remain focused on our employees, communities, and customers while continuing to deliver for our investors. Our key growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising are on track. We continue to fight through the lingering impacts of lower marketing spend and Internet sales tax and we'll exit the year stronger than we entered on these fronts. Above all, we will continue to focus on the safety of our stakeholders and on returning the Marketplace business to sustainable long-term growth by providing a trusted platform for buyers and sellers to transact around the world. And now, Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions, operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thanks guys. So I guess a question on payments and I guess a question on the buyers. We're only a few months away from the end of the agreement with PayPal. So just wanted to check in with you guys on how your comfort levels with your own payment rails has evolved as you test in more regions and I guess as a byproduct, your willingness to either speed up or slow down the transition and I guess on the buyer side, the fear here is that as the world goes back to some normalcy, the people who came back to engage and buy more from eBay will just simply go away. So what do you think you can do to hold on to this increased level of activity? Thanks.\nScott Schenkel: So, Stephen, on payments, look, I think our comfort level remains very strong. The team is executing well. We have two markets up and running, three now announced as we just went through. We're pre-onboarding customers on to rails that have been working. We continue to get great feedback from sellers and continue to expand and so our focus is going fast and letting our sellers really get the benefit of a simpler experience that's less expensive and a better experience integrated into their selling account and the buyers having more options and so we feel good about it. On the buyers back to normal, Andy, you want to take that one?\nAndy Cring: Yeah, look, Stephen, I think the way we think about it is we've been working for a long time to improve the buyer experience across the site and we have an opportunity here with some pretty healthy buyer growth at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter to further leverage that. We're going to continue to invest in these buyers to ensure that they are finding and realizing the value and selection that we offer and continuing to drive engagement with these customers is critical. It's super early in the process. New buyers typically will engage a little less frequency and buy a little less than retained buyers and we're seeing similar behaviors, but one of our key focus is in the coming weeks and months is going to be how do we work to drive increased engagement with the buyer growth that we've had recently.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, just a follow-up on the sustainability of the GMV. So I think you said up 20% every week in April and it seems like advertising rates around the Internet are coming down, do you view this as an opportunity where you could potentially lean in on SEM or on other forms of kind of customer acquisition to not only try to hang on to the new buyers that you've got but drive more new buyers even after the quarantine's end. Any color there? And then the second question is just an update on the portfolio review. Any update on ECG given what's going on in the world and what's going on in terms of the deceleration in that business. Any new plan around the sale process and then has your thinking around Korea -- that business and the strength that you're seeing in Korea change at all. Any thoughts on where that one stands as far as the strategic review process? Thank you.\nScott Schenkel: Yeah, maybe a few points and then Andy jump in. So the sustainability of 20% I think what we're calling out in our guide is that we expect it to trend back down, although it's obviously very hard to tell. The benefit that we've seen is first is as I called out and then Andy emphasized, we've had a really good out of the gate kind of what we term confinement categories and broadly speaking, those categories would cover roughly 25% of the site and that started to accelerate and then what you saw is as that settled down and as that matured, you started to see buyers buying in all of the other categories. And so, what you see now is a broad-based expansion of the growth in other categories on eBay without really any being left behind per se and so from that perspective, it feels good. I think to the spirit of your question, we will continue to be spending. The nice part is these new buyers fit right into our strategy of going after the buyers we brought in the last 12 to 24 months. We're trying to activate them and so they'll go right into those cohorts and really we'll be working on things like getting them to sign up for the mobile app if they didn't come through the mobile app, getting them to fully register as a user, if they were only a guest, continuing to hammer them with emails and other value that's available on the site. So tons of opportunities there. I don't know, Andy, do you want to weigh in on the ad rate or anything else I left out on that?\nAndy Cring: Well, I'll maybe double click a little bit on the GMV comment and the sustainability of it. Just you know clearly in the guide for the quarter and the year, we're not counting on those rates of growth continuing. We haven't seen anything through April to suggest that they don't. So to the extent that they would continue at or not trend down as quickly, we'd see some upside, but to Scott's point looking to engage and take advantage of the incremental buyers we have and leverage them through the process.\nScott Schenkel: Yeah, and then hey Ross, to get back to the other parts of your 14 point question here, let me try on Classifieds, the Classifieds, look, I think, certainly we have got the pressure from ads. I don't anticipate once dealerships come back, that we'll have ongoing pressure from that. And so the dynamic as we look towards the second half of the year and certainly for the longer-term, we don't feel it impacts the valuation of the company and thus accordingly, we're not really looking at the portfolio, discussions that aren't going any differently than we were three to six months ago and so we are in active conversations with multiple parties as I called out and we'll give you an update by the Q2 earnings call. And then Korea, sorry, Korea -- look, Korea is a great platform and we elaborated a bit more at least in my script on a bit more of the dynamics around what we're seeing there and you know, good double-digit revenue growth in that business this quarter, a little bit of highlight of the contribution operating income dynamics that we get out of that business versus some of the others and I think as we've demonstrated along the way and the Board has demonstrated, we'll continue to be clinical about how we approach all of our portfolio around eBay. Right now we're focused on Classifieds and making sure we maximize value for shareholders in that transaction. Did I get them all there?\nRoss Sandler: Yeah, I'll get back in the queue with a few more. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. With the buyer growth being the same that we saw in Q4, is there any way you could sort of tease out what might have been sort of a tale of two parts of the quarter in terms of active buyer growth because I think anecdotally most people would assume that as people were re-engaging with the platform and you saw a type of better post-COVID behavior on the platform by buyers and sellers that, that number probably would have been a little bit better. So I didn't know if we could drill down a little bit on that number and maybe some of the rate of change you saw on it as the quarter progressed and maybe even out into Q1. That would be number one. Number two, coming into this year, there was a lot of talk about the headwinds that were going to be created by the Internet sales tax initiatives. We're not talking about that now, so is that either remaining a headwind, but one that you're outrunning because of the demand environment changes that have persisted or is that sort of the headwind that still persists to the same degree you thought before, but you're either outrunning it or it doesn't matter to buyers to the same degree that it did before. Just curious what the dynamic around IST might be. Thank you.\nAndy Cring: Yeah. Hey, Eric. It's Andy, I'll take both of those. Like I think both -- Scott and I both said in our script, the beginning part of this quarter was performing as we expected on almost all fronts and buyers are no different. As we said, you know, most of last year, we've been shifting marketing expense away trying to drive an increased CLV with buyers and we expected to see some deceleration in the first quarter and we were seeing it and we've seen healthy buyer growth the last couple of weeks of March. So absent the lift in COVID, I think that you'd probably be looking at slightly lower buyer growth, but keep in mind that's a trailing 12-month measure and it's really hard to move that in a period of two weeks. So, as -- we'll I'm sure disclose much more as we get through the second quarter on the growth rates, but you can assume with 20% GMV growth that we've had some pretty healthy buyer growth as well. The second question on IST, look, I think part of the reason we're talking less about it is its just relative to everything else going on, it's a smaller issue. Fundamentally, nothing's changed other than it's performing basically exactly as we thought it would. When we entered the year, we had I think two states we lapped on January 1st. The thesis at the time in what we're seeing in early January was that we would lap out of the headwind as states reached the 12-month mark. We had a few weeks of data at the time and we said that that's what we saw. We now have four states that have lapped out and we're seeing consistent data across all those states. So we remain confident that we'll see lift half over half driven by IST as that headwind dissipates, but the reality is we had in the U.S., 6 points of headwind in the fourth quarter. We thought first quarter would be roughly 6 points, we think it was still roughly 6 points in the first quarter. So kind of to our expectations on that front.\nEric Sheridan: Okay, great guys, thanks so much for the color and stay well, speak soon.\nOperator: Your next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: Great thanks. Andy, we've talked a lot about buyers and buyer growth. I wonder if you give us a sense of kind of what you're seeing on the supply side of the equation. Obviously, it's really early in this whole environment that we're in right now, but in prior recessions, we've seen pretty big spikes in supply on the platform and that's impacted pricing. Any sense as to whether you're seeing growth in supply on the platform, the old narrative being people cleaning out their closets, cleaning out their attic as they have more time in their homes and are able to -- looking for sort of additional income. Are we seeing that -- have we entered that wave on the platform yet and if so, or if it's something that you do expect, how do you see it impacting GMV growth as you think about us getting deeper into the recession. And then just strategically, I realize it's sort of early to kind of ask this question as well as you sort of think about your time is -- how you're going to manage the company as CEO, but the company has leaned really hard on capital returns in the past. As you think about sort of how you want to manage eBay, how do you anticipate sort of investing for growth, investing in technology, investing in the things that are going to allow you to compete against everyone else that's in e-commerce versus continuing down the path of returning capital to shareholders?\nAndy Cring: Okay, Heath, thanks. I'll take the first one. I think Scott will handle the second one. I'll try to give a little more color and you hinted at it at the beginning of your statement that it's super early and it's unclear how any of these things will really mature over time, but a couple of things that we did see. Early on, C2C was not really partaking in the growth that we saw relative to second half of March and we think that's related a little bit to the fact that to your people were moving around maybe less likely to go to the post office or deliver things and we've seen that recover a bit as we've gotten into April. In terms of supply, the listings on the site are healthy despite the fact that we've had the relatively quick ramp and spike in volume so that we haven't seen a reduction in listings on the site. In fact, I think they've grown a bit through April to support the volume spike that we're seeing on the B2C side. So we feel like supply is healthy. We've been onboarding as Scott mentioned and I mentioned onboarding new sellers through this process as well. So feel good about supply.\nScott Schenkel: Yeah, you know, the other thing I'd add to that Heath is what we saw in January and February in particular when China was more shut down, we saw a dynamic that we've kind of confirmed and what we saw was just the strength in the overall global ecosystem of seller and listing and inventory availability, which was even as China was restricted, we saw domestic sellers step-up with additional inventory in the different markets where we have the buy side. So obviously, we don't have a buy side of China to speak of, it's super small. So the corridor out of China as that got a bit restricted in January and February in particular, we saw the other seller step-up and really not miss a beat and so just the quality of the sellers in the global supply chain was quite profound and so we saw tons of benefit there as kind of supply shifted around. As other markets -- Western markets started to shelter-in-place, China came back online and quickly really with a lot of help from our seller team in China, helped get them back online and shipping using our speed pack capabilities, which give them the capability to get inventory into other markets very quickly and so that was terrific. So I think broadly speaking, we walked away from the last six, seven weeks or even last quarter feeling very good about the supply quality. And to your question on C2C, I think it's a bit early to really see any substantial strength from C2C, but I would expect that as we go forward and certainly what people have already started to see in our international markets in particular is additional messaging to C2C sellers to re-engage with the platform if they haven't been around recently. So that'll be -- you'll see that in most major markets. On the question for -- I think that's Jamie, just in the interest of time, we'll park that and we'll let Jamie come back to that when we get to July.\nJoe Billante: Operator, I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. I'll make it quick. You've got some pretty good success with your sponsored listings product. I think your target was $1 billion in total marketing. Any change in your thinking there. Do you think it could be higher than say 1% to 1.5% of GMV and any signs that make you think the opportunity could be bigger over time? Thank you.\nScott Schenkel: Well, a couple of things that I think we saw in Q1 that we feel great about. First off, while we raised the level of what was required for sellers to participate in Promoted Listings, we saw better quality listings go into search results and other placements that had better conversion and I think you've heard me talk about a number of times that the trick here to get to $1 billion and then north of there is making sure that this is accretive to the user experience and not a distraction, not sending people elsewhere and I think we walk away from Q1 feeling great about that. We'll work on the $1 billion first and then we'll update you after that, but look, I think the team has done an excellent job and what you're going to see us continue to do is iterate on placements, pricing, all sorts of things to just make this accretive to the user experience and I don't think the team sees any limits to this and they're really focused on it that way. Thanks.\nJustin Post: Thank you.\nJoe Billante: Operator, I think that's all the time we've got for questions today.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJoe Billante: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andy Cring",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Before we dive into financial highlights and the earnings presentation, I will begin my prepared remarks with a few comments on the impacts we are seeing related to COVID-19. These are unprecedented times and we are working hard to support our employees who in turn are working at home around the world to support our communities, customers, and shareholders. We believe our culture shines in these moments and our robust business model and strong balance sheet and cash flow provide the backstop that enables us to withstand these disruptions and directly support all of our stakeholders. In Q1, before we felt the full global impact of COVID-19, our underlying business performance was better than our expectations. Through mid-March, volume was accelerating compared to Q4 and we were tracking above the high-end of our revenue and earnings guidance range. Late in March, our segments began to see a more pronounced impact of the global pandemic. Our marketplace volume further accelerated as our sellers stepped up to serve the increasing needs of buyers around the world. However, in Classifieds, advertising came under significant pressure. Overall, while the revenue impact of COVID-19 in Q1 was relatively muted at the Inc. level, we did experience roughly 2 points of margin pressure driven in part by implementing programs to support our customers. In April, we have seen a surge in buyer demand resulting in double-digit Marketplace volume growth while Classifieds revenue has further decelerated based on continued advertising pressure coupled with the actions we've taken to support our Motors dealers. More specifically, here is a little more color on how the progressive impact of COVID-19 has been felt by our customers, how we've responded, and how that shows up in our results. First, as stay-at-home mandates rolled out across geographies, advertisers began pulling spend, negatively impacting third-party advertising revenue in both Classifieds and Marketplace. Second, as automotive dealers around the world were forced to close their doors to comply with local stay-at-home mandates, we acted quickly to protect our customers by eliminating subscription fees while these dealers are closed. Third, we took several additional steps across both segments to assist customers in this critical time. Some of these actions such as extending payment terms resulted in adjustments to bad debt and other reserves that are having a short-term impact on operating margins across our business. Fourth, in the last two weeks of March, we saw even more volume acceleration in Marketplace as buyers, traffic, conversion, sold items, GMV, and revenue growth all improved. In March and the first part of April, the strength was driven by confinement categories as buyers were focused on products for home offices, gym equipment, and indoor leisure activities like video games and consoles. More recently, we've seen a lift in other categories such as parts and accessories and fashion as buyers started expanding their online shopping. The growth has been broad-based and global in nature. In summary, thus far in Q2, Marketplace growth has significantly accelerated compared with Q1 with Classifieds seeing near-term pressure. The net impact of this is favorable in total. While some of the actions we've taken put short-term pressure on our financial performance, it's clear that taking care of our sellers who need some extra help during this time is the right thing to do for them and will make us an even stronger company over the longer-term. You can see examples of our actions that we've taken for our stakeholders on Slide 3 of the earnings presentation. In this rapidly changing environment, it's unclear how long these dynamics will last. I'll discuss how they influence our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year in our guidance section. Turning to Slide 5, in Q1, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, up 2% on an organic FX-neutral basis, above the high-end of our guide. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 19%. Non-GAAP margins were strong at 31.5%, inclusive of ongoing investments in managed payment and the incremental investments and expenses related to COVID-19. We generated $702 million of operating cash and $604 million of free cash flow. In addition, we closed on the sale of StubHub for $4.1 billion in cash, subject to working capital adjustments and net proceeds of $3.2 billion. In Q1, we returned $4.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on Slide 6, we have 174 million buyers representing 2% year-on-year growth, flat with Q4. Coming into Q1, we expected and saw modest buyer growth deceleration driven in part by our planned reduction of marketing spend on buyers with lower engagement and higher churn. This was completely offset by buyer acceleration in March as more buyers came to eBay for their shopping needs as stay-at-home mandates were put in place around the world. Moving to Slide 7, in Q1, we enabled $21.3 billion of Marketplace GMV, flat year-on-year and accelerating 4 points versus the prior quarter. We estimate that COVID-19 drove approximately 2 points of volume acceleration for the quarter, mostly in the second half of March. In the U.S., we generated $7.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year and accelerating five points from Q4. The year-on-year growth figure includes a 6 point headwind from the continued impact of the Internet sales tax across the U.S., in line with our expectations and approximately the same as Q4. Please refer to the appendix to see the impact of Internet sales tax over time. The 5 point acceleration versus Q4 is driven by approximately 2 points of upside from COVID-19, approximately 2 points from increased marketing efficiency and product experience improvements, and 1 point from the impact of leap year. International GMV was up 3%, accelerating 4 points versus Q4, driven by the same factors I mentioned for the U.S. Moving to revenue on Slide 8, for the company, we generated net revenues of $2.4 billion, up 2% organically, accelerating 1 point from Q4. We delivered $1.9 billion of transaction revenue, up 3% and $474 million of marketing services and other revenue, down 8%, inclusive of a 6 point headwind from the sale of brands4friends. The net impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was minimal overall with Marketplace volume driven upside offset by Classifieds downside. Turning to Slide 9, our Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 1%, accelerating 2 points from the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 3%, a 2 point acceleration versus Q4 driven by GMV and Promoted Listings, partly offset by increased credit reserves related to COVID-19. Marketing services and other revenue was down 15%, accelerating two points versus the fourth quarter. The year-on-year decline is driven by 12 points from the sale of brands4friends in addition to COVID-19 pressure on third-party ads, partially offset by six points of growth in our Korea first-party business, which grew over 60% year-on-year. Marketplace segment margin was 36%, flat year-on-year as the benefit of reduced marketing, the sale of brands4friends, and continued cost discipline were offset by our investment in managed payments and the impact of COVID-19 related impacts I mentioned earlier. Moving to Slide 10. In Q1, Classifieds revenue was flat year-on-year decelerating six points versus Q4 driven by continued headwinds in horizontal display advertising across markets in addition to COVID-19 related pressure. Segment margin for Classifieds was 33%, down three points year-on-year, driven primarily by increased reserves related to COVID-19 as we extended payment terms across markets and continued investment in verticals, which pressured margin in a period of lower revenue growth. Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. This is roughly flat year-on-year as reduced operating expenses, operating cost, and the impact of divesting brands4friends were offset by increased reserves related to COVID-19, our investment in managed payments, and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Cost of revenue is down 20 basis points year-on-year as a percentage of revenue driven by the divestiture of brands4friends, partially offset by scaling managed payments and are expanding first-party inventory program in Korea. Sales and marketing expense was down over 1 point versus the prior year primarily driven by reductions in marketing and promotional spend in our U.S. business, partially offset by increasing year-over-year investments in our international Marketplace business including off-platform, which is comprised of our higher growth businesses in Korea, Japan, and Turkey. Product development costs were up 10 basis points from investments in managed payments and Classifieds to expand our Motors vertical offerings. G&A was down 20 basis points driven by operational efficiency, partially offset by our continued investment in managed payments. We've added a view on transaction losses given the significant investments made in Q1. Transaction losses have grown approximately 150 basis points due to deferred fees and seller protection increases driven by COVID-19 that impact our bad debt and eBay Money Back Guarantee reserves. Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus the prior year, our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-GAAP EPS expansion. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by our share repurchase program, revenue growth, and our improved cost structure partially offset by our investment in managed payments and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 12% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by our share repurchase program, partially offset by lapping a higher gain associated with the Adyen warrant. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation. Moving to Slide 13. In Q1, we generated $604 million of free cash flow, up 54% driven by higher earnings and the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. Moving to Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments inclusive of the $4.1 billion we received for the sale of StubHub business and debt of $8.7 billion. For the quarter, we distributed $4 billion in the form of share buybacks and repurchased nearly 98 million shares, inclusive of an accelerated share repurchase plan that will be completed later this year. We have approximately $0.5 billion in share buyback remaining to hit the $4.5 billion we guided to in February. At this time, our expectation is that we will execute on that share buyback before the end of the year, but that will depend on market dynamics in the second half. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining and we paid $114 million in dividends. We also took two steps to further improve our liquidity position. We acquired $1 billion of debt at favorable rates that we intend to use to repay our 2020 maturities that come due in June and October. We also renewed our $2 billion credit revolver to retain financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15, our capital allocation strategy and key tenets and targets have not changed. We remain committed to maintaining our BBB+ credit rating, mid-term leverage of approximately 1.5 times net debt and gross debt below 3 times EBITDA and a year-end cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We also remain committed to our dividend. Turning to Slide 16 and Q2 guidance. For the second quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.38 billion and $2.48 billion, growing 2% to 6% on an organic FX-neutral basis. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect Marketplace revenue and volume to grow in the high-single digits year-on-year. In Classifieds, we expect significant revenue pressure contracting between 30% and 40% year-on-year, which equates to approximately 5 points of pressure at the total company level driven by temporarily waiving fees, mostly in April, and lower advertising revenue. For Marketplace, this assumes that double-digit growth in April trends back to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the quarter. If volume strength continues at a higher pace than this assumption, we expect to be at the high-end or above this range. For Classifieds, this assumes the automotive subscription revenue largely recovers in May with dealers re-opening across our markets. It also assumes a modest level of recovery in advertising. While it's difficult to predict how long these market dynamics will continue, as Scott mentioned, we feel great about the long-term prospects for this business. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.80 per share, representing 10% to 21% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by the combined benefit of the lower share count, Marketplace volume, and cost control, partially offset by lower Classifieds revenue and investments in managed payments. In addition, approximately 9 points of headwind come from a stronger U.S. dollar, a higher non-GAAP tax rate, and less interest income based on lower cash balances. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 per share to $0.57 per share in Q2. Turning to Slide 17, given this dynamic environment, we are not revising our full-year revenue, margin, and EPS estimates, but we wanted to provide you with a little bit more context on how we are thinking about the rest of the year. First, excluding the impact of COVID-19, our underlying Marketplace business is performing in line to slightly better than our expectation across several measures. Yet, we are managing through a dynamic environment with uncertainty on potential disruptions that could impact consumer buying behavior. This creates a wide range of potential outcomes for the year. The dynamics that could pressure the low-end of our guidance range would include Marketplace volume regressing to levels below what we're experiencing in early Q1 driven by consumer spending weakness and/or further macroeconomic dislocation. If Classifieds revenue showed improvement but we face continued disruption in the automotive verticals and/or slower prolonged recovery in advertising. The dynamics that would put us toward the higher-end or above our full-year range would include; marketplace volumes stronger than our original second half plan driven by more permanent offline to online shopping shift and our ability to effectively retain the new buyers and sellers; and if Classifieds revenue improves more quickly returning to growth in the second half, but below pre-COVID-19 levels. We expect that margin rates could have increased variability in the coming quarters, given some of the revenue and macroeconomic dynamics, but our cost discipline remains strong and we're committed to our long-term margin structure previously communicated of 2 points of expansion by 2022. It's also a volatile time for currency and given the global nature of our business, significant movements can have a material impact on our results. If current rates hold, we would have revenue pressure of approximately $100 million and $0.04 of EPS compared to our February guide. We now expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This increase of $1 billion versus our February guidance is based solely on the expectation that the cash tax payments related to the sale of StubHub will be recorded in discontinued operations. We have a strong balance sheet, our liquidity is in great shape and our business models continues to generate strong free cash flow in any of the above scenarios. In closing, these are challenging times for everyone. We remain focused on our employees, communities, and customers while continuing to deliver for our investors. Our key growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising are on track. We continue to fight through the lingering impacts of lower marketing spend and Internet sales tax and we'll exit the year stronger than we entered on these fronts. Above all, we will continue to focus on the safety of our stakeholders and on returning the Marketplace business to sustainable long-term growth by providing a trusted platform for buyers and sellers to transact around the world. And now, Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions, operator? Yeah, look, Stephen, I think the way we think about it is we've been working for a long time to improve the buyer experience across the site and we have an opportunity here with some pretty healthy buyer growth at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter to further leverage that. We're going to continue to invest in these buyers to ensure that they are finding and realizing the value and selection that we offer and continuing to drive engagement with these customers is critical. It's super early in the process. New buyers typically will engage a little less frequency and buy a little less than retained buyers and we're seeing similar behaviors, but one of our key focus is in the coming weeks and months is going to be how do we work to drive increased engagement with the buyer growth that we've had recently. Well, I'll maybe double click a little bit on the GMV comment and the sustainability of it. Just you know clearly in the guide for the quarter and the year, we're not counting on those rates of growth continuing. We haven't seen anything through April to suggest that they don't. So to the extent that they would continue at or not trend down as quickly, we'd see some upside, but to Scott's point looking to engage and take advantage of the incremental buyers we have and leverage them through the process. Yeah. Hey, Eric. It's Andy, I'll take both of those. Like I think both -- Scott and I both said in our script, the beginning part of this quarter was performing as we expected on almost all fronts and buyers are no different. As we said, you know, most of last year, we've been shifting marketing expense away trying to drive an increased CLV with buyers and we expected to see some deceleration in the first quarter and we were seeing it and we've seen healthy buyer growth the last couple of weeks of March. So absent the lift in COVID, I think that you'd probably be looking at slightly lower buyer growth, but keep in mind that's a trailing 12-month measure and it's really hard to move that in a period of two weeks. So, as -- we'll I'm sure disclose much more as we get through the second quarter on the growth rates, but you can assume with 20% GMV growth that we've had some pretty healthy buyer growth as well. The second question on IST, look, I think part of the reason we're talking less about it is its just relative to everything else going on, it's a smaller issue. Fundamentally, nothing's changed other than it's performing basically exactly as we thought it would. When we entered the year, we had I think two states we lapped on January 1st. The thesis at the time in what we're seeing in early January was that we would lap out of the headwind as states reached the 12-month mark. We had a few weeks of data at the time and we said that that's what we saw. We now have four states that have lapped out and we're seeing consistent data across all those states. So we remain confident that we'll see lift half over half driven by IST as that headwind dissipates, but the reality is we had in the U.S., 6 points of headwind in the fourth quarter. We thought first quarter would be roughly 6 points, we think it was still roughly 6 points in the first quarter. So kind of to our expectations on that front. Okay, Heath, thanks. I'll take the first one. I think Scott will handle the second one. I'll try to give a little more color and you hinted at it at the beginning of your statement that it's super early and it's unclear how any of these things will really mature over time, but a couple of things that we did see. Early on, C2C was not really partaking in the growth that we saw relative to second half of March and we think that's related a little bit to the fact that to your people were moving around maybe less likely to go to the post office or deliver things and we've seen that recover a bit as we've gotten into April. In terms of supply, the listings on the site are healthy despite the fact that we've had the relatively quick ramp and spike in volume so that we haven't seen a reduction in listings on the site. In fact, I think they've grown a bit through April to support the volume spike that we're seeing on the B2C side. So we feel like supply is healthy. We've been onboarding as Scott mentioned and I mentioned onboarding new sellers through this process as well. So feel good about supply."

            "name": "Scott Schenkel",
            "content": "Thanks, Jamie. Good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to the year ahead of our expectations. Our volume is accelerating, managed payments and ads are delivering growth and are on track for long-term success. We are executing our product road map, improving buyer and seller experience and conversion, and we are driving margin expansion. We closed the StubHub deal in February, quickly deployed proceeds to reward shareholders, made progress on the Classifieds portfolio, and strengthened our balance sheet. While executing on our Q1 priorities, COVID-19 dramatically changed the world. Individuals and families are sheltering in place, millions of people have lost their jobs, and communities are struggling. Our purpose has always been to empower people and create economic opportunity for all. We are fortunate to have a resilient business that can help in times like these. That purpose and resiliency have inspired us to deploy well over $100 million to support our employees, communities, customers around the world at a time when they need it most, positioning our stakeholders to exit this crisis stronger. The health and safety of our employees and their communities is our top priority and I want to thank our team for their remarkable dedication during this difficult time. In line with government guidelines, we shifted the vast majority of our team to work from home, many for the first time, including thousands of customer service team members around the world. We provided them with equipment, training, and resources to support their transition. We also financially protected our hourly and alternative workforces, ensuring they get paid while society is asking them to do their part. We have also empowered our leaders to provide employees flexibility to balance health, well being, family, and professional responsibilities. We are also investing millions of dollars into our communities. Through eBay for Charity, we are matching contributions made by U.S. customers to Feeding America, Direct Relief and the Opportunity Fund. In the U.S. buyers can also purchase gifts that give back to support relief efforts and in the U.K. buyers can donate at checkout to support NHS Charities Together. Through the eBay Foundation, we have funded several non-profit organizations supporting small businesses and community relief efforts around the world, including Silicon Valley Strong in our home city of San Jose. During this crisis, the eBay Marketplace has remained open for everyone, granting buyers access to a wide selection of global inventory and aggregating growing demand for sellers. For hundreds of thousands of small businesses worldwide, we offered to defer fees, provided store subscribers with more free listings, and protected seller performance standards. We are also supporting small brick and mortar retailers by offering free listings and free store subscriptions for first time sellers along with mentors to help get them started. Thousands of new sellers have signed up across our global markets further expanding the strength of our supply. In addition to investing in small businesses, we are partnering with government officials on a local, state, national, and international level to prevent price gouging, stop false health claims, and prevent illegal products from being sold. To ensure that our platform remains safe and trusted, we have blocked or removed more than 15 million listings to date from our global Marketplace that violate COVID-19 policies. We are also advocating on behalf of small businesses with legislators through a grassroots advocacy program to ensure they benefit from important economic relief decisions and programs. In our Classifieds Motors verticals, many dealers were forced to close their business temporarily and we provided them with immediate help by waiving fees and extending payment terms. We also added new ways in our experience for customers to connect directly with dealers to drive leads. On our horizontal Classifieds platforms, we rapidly adapted our product experiences by educating users how to trade safely and by launching a neighborhood assistance category that connects customers confined to their home to those who want to help. These efforts have improved vibrancy while protecting our supply and demand in the near-term. While some of these actions impacted Q1 and create short-term financial headwinds, our Classifieds platforms are positioned to exit stronger when businesses reopen as we are starting to see in Germany. While supporting our customers and employees, we over-delivered for our shareholders on our Q1 commitments. Before the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 started impacting our business in late Q1, our key metrics were performing better than our expectations through the first 11 weeks. The roll out of new and expanded experiences for buyers and sellers along with the acceleration in managed payments and ads were driving improvement in GMV and revenue despite the continued headwinds from Internet sales tax and reductions in marketing spend that skewed towards the U.S. Since then, COVID-19 impacted our major markets as shelter-in-place actions were required and we saw an immediate change in the growth trajectory. In Marketplace, there was an initial surge in home confinement categories in late March, which then expanded in April across all verticals including parts and accessories, fashion and more. Since the start of April, GMV has been growing over 20% in our major on-platform markets every week. Andy will go into further detail about recent trends in his remarks. In total for Q1, volume was flat compared to a year ago, a 4 point improvement versus Q4 with U.S. volume 5 points better and international volume 4 points better. Organic revenue was up 2%, above the high-end of our guidance. Margins were strong at 31.5% driven by operational cost savings that helped fund managed payments as well as incremental investments and expenses related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 19%, substantially better than expected. In addition, we closed the StubHub deal in February, expanded our 2020 share buyback plan to $4.5 billion, paid our dividend as planned, and strengthened our capital structure. Independent of COVID-19 effects, we made progress on our key priorities in the first quarter. Our underlying operating plans remain the same as we communicated in January, which were to deliver our growth initiatives of managed payments and ads, provide more seller tools, improve buyer experiences, and leverage our structured data foundation while delivering margin expansion. Our growth initiatives continue to stay on track and are making meaningful contributions to our results, a testimony to our employees and partners working from home around the world and to our leadership team's tenacity. The managed payments transition continues to gain momentum. Buyers are getting more choice and a seamless checkout while sellers are saving money on a simpler experience that offers quick and flexible ways to get paid. Since launch, we have processed more than $3 billion of GMV for over 32,000 sellers on our payment rails while saving them millions in fees. U.S. volume remains at the limit permitted under the operating agreement, while in Germany we ramped from 3% in December to 6% in March on our way to 10% by mid-year. We recently announced to sellers in the U.K., Australia, and Canada that their transitions will begin in July. Many are already pre-registered and we encourage sellers to visit our Seller Center for more information on how we can accelerate their ability to save money and simplify their eBay experience. We are confident in our plan to transition the vast majority of sellers starting in July through the end of 2021 as managed payments will become the only way to buy and sell on eBay. We remain on track to realizing an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in 2022. As a reminder, these economics do not include any benefits from improved experience or reduced friction for buyers and sellers. Advertising continues to drive revenue growth and had a strong start to the year. In Q1, Promoted Listings delivered $137 million of revenue, up 111%. Nearly 1.2 million sellers promoted more than 310 million listings in the quarter. Sellers continue to adopt Promoted Listings to drive conversion while buyers are seeing a better eBay experience with fewer third-party ads. Although third-party ad revenue continues to decline, our overall advertising revenues grew more than 25% for the quarter. In Q1, we raised performance standards for all sellers which modestly reduced the number of Promoted Listings, but yielded improved conversion. We remain on track with our plan to deliver $800 million in total ad revenue this year on our way to building $1 billion advertising business in the next couple of years. In our on-platform marketplace business, we continue to invest and expand in seller tools and capabilities. Seller initiated offers allow a seller to offer lower prices to individual buyers to drive conversion. In Q1, this scaled to over 1.5 million offers per day, driven by increased adoption in item eligibility. We also rolled out an image quality tool, which is helping sellers improve photos on their listings. The majority of the sellers that have used the tool have enhanced their images contributing to a more consistent looking buyer experience. We expect this to lead to better conversion over time. Multi-user authentication capabilities are helping small business teams manage their business securely and these features have extended globally and integrated with order management and price guidance tools. On the buyer experience, we saw an increased conversion through improvements in search that were enabled by growth in structured data. Based on behavioral data, our algorithms recommend to sellers which information can maximize the velocity of their listings as sellers add more structured data in the form of aspects, their listings are increasingly showing up in filtered search results. This leads to higher conversion as buyers are more likely to discover and purchase their items. We also raised the limit of saved searches for hundreds of thousands of highly engaged loyal buyers who reached the previous cap of 100 searches, allowing them to expand their shopping on eBay. Millions of buyers are tracking their shipments on our platform and we are sending notifications to alert them of early or late deliveries. Our overall delivery performance has held up well during the COVID-19 crisis as our supply base does not have large single points of failure nor are their fulfillment constraints for essential or non-essential items on eBay. With the disruption to exports from China during the quarter, our speed pack efforts combined with our existing domestic sellers supply allowed for strong inventory availability and delivery performance. While executing these and other improvements for buyers and sellers in our product experiences, we also delivered on margin expansion. We realized efficiencies in our marketing spend and reduced operating costs in a number of areas. The cost to scale managed payments are in line with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver at least 2 points of incremental margin by 2022. In Q1, our international on and off platform businesses had similar volume dynamics. In Korea, our underlying volume growth rate was consistent with Q4, but total volume accelerated modestly from upside in essential categories due to COVID-19. Revenues grew at double-digit rate due to the ongoing expansion of our first-party inventory program. Despite significant marketing by competitors that is likely deeply negative ROI, we have a leading position in Korea with double-digit growth, first-party FMCG capabilities, and significant scale. Margin dynamics are well above most peers in the market although margin contribution is significantly less than our on-platform markets in the rest of the world due to marketing spend differences and the first-party sales mix. Aside from ongoing business results, I would like to take a step back from recent performance to address the ongoing portfolio review of our Classifieds business. As we previously stated, we are in active discussions with multiple parties exploring value creating alternatives. We remain committed to maximizing value for shareholders and will provide an update by our Q2 earnings call in the middle of the year. Despite the short-term disruption to the industry presented by COVID-19, the long-term prospects for Classifieds are strong. We believe that the recovery period will create more growth opportunities for our platform. As a frame of reference, following the '08, '09 financial crisis, used car sales outpaced new car sales for several years and the shift from offline to online advertising accelerated. Those two macro dynamics provided tailwinds and rewarded players with strong demand and supply and we believe our Motors verticals and ad-based horizontal platforms are well positioned to perform strongly in that environment. Over the past several months, we have driven significant changes to position the business for sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Underlying volume is improving and consumer demand during shelter-in-place has surged. We've approached this pandemic striving to support our employees, communities, and customers and exit this global crisis stronger. We continue executing on our growth initiatives, delivering product experience improvements, improving margins, and over-delivering on our financial commitments. Looking ahead, with a distributed and scalable seller base, a strong balance sheet and cash flows, low capital intensity, and disciplined management, we have the strength and flexibility to adapt to this economic environment. Personally, I'm grateful for the opportunity to lead this team and business over the past several months, not to mention my time as CFO in the eight years before that. I remain excited for eBay's future prospects and look forward to my next chapter. Now let me turn it over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Mr. Cring? So, Stephen, on payments, look, I think our comfort level remains very strong. The team is executing well. We have two markets up and running, three now announced as we just went through. We're pre-onboarding customers on to rails that have been working. We continue to get great feedback from sellers and continue to expand and so our focus is going fast and letting our sellers really get the benefit of a simpler experience that's less expensive and a better experience integrated into their selling account and the buyers having more options and so we feel good about it. On the buyers back to normal, Andy, you want to take that one? Yeah, maybe a few points and then Andy jump in. So the sustainability of 20% I think what we're calling out in our guide is that we expect it to trend back down, although it's obviously very hard to tell. The benefit that we've seen is first is as I called out and then Andy emphasized, we've had a really good out of the gate kind of what we term confinement categories and broadly speaking, those categories would cover roughly 25% of the site and that started to accelerate and then what you saw is as that settled down and as that matured, you started to see buyers buying in all of the other categories. And so, what you see now is a broad-based expansion of the growth in other categories on eBay without really any being left behind per se and so from that perspective, it feels good. I think to the spirit of your question, we will continue to be spending. The nice part is these new buyers fit right into our strategy of going after the buyers we brought in the last 12 to 24 months. We're trying to activate them and so they'll go right into those cohorts and really we'll be working on things like getting them to sign up for the mobile app if they didn't come through the mobile app, getting them to fully register as a user, if they were only a guest, continuing to hammer them with emails and other value that's available on the site. So tons of opportunities there. I don't know, Andy, do you want to weigh in on the ad rate or anything else I left out on that? Yeah, and then hey Ross, to get back to the other parts of your 14 point question here, let me try on Classifieds, the Classifieds, look, I think, certainly we have got the pressure from ads. I don't anticipate once dealerships come back, that we'll have ongoing pressure from that. And so the dynamic as we look towards the second half of the year and certainly for the longer-term, we don't feel it impacts the valuation of the company and thus accordingly, we're not really looking at the portfolio, discussions that aren't going any differently than we were three to six months ago and so we are in active conversations with multiple parties as I called out and we'll give you an update by the Q2 earnings call. And then Korea, sorry, Korea -- look, Korea is a great platform and we elaborated a bit more at least in my script on a bit more of the dynamics around what we're seeing there and you know, good double-digit revenue growth in that business this quarter, a little bit of highlight of the contribution operating income dynamics that we get out of that business versus some of the others and I think as we've demonstrated along the way and the Board has demonstrated, we'll continue to be clinical about how we approach all of our portfolio around eBay. Right now we're focused on Classifieds and making sure we maximize value for shareholders in that transaction. Did I get them all there? Yeah, you know, the other thing I'd add to that Heath is what we saw in January and February in particular when China was more shut down, we saw a dynamic that we've kind of confirmed and what we saw was just the strength in the overall global ecosystem of seller and listing and inventory availability, which was even as China was restricted, we saw domestic sellers step-up with additional inventory in the different markets where we have the buy side. So obviously, we don't have a buy side of China to speak of, it's super small. So the corridor out of China as that got a bit restricted in January and February in particular, we saw the other seller step-up and really not miss a beat and so just the quality of the sellers in the global supply chain was quite profound and so we saw tons of benefit there as kind of supply shifted around. As other markets -- Western markets started to shelter-in-place, China came back online and quickly really with a lot of help from our seller team in China, helped get them back online and shipping using our speed pack capabilities, which give them the capability to get inventory into other markets very quickly and so that was terrific. So I think broadly speaking, we walked away from the last six, seven weeks or even last quarter feeling very good about the supply quality. And to your question on C2C, I think it's a bit early to really see any substantial strength from C2C, but I would expect that as we go forward and certainly what people have already started to see in our international markets in particular is additional messaging to C2C sellers to re-engage with the platform if they haven't been around recently. So that'll be -- you'll see that in most major markets. On the question for -- I think that's Jamie, just in the interest of time, we'll park that and we'll let Jamie come back to that when we get to July. Well, a couple of things that I think we saw in Q1 that we feel great about. First off, while we raised the level of what was required for sellers to participate in Promoted Listings, we saw better quality listings go into search results and other placements that had better conversion and I think you've heard me talk about a number of times that the trick here to get to $1 billion and then north of there is making sure that this is accretive to the user experience and not a distraction, not sending people elsewhere and I think we walk away from Q1 feeling great about that. We'll work on the $1 billion first and then we'll update you after that, but look, I think the team has done an excellent job and what you're going to see us continue to do is iterate on placements, pricing, all sorts of things to just make this accretive to the user experience and I don't think the team sees any limits to this and they're really focused on it that way. Thanks."

Then I will focus on the near-term progress we are making towards our strategic vision. And finally, provide a short preview of our Investor Day in 2 weeks. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.  The fourth quarter marked another solid quarter for sellers and buyers on eBay. They benefited from investments in our strategy to drive sustainable growth in our marketplace. We are simplifying the seller and buyer experience, increasing customer satisfaction and improving our underlying growth trajectory.  Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. We are seeing faster GMV growth in focus categories that now represent approximately 20% of global volume. We successfully completed our multiyear payments transition on time with more customer benefits and with greater financial impact than expected. Our advertising business grew faster than marketplace volume as more sellers adopted new ad products. We delivered revenue growth at the high end of our expectations and earnings growth above guidance. And finally, we continue to execute our ESG agenda. In addition to being carbon-neutral, we made progress on our long-term sustainability targets, and eBay for Charity finished a record-breaking year.  I'm very pleased with our Q4 financial results. We delivered 5% revenue growth on the back of payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, more than the high end of expectations. For the full year, revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 21%.  As proud as I am of our team for delivering these results, I am more excited about eBay's future based on the response from our customers to the strategy we are implementing. This is evident in focused categories. We are delivering best-in-class customer satisfaction, and it is leading to faster GMV growth. In Q4, focus categories grew 15 points faster than the rest of the marketplace.  The next category we are focused on is motors, parts and accessories or P&A for short. This is one of our largest categories globally and is full of enthusiasts who are passionate about what they trade on eBay. Many are very active buyers who shop in multiple categories, with over 60% of the eBay spend coming on products outside P&A.  Starting in December, we began investing in top-of-funnel marketing across TV, radio and social sales in partnership with key industry influencers. These ads highlight the valuable choices P&A enthusiasts have on eBay across hundreds of millions of listings. In addition, we implemented monetization changes to higher-priced items and saw an increase in listings during Q4.  We are leveraging the scale of our supply in new ways. With input from our P&A sellers, we simplified our global category structure. This makes it easier for buyers to find unique parts from around the world, unlocking more cross-border trade. These initial changes led to modestly better performance in P&A GMV during Q4 relative to the overall business. It's early days, and we plan to make further investments this year to improve our trajectory in this category.  In focus categories where we have been investing for several quarters, we have seen growth sustained at higher levels. Sneakers over $100 continued to grow double digits globally. Our success in the U.S. is being replicated in other major markets. Part of that success is authentication, which is scaled to 5 countries over the past year. And in Q4, we started authenticating cross-border transactions into the U.S.  But we are not stopping there. Last quarter, we acquired Sneaker Con, a leading authenticator with operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and Germany. By bringing additional capacity in-house, we increased the scale and flexibility of our operations. We also introduced 3D true view on select listings. This capability increases trust for buyers shopping for unique, high-value pre-owned items.  Given our success in driving customer satisfaction to over 90% and sustained double-digit GMV growth, we have reintroduced monetization in the U.S. for sneakers over $100. The initial customer feedback has been encouraging as sellers continue to benefit from a lower take rate than many other platforms. Sellers are also listing more luxury watches on eBay. We saw a double-digit increase in supply quarter-over-quarter, and total GMV in this category continues to grow at strong double-digit rates in the U.S.  In Germany and the U.K., authentication is also leading to higher customer satisfaction. In luxury handbags, we saw acceleration in Q4 to positive double-digit growth in the U.S. Based on the success of authenticity guarantee, we are growing the number of brands covered by the program. In addition, we have expanded selection by authenticating cross-border imports from Japan, a key source of unique inventory. And just a few weeks ago, we announced authenticity guarantee for all single ungraded trading cards sold for over $750 in the U.S. We plan to expand this offering to include graded autograph and pass cars sold for more than $250 later this year.  As we exited 2021, our Certified Refurbished program had expanded to over 320 brands. This program now includes brands like Microsoft, Dyson, Samsung Galaxy and KitchenAid. And as a reminder, these products are certified by the manufacturer, are like new and are backed by a 2-year warranty and eBay's money back guarantee. Higher trust has increased customer satisfaction and accelerated GMV to positive double-digit rates. Certified Refurbished products from top brands make up a small percentage of the total refurb activity on eBay but are growing significantly faster. This has inspired us to expand further. And in November, we announced eBay Refurbished, a destination for like new products. This expanded experience adds more inventory from top-rated sellers. These trusted sellers are thoroughly vetted to meet rigorous performance standards so buyers can purchase with even greater confidence.  In Q4, we saw promising early results from this expansion in mobile phones and plan to extend to tablets, smart watches and laptops this year.  In addition to improvements in focus categories, we made a number of changes during Q4 that benefited sellers and buyers across all categories globally. We've started a pilot with our API sellers to add video to their listings. To date, we have seen hundreds of thousands of listings add video content. Buyers get a rich shopping experience on individual item pages and in seller stores. Looking ahead, we plan to enable more sellers to tell their story by adding videos through additional listing flows.  Another new growth capability we are scaling for sellers is coded coupons. Since launch, sellers have realized over $350 million in GMV. Over 60,000 sellers have driven repeat purchases from almost 6 million buyers. Buyer trust is essential in a third-party marketplace and is an area of focus for our technology investment.  In Q4, we leveraged artificial intelligence to significantly decrease the time to detect and remove counterfeits. In the categories where it has been deployed to date, most listings are renewed before a buyer has a chance to see it. These are a few recent examples of how we are using technology to increase trust while simplifying seller and buyer experiences.  Moving on to payments. In Q4, we completed the transition to a modern payments platform by migrating all remaining sellers away from the legacy system. This has resulted in a simpler seller experience, lower fees for most sellers, more choice for buyers and better-than-expected financial results. Although this marks the culmination of a major multiyear effort, in reality, this is just the beginning. By managing seller and buyer money flows, we can remove transactional friction and provide more trusted services. We've been systematically eliminating unpaid items, which removed friction for approximately 10 million transactions in 2021. In addition, sellers are being paid faster for weekend sales in most major markets.  We are also exploring new ways to allow sellers and buyers to benefit from our scale. In the U.S., we recently launched a partnership with Chase Freedom rewards that increases top-of-funnel impressions, driving buyer traffic to eBay. We are excited by the value payments has provided our seller and buyer community, and we see more growth opportunities ahead.  Moving to advertising. In Q4, ad revenue growth once again outpaced volume due to Promoted Listings, driving approximately $227 million in revenue, up 4%. Adoption grew at double-digit rates in both the number of sellers and the number of listings promoted. Looking at the full year, our advertising business, including both first-party and third-party ad products, surpassed $1 billion, up 9%. To drive the next growth cycle in advertising, we expanded the rollout of new products to more sellers and markets during the quarter.  PL Express, our auction listings product, was fully launched to all major markets. We also integrated this feature into more listing tools to drive further adoption. For PL Advanced, our cost per click offering, we opened access to AI-driven recommendations for keywords and bid pricing. While this product remains in a limited beta as we optimize the customer experience, we are increasing exposure and streamlining reporting for sellers.  For external Promoted Listings, we continue to ramp more affiliate traffic through the eBay partner network. We also increased traffic from external paid search to Promoted Listings in European markets. Participating sellers are seeing increased traffic and conversion while maintaining control over ad pricing.  We have carefully meted the rollout out of these new products while balancing impacts to our buyer experience. Despite the limited release, new ad products provide a material contribution to Promoted Listings revenue growth in Q4. We expect this to accelerate in the coming quarters as availability and adoption of these new product increases.  Another area where we made significant progress last year was in e-commerce. Volume of pre-loved products grew faster than new products in 2021 driven by demand from younger consumers. For the full year, we delivered $2.7 billion of GMV in pre-loved electronics and apparel in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.  In addition to providing customers great value on unique used goods, e-commerce activity also helped to meet our sustainability goals. These purchases reduced carbon emissions by approximately 540,000 metric tons in 2021. eBay is a carbon-neutral company, and I'm thrilled by the recognition we recently received as a sustainability leader in e-commerce.  For the third year running, eBay has made the Dow Jones Sustainability World in North American indices, putting us in the top 10% of companies in our industry globally. eBay was also included in Just Capital and CNBC's Just 100 list. This list measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. When compared to nearly 1,000 companies, eBay ranked 88th overall and fourth in retail when it comes to minimizing our environmental impact. I'm really proud of the progress our team is making here.  The eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity. In Q4, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise almost $37 million, up 6%. And for the year, customers raised over $145 million, up 18%, the most raised since we started this program almost 20 years ago.  Lastly, we were honored this year to receive Glassdoor's 2022 Employees' Choice Award. This award reflects anonymous feedback from current and former employees regarding topics such as crew opportunities, culture and values, and diversity inclusion, just to name a few. We are truly honored to be recognized by the people who make eBay the company it is.  Now I would like to talk about our upcoming Investor Day on March 10. In July of 2020, I outlined a clear vision of a winning strategy for the company. Since that time, we increased our focus on sellers and buyers, accelerated the pace of innovation, simplified the portfolio and revamped the leadership team. We also drove successful multiyear initiatives in payments and advertising, both of which exceeded ambitious targets. This unprecedented level of change in eBay all happened in parallel with a global pandemic that massively disrupted short-term consumer behavior. Their early results have demonstrated that our strategy is working, and the business is stronger than it was before the pandemic. Our focus categories are returning to market rates of growth. High-value buyers are growing, and they are spending more. We are empowering sellers by simplifying their experience, saving them money and providing tools to accelerate their growth.  Our technology investments are driving a simpler and more sustainable marketplace. And along the way, our investors have been rewarded with strong earnings growth and significant capital returns.  Looking ahead, we're excited about the next few years as we build on the momentum we have established. I look forward to introducing you to our world-class leadership team and sharing more about our plans, along with a few new initiatives we will unveil at Investor Day. We have our eyes squarely focused on deepening our relationship with sellers and buyers and building the world's most sustainable marketplace for the eBay community.  In closing, I would like to sincerely thank our extraordinary employees for an amazing year. They completed a huge payments transition, executed 2 large dispositions and improved the underlying growth of our business. While doing so, they delivered tremendous sustainability results and supported sellers and buyers during these challenging times.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights from the quarter and full year on Slide 4 of our investor presentation. Next, I'll walk through key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our forward outlook and closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.  Overall, we are pleased with our Q4 results as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics, capping off an exceptional 2021 for eBay. I've been inspired by our team's relentless focus and execution amid uncertain economic and operating conditions throughout the year. Importantly, our performance in 2021 demonstrated the progress we have made towards a return to durable, sustainable growth in the years ahead.  Revenue grew 5% to $2.6 billion in Q4, over 15 points faster than volume growth. For 2021, revenue grew 15% to $10.4 billion, up 18 points faster than volume growth. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter. For the full year, we generated approximately $3.5 billion of operating profit at 33.4% margin. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $1.05 in Q4. For the full year, EPS grew 21% to $4.02. We generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in 2021 and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  Let's take a deeper look into our key operating and financial metrics. As a reminder, we adjusted our definition of GMV in December following the completion of our payments migration. The change had a modest impact on our historical GMV and active buyer figures, but the impact of the change on year-over-year growth for each metric in Q4 was immaterial.  Starting with active buyers. We ended 2021 with 147 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 9% year-over-year decline. The expected decrease in active buyers was primarily driven by low value buyers, which fell 9% versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in high-value buyers over the same period was 3%. Although fewer buyers sold on eBay as compared to prepandemic levels, total high-value buyers were up due to growth in high spending and [indiscernible]. And importantly, even as mobility restrictions have been lifted, spend for high-value buyer continues to expand at healthy rates.  Our buyers purchased $20.7 billion of GMV in Q4, which marked an 11% decline and landed near the high end of our outlook. Compared with Q4 of 2019, GMV grew 9% at constant currency, representing a 3-point deceleration sequentially. On a geographic basis, U.S. GMV grew 22% versus Q4 of 2019, while international GMV declined 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Our U.S. and international markets were impacted by softness in overall online shopping activity during the Cyber Five holiday period, but both geographies improved during the remainder of December.  Consistent with prior quarters, numerous factors contributed to the growth differential between our U.S. and international markets. Core macroeconomic factors like GDP, retail growth and inflation have been notably stronger in the U.S. than our international markets. Other macro factors like global supply chain disruptions, shipping constraints and other export challenges have had a negative impact on growth in our international markets. These dynamics have particularly impacted sellers involved in cross-border trade, which skew towards non-U.S. markets.  Conversely, our domestic sellers likely benefited from item scarcity due to supply changes. Our domestic GMV has benefited from momentum in collectibles, which is largely a U.S. phenomenon. In addition, high ASP luxury categories are growing faster in the U.S. as the rollout of our innovation playbook is more nascent internationally. However, as our luxury categories build momentum and we roll out product improvements in categories like P&A, which represents a higher share of GMV in international markets, growth outside the U.S. should see greater benefit.  Our focus category coverage expanded to approximately 20% of GMV as we made product improvements in P&A and broadened our country footprint in existing luxury categories. Focus categories outpaced growth in other categories by approximately 15 points in Q4, demonstrating the impact of our innovation playbook.  Net revenue during the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 5%, while transaction revenue also grew 5%. Under our updated definition of GMV, our transaction take rate of 11.8% was roughly in line with Q3 as we completed the managed payments migration. Managed payments contributed 15 points of revenue growth in Q4 and generated $2 billion of incremental revenue in 2021, meeting our full year target. We remain excited about the potential for managed payments to open up new opportunities in financial services for our sellers and buyers.  Within our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 4% during the quarter, outpacing volume by 15 points. As Jamie noted, we are encouraged by the progress of our new ad products, which began to gradually move the needle from Promoted Listings growth during the quarter.  Moving down the P&L. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31.6%. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, increasing by close to 200 basis points versus 2019. This leverage was particularly notable given the incremental contribution from managed payments, which generates material operating profit, but is dilutive to reporting operating margins.  Cost of revenue rose by over 4 points as a percentage of revenue in Q4 year-over-year due to the variable payment processing costs from managed payments. With the migration behind us, we expect gross margin to stabilize around the current run rate in the short term with normal seasonal fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. Our other operating expenses declined by over 4 points in aggregate, roughly offsetting the decline in gross margin as payments revenue post fewer fixed expenses.  Turning to earnings per share. During the quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, up 24%. Contributions from payments and advertising in conjunction with share repurchases offset the lapping of mobility tailwinds last year. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $1.47 due primarily to mark-to-market losses on our investment portfolio. We generated $372 million of free cash flow in Q4 and ended the year with cash and non-equity investments of $7.3 billion as well as gross debt of $9.1 billion. We repurchased $3 billion of shares during Q4, an average price of approximately $70 per share, with the majority of our buyback executed through accelerated share repurchase programs. Additional ASR details will be available in our 10-K filing. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $107 million in December, representing $0.18 per share.  Our investments are detailed on Slide 13. After closing our Permira and Korea deals, which yielded approximately $5 billion in cash, our remaining investment portfolio was worth over $8 billion in aggregate at the end of Q4. Our remaining Adevinta shares were valued at $5.4 billion. We held approximately $1.1 billion of Adyen shares after exercising our first tranche of warrants during Q4. Including the estimated value of our remaining warrant tranches, our total Adyen investment amounted to $1.5 billion. Our stake in KakaoBank was worth roughly $700 million. And finally, the fair value of our nearly 20% ownership interest in Gmarket in Korea was approximately $700 million.  Moving to our outlook, beginning with the full year on Slide 14. To summarize, 2022 will be the tale of 2 halves. During the first half of the year, we'll lap significant mobility and macro tailwinds from 2021, with margins pressured as we scale investments sequentially. During the second half, we should observe the cleanest year-over-year comps we've encountered since entering the pandemic, revealing the underlying growth and earnings power of our business.  For the full year, we forecast GMV to decline by 5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis, with an FX headwind of roughly 200 to 300 basis points to reported growth. We anticipate the GMV decline in the mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis during the first half as we lap a period of significant global mobility restrictions and the U.S. stimulus effects. In the second half, we expect flat to modestly positive GMV growth and anticipate exiting the year growing volume at 2% to 3% in constant currency. Notably, the quarterly phasing of our GMV should more closely approximate prepandemic seasonality moving forward, assuming mobility and macro factors remain relatively stable throughout the year.  We expect our 2022 take rate to expand by roughly 1 point driven primarily by a full year of managed payments and increased revenue contribution from Promoted Listings as we scale our new products. We forecast 2022 revenue of $10.3 billion to $10.5 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of flat to positive 3%. During the first half, we expect revenues to decline in the low to mid-single digits before reaccelerating in the second half to go in the mid- to high single digits in constant currency.  As we exit Q4, we expect the relationship between revenue and GMV to tighten as we fully lap the managed payments rollout. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of between 30% and 31% this year. The second quarter should mark the low point for margins during the year as we lap difficult comps and ramp up our pace of investment. Our investments in focus categories last year had a measurable positive impact on growth. Thus, we are doubling down on investments in products and full funnel marketing initiatives in 2022, supporting these categories. We're confident these investments will improve customer satisfaction rates and drive sustainable growth in the years ahead.  We forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $4.20 and $4.40 in 2022. During the first half of the year, we expect EPS to be down low single digits year-over-year as we lap last year's outstanding growth and scale investments. However, the midpoint of our outlook implies EPS will grow in the high teens during the second half as GMV turns positive and revenue outpaces volume.  Our Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion, bringing our total authorization to approximately $6 billion. We are also raising our quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.22 per share, our third consecutive double-digit raise since establishing our dividend in 2019.  Looking at the first quarter guidance on Slide 15. We forecast revenue between $2.43 billion and $2.48 billion, representing a decline between 5% and 7% at constant currency. We expect our take rate to be roughly stable sequentially, implying GMV is down 17% to 19% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margins between 31.5% and 32% in Q1, up modestly versus Q4 at the midpoint, but down 5 to 6 points year-over-year as we lap extraordinary volume leverage last year due to COVID. We project non-GAAP EPS between $1.01 and $1.05 in Q1, representing a year-over-year decline of 6% to a decline of 3%.  In closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for eBay. We delivered strong Q4 and full year results despite a challenging operating environment, uncertain macro conditions and constantly changing consumer behavior throughout the pandemic. Our focus categories meaningfully outpace overall volume growth due to increased customer satisfaction rates, offering demonstrable proof that our innovation playbook is working.  We generated $2 billion of revenue from managed payments this year after completing our migration and still see many more opportunities to leverage financial services to reduce friction for sellers and buyers on eBay. We delivered over $1 billion of advertising revenue this year and significantly broadened our ad portfolio to meet the needs of more sellers, helping them grow their businesses on eBay.  We've made prudent investments in people, product and technology to support our strategic pillars. We believe these investments will drive durable growth in our marketplace in the years ahead. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 21% on top of strong earnings growth in the prior year, generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, unlocked billions more from our portfolio divestitures and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  We are proud to have taken meaningful steps to improve our environmental impact this year by achieving 100% carbon neutrality, setting ambitious science-based targets for the future and the continuous progress we are making as we focus on driving e-commerce and the circular economy as a whole.  I would like to echo Jamie's thanks to our incredible employee base as their tireless efforts have been instrumental in bringing our strategy to life. To our valued sellers and buyers in the eBay community, your response to our investments in trust and innovation give us conviction that we are on the right path. We are excited to reveal more details about our future road map very soon.  To the investment community, we appreciate your continued interest and look forward to hosting you at our virtual Investor Day on March 10.  With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.\nScott Devitt: I have two. The first, U.S. and international GMV growth rates have been diverging recently, favoring the U.S. for a variety of reasons. And so as we get through to the second half of '22, in which overall GMV improves to flat to modest -- modestly positive and you begin lapping the -- of stimulus and mobility dynamics, supply chain cross-border and differences in the reopening time in various countries, should we assume that U.S. versus international growth dynamics converge, even maybe favoring international due to cross-border? And are there any specific countries you point out in one direction or the other relative the overall growth rate of the business when we get back to that kind of normal period of time again?  And then secondly, I know you just divested a number of businesses, but valuations of companies that could be bolted on to the platform has changed considerably just in the past few months. And I'm curious if the environment change has made you more open to considering acquisitions within the marketplace category.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So Scott, this is Jamie. So on the U.S. versus international, as we talked about last quarter, there's a couple of dynamics that are impacting the differences in the growth rate. First, on the macro side, just different markets, GDP growth, inflation growth, retail growth are different and lower in Europe than what we're seeing in the U.S. We've talked about the supply chain challenges, which have a bigger impact on our international business than on our U.S. business. So in some cases in the U.S., we're favored by it in things like video graphics cards, which are in high demand.  At the same time, we have a strong cross-border trade business, and some of our sellers are impacted by some of the supply chain dynamics and export challenges. And that hits our international segment more than our U.S. segment.  The third component is really the focus categories are much more nascent in our international business than in the U.S. So think a category like watches, which has been live for several quarters in the U.S., we just rolled that out to U.K. and Germany this quarter, ditto with some of our other products and focus categories where they're still rolling it off to our international markets. And as we've seen, it takes a few quarters for us to achieve the growth rate levels that we saw in the U.S. But we believe that, that playbook will apply and that will help the convergence that you talked about.  The last thing is really just the collectible difference between the 2 markets. Trading cards and that whole segment is stronger in the U.S. than it is in international. So it's a long way to say that there's a number of factors that are at play there. But yes, we believe, over time, as the categories roll out, that will drive the convergence as well as some of the macro effects like the supply chain and other pieces change over time.  On your second question on M&A, yes, we continue to look at M&A as an opportunity to accelerate our tech-led reimagination. We've said we will be opportunistic to look at areas that are asset-light and consistent with our business to drive the strategy that we've laid out. The example I would point to is, most recently, Sneaker Con and that investment with authentication properties and services in 5 different countries enabling us to accelerate even faster what's happening on sneakers, where we've seen really great success. In fact, we think the playbook has worked well enough now that we're actually remonetizing sneakers this quarter for sneakers over $100. So it gives us scale, and it gives us flexibility, and that was the point of the acquisition.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Just following up from Scott's question. I think looking at the exit run rate for '22, some investors we talked to, I think, were hoping to see a little bit more than 2% to 3% GMV growth with all the focus category activity and initiatives that you're working on. So I guess why aren't we seeing higher growth once we kind of hit the easier comp period? Are we still cleaning up some of the lower-quality buyers? Anything that you would call out in terms of why that growth rate isn't quite up to the e-commerce averages at the end of '22?  And then, Steve, you mentioned new opportunities in managed payments now that we're 100% covered. Just can you elaborate a little bit on what you guys are going to potentially roll out in payments, that would be great.\nStephen Priest: Ross, Steve here. Thank you for the questions. I think the thing I would say is that we've made a very significant progress in our growth at eBay over the last couple of years. As you recall, prior to the pandemic, as we left 2019, the overall 2019, the business was shrinking, minus 2. We actually exited 2019 at minus 4. And as we've gone through the pandemic, we've made the right investments, we've really driven the tech-led reimagination and really driven our focus category playbook, which is working very, very effectively.  As you sort of cycle through the pandemic, as we've said, the second half of the year -- the first half, we obviously are lapping very significant mobility challenges associated with the pandemic last year. As we come through the first half and get into the second half, it is obviously the cleanest comps that we've got from the pandemic. But we've always said over the last couple of years, the tech-led reimagination is a multiyear process. I'm delighted with the progress that we've made. The momentum is working. We're going category by category. And as we said, we're exiting the year in the -- well, our expectations to exit the year at sort of 2% to 3% growth.  The thing with the focus categories, I'd also like to add, is that those areas that we've lent into are growing at about 15 points higher than the rest of the platform. And so again, it's very, very clear that strategy is working, and it will continue to take some time.  The second thing I would talk about is obviously on managed payments. Magnificent work by the team. Very proud of what was achieved in 2021. I would describe it as being the end of the beginning. We completed the transition, enabled us to drive a seamless experience for our customers, both from a commerce standpoint and a payments standpoint, gives us the opportunity to eliminate things like UPIs or unpaid items, which is continuing to take friction away from the platform and increase trust.  But again, we have opportunities as we go forward. I'm really excited that we have the opportunity to have Julie Loeger, who is leading our payments platform and the initiatives going forward, who will be joining us at our investor event on the 10th of March, who will be sharing with us our longer-term strategy, and I'm looking forward to you dialing in and seeing us on the 10th of March.\nOperator: Moving on, your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Jamie, your seller base has always been SMBs and individuals. And it seems like the ad products that seem to be fairly popular with smaller advertisers are those that are doing a lot of that automating of spend for them. So some sellers may be pretty savvy, and they might want to do -- manage the campaigns on their own, but I would imagine more folks would probably rather have eBay do the spending for them. So can you talk about where you may be in terms of simplifying PLAs for your sellers to expand the adoption rate? And expanding on that do-it-for-me theme, can you talk about where you may be in terms of the adoption rate for your external Promoted Listings product?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So thanks for the question. So we agree with you. So we think the benefit of having multiple advertising products is to appeal to not only multiple types of sellers but multiple types of advertising occasions. So we built our first $1 billion business over the last 5 years on a single product, which is a CPA-based product. And we've introduced 3 new products: Express, which is a fixed price, easy-to-understand product; external, which is really just an opt-in product for our external promoter listings, so that one is pretty straightforward: and then Advanced, which is actually a quite sophisticated product for SMBs, ones that are more used to keyword bidding, campaigns, daily budget levels, CPC amounts, et cetera.  And so what I would say is that we're happy because the CPA-based product, our product that's out there for 5 years, is actually a pretty easy product and a low-risk product, meaning, I only pay when I sell the product from that perspective. But we're also excited that the new products actually round out the portfolio of opportunities to drive advertisement.  The Advanced ones like CPC are still in a nascent stage. So we're still in a limited beta with those products. And it's really -- it'll take time just like it did for multi-years with the CPA to build the optimization, to drive trial, to drive adoption, et cetera. But exactly what you said is why we have the portfolio of products. And yes, we continue to look at ways to leverage artificial intelligence and other things to make not only the products easier for sellers to adopt, but also make them more effective in terms of the ROAS or the return on ad spend that we're seeing. Thus far, we've been really pleased with the ROAS that sellers are getting and shows us that there's continued opportunity in our advertising portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.\nJohn Blackledge: Two questions. First, on the focus categories based on the current GMV guide. Do you expect the focus categories to sustain that growth differential -- the 15% differential versus non-focus categories in fiscal '22? And then second question on margin/investments. The 1Q '22 op margin is a bit higher than the '22 op margin guide, and you cited some investments. Could you discuss the investment spend that's kind of being phased in throughout '22?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So I'll start with the first one, and then, Steve, you can take the margin question. So on the focus category, yes, over time, we will be adding additional focus categories. Our next one is parts and accessories. And that category is a very large category on eBay, one where we come in from a position of strength. Especially in the U.K. and Germany, we have a market-leading position. There are some differences. Trading cards had a very strong year in '21. And so thus far, the category is performing well. But overall, I would say, yes, we think that the focus categories will continue to maintain a significant margin to the rest of the business.  And frankly, it's why we're excited and why we're investing, to your second question. If I just back up and take sneakers. Sneakers have been declining for 3 years, John, at double digits. We invested in the category. We've built critical specific marketing campaigns. We built an A+ experience that had over 90 customer satisfaction. And what you saw there is that the business really took off. We grew triple digits a year ago, still doing double digits in that business. And in fact, the category is still healthy now that we're actually remonetizing it. So we just reintroduced monetization over $100 for sneakers. And that's part of the investment that we're looking to do in '22 is to continue to roll out this winning formula that we have in the playbook to additional categories.\nStephen Priest: John, Steve here. So let me just give you a little bit of color on the overall margin position as we've guided the full year margin for 2022 of 30% to 31%. There's a number of items at play here. Number one, we've got volume deleverage that's happening in the overall business as we cycle through the lapping of the pandemic, which is much more significant in the first half, as you can imagine. Secondly, as we sort of lap the payments transition that we went through, that's also a dilutionary effect.  On the flip side, we have been doing a lot of work on our operational efficiency and going deep on our cost structure to identify opportunities to take cost out of the business to enable us to go forward with reinvestment.  And then finally, we have been, as Jamie said, really delighted with the trajectory that we've had with regard to our focus categories. Think about sneakers, think about watches, think about the 15% -- 15-point increase over the core platform. And that's been a result of investments that we have made to really change the tide and turn the tide on the focus category we've had. So we're going to be leaning in to product. We're going to be leaning into full funnel marketing as we go category by category in '22. So it continues to be an investment year as we go forward.  Q2 will be the lowest point of the margin for the year when, firstly, we do continue to lap through that significant COVID lapping from last year, but also the phasing of the investments as they start to ramp in the second quarter and ramp through the rest of the year as we go forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a shape of the macro picture, but also the shape of margin trajectory as we go through 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe a multi-parter on buyers that sort of dovetails with some of the questions you've gotten so far. If we were to compartmentalize buyer growth going forward, how should we be thinking about the headwinds you're facing in sort of a post-pandemic environment, elements where you yourself are not choosing buyer growth and where there could be tailwinds to buyer growth from some of the new verticalized experiences you're trying to build out for the platform over the medium to long term? So sort of -- I don't know if there's a way to sort of characterize it that way, but if we were to think about those 3 buckets and elements of headwinds and tailwinds and how it feeds back in to thinking about buyer growth going forward.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, on high-value buyers, we've talked about the shift in strategy where back in 2019, we were focused on the total number of active buyers. And I've refocused the organization since last July on this idea of turning buyers into enthusiasts and really focusing on our high-value buyers. High-value buyers, if you look at it, are really made up of 2 groups, buyers who sell and then high-value buyers, buyers who buy over $800 and shop 6 times a year. When we look at high-value buyers in total this quarter, they're up 3% year on 2 year, whereas our low-value buyers are down 9% year on 2 year. So this is a very conscious strategy to not do low ASP couponing and some of the stuff that we were doing.  To your question, both of -- these metrics for buyers are trailing 12-metric -- 12-month metric. So what we're seeing is a slight deceleration from the infrequent sellers, and that's something that we had planned to see and will likely see for coming quarters in some time period. But the second group, the enthusiast buyers, is growing. And in fact, their spend is growing more each quarter so that it grew again this quarter. We call those our enthusiast buyers. I've met a lot of these enthusiast buyers, right? They wake up. They grab a cup of coffee, and they open up the eBay app. They shop eBay across multiple categories. And when you look at their spend, it's a very healthy spend level, right, $2,000-plus.  So what we're going to be focused on is things like driving the cross-category shopping nature of those buyers. And so take watches, for example, when we acquire a watch buyer, we'll get them to spend $9,000 in watches, but they'll go on to spend $7,000 in other categories. So we get this multiplier effect on eBay from being able to acquire somebody into a category and having them spend across the vast breadth that we offer.  So you'll see different patterns over time. We'll continue to see some deceleration from these infrequent sellers. And quarter-to-quarter, we may see some changes in high-value buyers. But overall, when we look at the trajectory of what we're doing is we're making the business a whole lot healthier by focusing on this group, getting to go cross-category and, frankly, acquiring enthusiasts right into our focus categories. That's the strategy that we'll have, and we'll go into more detail on Investor Day on March 10 on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Maybe two for me as well. A follow-up, Jamie, on the comments around sustainable growth and focus categories. Is P&A the only incremental vertical category change embedded in the guidance for the first half? And beyond easier comps then, does the second half growth outlook include other category enhancements you haven't really talked about yet?  And then maybe, Steve, secondly, there were some changes to seller pricing announced recently. I wonder if you could perhaps unpack the size of that impact from those changes in the take rate and how that flows through the year in terms of the guidance.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So as you've seen, Colin, I don't like to talk about where we're going next for competitive reasons and kind of giving away what is our next focus area. So the other one that we've announced is going after parts and accessories next as a large category dominant market leader position and a great opportunity for us. We talked about investment. You're starting to see full funnel marketing from what we're doing in parts and accessories from a leading position as well as a number of product changes like opening up our global category structure to make it easier to do cross-border trade business, putting all of our parts into the vehicles apps, et cetera. And so we'll go into a lot more depth on Investor Day at what we're seeing in the focus categories that we worked on and our path forward, but that's all that we've announced up until this point.\nStephen Priest: Colin, thanks for the question. I'll talk about take rate. So just as a reminder, our take rate is ballparked around 12%, but 8 to that final value feed, 3 on payments, 1 on ads. There is a little bit of -- there's a number of items that we're going through as we go through the trajectory of 2022. The first thing is that we're obviously starting to lap payments. And so some of that trajectory that we saw grow significantly as we went through 2021 will plateau off. We're obviously continuing to see some of the ads momentum that Jamie sort of alluded to earlier. And then there's obviously puts and takes in terms of category mix and category pricing as we go forward.  In the prepared comments, we talked about an incremental 1 point of take rate as we go through 2022, and that's primarily going to be a result of the payments rollout for the full year effect as we go forward.  The other thing I would say is that we continue to drive great value for our sellers. If you think about prior to payments rollout, we actually brought the combined take rate down as a result of going through managed payments. So we still create and offer extremely good value for our sellers as we go forward and eBay being the platform of choice for those great sellers as we go forward.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. A good example of that is in sneakers, right? So I talked about us remonetizing sneakers for sneakers over $100. We're still a great value for buyers and sellers versus other places that they can sell and buy sneakers. So we feel great about that. And that's the feedback that we've gotten from the community. We'll continue to make other smart changes like we did in parts and accessories, in watches and in certain categories constantly with this viewpoint of how do we provide the right value for our sellers on the platform to make sure we're bringing the best inventory on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEdward Yruma: Two quick ones for me. I guess, first, to the extent you could talk about it, with some of these changes in the pricing structures as a follow-up to the last question, do you see any adverse impact in terms of the number of sellers or the performance level when you reprice some of these categories tactically? And then as a follow-up to that, as you look across the rest of the portfolio, do you think that there are other opportunities for you to take price given the strong momentum the platform has?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So in general, we obviously studied the elasticity quite a bit. And what I was saying about sneakers is true, which is we're maintaining a double-digit growth in that category. And relative to other places that they can sell their sneakers, we're still very economical and the best value for doing so. So we always look at the elasticity, what's our opportunity to bring more demand. In certain cases, we do, for example, C2C promotions to bring sellers onto the platform in our various markets. But we're kind of rebalanced obviously being a great value for our sellers and our, ultimately, monetization.  I'd probably point you back, Ed, to what Steve said about advertising, which is the main vector for us in terms of driving monetization across the board and increasing the take rate. Other than that, we're really just looking at category by category and making sure that we're competitive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion from Piper Sandler.\nThomas Champion: Jamie, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact on buyer activity from video content and video added to listings. And then, Steve, maybe just a quick one for you. Not to beat a dead horse on managed payments and the take rate, but notice the transaction take rate remained flat quarter-over-quarter. 3Q to 4Q, all else equal, I would think that would go up a little bit. Is that kind of evidence of offering a discount or lower core transaction take rate in some categories or a function of mix? Just curious if you could discuss that result a little bit.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Tom. So on the videos, what I would say it's very, very early days. So we just rolled out the feature. Excited about it from 2 elements, though. One is excited for our eBay store sellers that they can now build a video to tell their story. One of the unique parts of eBay is it's not just a transactional model. So if you look at some of these models, your brand doesn't meet a whole lot. At eBay, we let the seller really build the brand and have access to 160 million buyers. And so that, I think, will be really powerful as more and more sellers adopt it.  The same thing is true for our listings and bringing video across the platform. One is it just makes the engagement of the platform much more compelling. I think about an oboe I recently bought them a platform of 2 quarters ago from my daughter. It was great, lots of pictures and lots of description, but god, a video and being able to hear it would have been even more compelling. You could think about that in a lot of categories.  So it's really early days. We're just adopting it for our API-based sellers and moving into our core listing flows. But we think over the coming quarters and years, it'll be an exciting new element for us on eBay.\nStephen Priest: Tom, with regards to the payments take rate, great question. What I'd say is we were essentially complete as we entered the fourth quarter of last year with regards to the payments migration, as we talked about. Fantastic work by the team. And so on the basis of that and the fact that, as you put it, you got a bit of seasonality in there and category mix. So nothing to see there. It's just a function of those two items.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: A little bit about growth in preowned, particularly among young buyers and the sustainability push across the company. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the sustainability vision, how that aligns with your younger buyer cohorts, anything you could tell us about kind of brand awareness and association with that sustainability focus among younger users, growth in those younger cohorts.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Great. So even really pioneered e-commerce, and I think the strategy we laid out last July of leaning into e-commerce, is leaning into right where the next generation is going. And I'm really happy because not only leading into where Gen Z is, but we're keeping products in circulation, keeping them out of the landfill.  We did a survey recently, and 87% of respondents said they had sold preowned goods in the last 12 months. And it's really important to Gen Z because it plays a huge role in their experience. 81% of Gen Z said that buying preowned items has become more common for them in the last year. So we feel great from a business perspective, but also from an ESG perspective.  If you think about what e-commerce does, we just made the Dow Jones Sustainability World in North America indices for the third year in a row. I talked about some of the other recognition that we had as an organization. We've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of emissions, just in apparel and preloved electronics. So from an ESG standpoint, we think ESG is so core to what eBay does, that we should be in every ESG fund. So both from a business and an ESG standpoint, we think we're leaning into a great vector of growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights from the quarter and full year on Slide 4 of our investor presentation. Next, I'll walk through key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our forward outlook and closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.  Overall, we are pleased with our Q4 results as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics, capping off an exceptional 2021 for eBay. I've been inspired by our team's relentless focus and execution amid uncertain economic and operating conditions throughout the year. Importantly, our performance in 2021 demonstrated the progress we have made towards a return to durable, sustainable growth in the years ahead.  Revenue grew 5% to $2.6 billion in Q4, over 15 points faster than volume growth. For 2021, revenue grew 15% to $10.4 billion, up 18 points faster than volume growth. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter. For the full year, we generated approximately $3.5 billion of operating profit at 33.4% margin. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $1.05 in Q4. For the full year, EPS grew 21% to $4.02. We generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in 2021 and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  Let's take a deeper look into our key operating and financial metrics. As a reminder, we adjusted our definition of GMV in December following the completion of our payments migration. The change had a modest impact on our historical GMV and active buyer figures, but the impact of the change on year-over-year growth for each metric in Q4 was immaterial.  Starting with active buyers. We ended 2021 with 147 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 9% year-over-year decline. The expected decrease in active buyers was primarily driven by low value buyers, which fell 9% versus Q4 of 2019. Growth in high-value buyers over the same period was 3%. Although fewer buyers sold on eBay as compared to prepandemic levels, total high-value buyers were up due to growth in high spending and [indiscernible]. And importantly, even as mobility restrictions have been lifted, spend for high-value buyer continues to expand at healthy rates.  Our buyers purchased $20.7 billion of GMV in Q4, which marked an 11% decline and landed near the high end of our outlook. Compared with Q4 of 2019, GMV grew 9% at constant currency, representing a 3-point deceleration sequentially. On a geographic basis, U.S. GMV grew 22% versus Q4 of 2019, while international GMV declined 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Our U.S. and international markets were impacted by softness in overall online shopping activity during the Cyber Five holiday period, but both geographies improved during the remainder of December.  Consistent with prior quarters, numerous factors contributed to the growth differential between our U.S. and international markets. Core macroeconomic factors like GDP, retail growth and inflation have been notably stronger in the U.S. than our international markets. Other macro factors like global supply chain disruptions, shipping constraints and other export challenges have had a negative impact on growth in our international markets. These dynamics have particularly impacted sellers involved in cross-border trade, which skew towards non-U.S. markets.  Conversely, our domestic sellers likely benefited from item scarcity due to supply changes. Our domestic GMV has benefited from momentum in collectibles, which is largely a U.S. phenomenon. In addition, high ASP luxury categories are growing faster in the U.S. as the rollout of our innovation playbook is more nascent internationally. However, as our luxury categories build momentum and we roll out product improvements in categories like P&A, which represents a higher share of GMV in international markets, growth outside the U.S. should see greater benefit.  Our focus category coverage expanded to approximately 20% of GMV as we made product improvements in P&A and broadened our country footprint in existing luxury categories. Focus categories outpaced growth in other categories by approximately 15 points in Q4, demonstrating the impact of our innovation playbook.  Net revenue during the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 5%, while transaction revenue also grew 5%. Under our updated definition of GMV, our transaction take rate of 11.8% was roughly in line with Q3 as we completed the managed payments migration. Managed payments contributed 15 points of revenue growth in Q4 and generated $2 billion of incremental revenue in 2021, meeting our full year target. We remain excited about the potential for managed payments to open up new opportunities in financial services for our sellers and buyers.  Within our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 4% during the quarter, outpacing volume by 15 points. As Jamie noted, we are encouraged by the progress of our new ad products, which began to gradually move the needle from Promoted Listings growth during the quarter.  Moving down the P&L. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31.6%. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, increasing by close to 200 basis points versus 2019. This leverage was particularly notable given the incremental contribution from managed payments, which generates material operating profit, but is dilutive to reporting operating margins.  Cost of revenue rose by over 4 points as a percentage of revenue in Q4 year-over-year due to the variable payment processing costs from managed payments. With the migration behind us, we expect gross margin to stabilize around the current run rate in the short term with normal seasonal fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. Our other operating expenses declined by over 4 points in aggregate, roughly offsetting the decline in gross margin as payments revenue post fewer fixed expenses.  Turning to earnings per share. During the quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, up 24%. Contributions from payments and advertising in conjunction with share repurchases offset the lapping of mobility tailwinds last year. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $1.47 due primarily to mark-to-market losses on our investment portfolio. We generated $372 million of free cash flow in Q4 and ended the year with cash and non-equity investments of $7.3 billion as well as gross debt of $9.1 billion. We repurchased $3 billion of shares during Q4, an average price of approximately $70 per share, with the majority of our buyback executed through accelerated share repurchase programs. Additional ASR details will be available in our 10-K filing. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $107 million in December, representing $0.18 per share.  Our investments are detailed on Slide 13. After closing our Permira and Korea deals, which yielded approximately $5 billion in cash, our remaining investment portfolio was worth over $8 billion in aggregate at the end of Q4. Our remaining Adevinta shares were valued at $5.4 billion. We held approximately $1.1 billion of Adyen shares after exercising our first tranche of warrants during Q4. Including the estimated value of our remaining warrant tranches, our total Adyen investment amounted to $1.5 billion. Our stake in KakaoBank was worth roughly $700 million. And finally, the fair value of our nearly 20% ownership interest in Gmarket in Korea was approximately $700 million.  Moving to our outlook, beginning with the full year on Slide 14. To summarize, 2022 will be the tale of 2 halves. During the first half of the year, we'll lap significant mobility and macro tailwinds from 2021, with margins pressured as we scale investments sequentially. During the second half, we should observe the cleanest year-over-year comps we've encountered since entering the pandemic, revealing the underlying growth and earnings power of our business.  For the full year, we forecast GMV to decline by 5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis, with an FX headwind of roughly 200 to 300 basis points to reported growth. We anticipate the GMV decline in the mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis during the first half as we lap a period of significant global mobility restrictions and the U.S. stimulus effects. In the second half, we expect flat to modestly positive GMV growth and anticipate exiting the year growing volume at 2% to 3% in constant currency. Notably, the quarterly phasing of our GMV should more closely approximate prepandemic seasonality moving forward, assuming mobility and macro factors remain relatively stable throughout the year.  We expect our 2022 take rate to expand by roughly 1 point driven primarily by a full year of managed payments and increased revenue contribution from Promoted Listings as we scale our new products. We forecast 2022 revenue of $10.3 billion to $10.5 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of flat to positive 3%. During the first half, we expect revenues to decline in the low to mid-single digits before reaccelerating in the second half to go in the mid- to high single digits in constant currency.  As we exit Q4, we expect the relationship between revenue and GMV to tighten as we fully lap the managed payments rollout. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of between 30% and 31% this year. The second quarter should mark the low point for margins during the year as we lap difficult comps and ramp up our pace of investment. Our investments in focus categories last year had a measurable positive impact on growth. Thus, we are doubling down on investments in products and full funnel marketing initiatives in 2022, supporting these categories. We're confident these investments will improve customer satisfaction rates and drive sustainable growth in the years ahead.  We forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $4.20 and $4.40 in 2022. During the first half of the year, we expect EPS to be down low single digits year-over-year as we lap last year's outstanding growth and scale investments. However, the midpoint of our outlook implies EPS will grow in the high teens during the second half as GMV turns positive and revenue outpaces volume.  Our Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion, bringing our total authorization to approximately $6 billion. We are also raising our quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.22 per share, our third consecutive double-digit raise since establishing our dividend in 2019.  Looking at the first quarter guidance on Slide 15. We forecast revenue between $2.43 billion and $2.48 billion, representing a decline between 5% and 7% at constant currency. We expect our take rate to be roughly stable sequentially, implying GMV is down 17% to 19% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margins between 31.5% and 32% in Q1, up modestly versus Q4 at the midpoint, but down 5 to 6 points year-over-year as we lap extraordinary volume leverage last year due to COVID. We project non-GAAP EPS between $1.01 and $1.05 in Q1, representing a year-over-year decline of 6% to a decline of 3%.  In closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for eBay. We delivered strong Q4 and full year results despite a challenging operating environment, uncertain macro conditions and constantly changing consumer behavior throughout the pandemic. Our focus categories meaningfully outpace overall volume growth due to increased customer satisfaction rates, offering demonstrable proof that our innovation playbook is working.  We generated $2 billion of revenue from managed payments this year after completing our migration and still see many more opportunities to leverage financial services to reduce friction for sellers and buyers on eBay. We delivered over $1 billion of advertising revenue this year and significantly broadened our ad portfolio to meet the needs of more sellers, helping them grow their businesses on eBay.  We've made prudent investments in people, product and technology to support our strategic pillars. We believe these investments will drive durable growth in our marketplace in the years ahead. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 21% on top of strong earnings growth in the prior year, generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, unlocked billions more from our portfolio divestitures and returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  We are proud to have taken meaningful steps to improve our environmental impact this year by achieving 100% carbon neutrality, setting ambitious science-based targets for the future and the continuous progress we are making as we focus on driving e-commerce and the circular economy as a whole.  I would like to echo Jamie's thanks to our incredible employee base as their tireless efforts have been instrumental in bringing our strategy to life. To our valued sellers and buyers in the eBay community, your response to our investments in trust and innovation give us conviction that we are on the right path. We are excited to reveal more details about our future road map very soon.  To the investment community, we appreciate your continued interest and look forward to hosting you at our virtual Investor Day on March 10.  With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator? Ross, Steve here. Thank you for the questions. I think the thing I would say is that we've made a very significant progress in our growth at eBay over the last couple of years. As you recall, prior to the pandemic, as we left 2019, the overall 2019, the business was shrinking, minus 2. We actually exited 2019 at minus 4. And as we've gone through the pandemic, we've made the right investments, we've really driven the tech-led reimagination and really driven our focus category playbook, which is working very, very effectively.  As you sort of cycle through the pandemic, as we've said, the second half of the year -- the first half, we obviously are lapping very significant mobility challenges associated with the pandemic last year. As we come through the first half and get into the second half, it is obviously the cleanest comps that we've got from the pandemic. But we've always said over the last couple of years, the tech-led reimagination is a multiyear process. I'm delighted with the progress that we've made. The momentum is working. We're going category by category. And as we said, we're exiting the year in the -- well, our expectations to exit the year at sort of 2% to 3% growth.  The thing with the focus categories, I'd also like to add, is that those areas that we've lent into are growing at about 15 points higher than the rest of the platform. And so again, it's very, very clear that strategy is working, and it will continue to take some time.  The second thing I would talk about is obviously on managed payments. Magnificent work by the team. Very proud of what was achieved in 2021. I would describe it as being the end of the beginning. We completed the transition, enabled us to drive a seamless experience for our customers, both from a commerce standpoint and a payments standpoint, gives us the opportunity to eliminate things like UPIs or unpaid items, which is continuing to take friction away from the platform and increase trust.  But again, we have opportunities as we go forward. I'm really excited that we have the opportunity to have Julie Loeger, who is leading our payments platform and the initiatives going forward, who will be joining us at our investor event on the 10th of March, who will be sharing with us our longer-term strategy, and I'm looking forward to you dialing in and seeing us on the 10th of March. John, Steve here. So let me just give you a little bit of color on the overall margin position as we've guided the full year margin for 2022 of 30% to 31%. There's a number of items at play here. Number one, we've got volume deleverage that's happening in the overall business as we cycle through the lapping of the pandemic, which is much more significant in the first half, as you can imagine. Secondly, as we sort of lap the payments transition that we went through, that's also a dilutionary effect.  On the flip side, we have been doing a lot of work on our operational efficiency and going deep on our cost structure to identify opportunities to take cost out of the business to enable us to go forward with reinvestment.  And then finally, we have been, as Jamie said, really delighted with the trajectory that we've had with regard to our focus categories. Think about sneakers, think about watches, think about the 15% -- 15-point increase over the core platform. And that's been a result of investments that we have made to really change the tide and turn the tide on the focus category we've had. So we're going to be leaning in to product. We're going to be leaning into full funnel marketing as we go category by category in '22. So it continues to be an investment year as we go forward.  Q2 will be the lowest point of the margin for the year when, firstly, we do continue to lap through that significant COVID lapping from last year, but also the phasing of the investments as they start to ramp in the second quarter and ramp through the rest of the year as we go forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a shape of the macro picture, but also the shape of margin trajectory as we go through 2022. Colin, thanks for the question. I'll talk about take rate. So just as a reminder, our take rate is ballparked around 12%, but 8 to that final value feed, 3 on payments, 1 on ads. There is a little bit of -- there's a number of items that we're going through as we go through the trajectory of 2022. The first thing is that we're obviously starting to lap payments. And so some of that trajectory that we saw grow significantly as we went through 2021 will plateau off. We're obviously continuing to see some of the ads momentum that Jamie sort of alluded to earlier. And then there's obviously puts and takes in terms of category mix and category pricing as we go forward.  In the prepared comments, we talked about an incremental 1 point of take rate as we go through 2022, and that's primarily going to be a result of the payments rollout for the full year effect as we go forward.  The other thing I would say is that we continue to drive great value for our sellers. If you think about prior to payments rollout, we actually brought the combined take rate down as a result of going through managed payments. So we still create and offer extremely good value for our sellers as we go forward and eBay being the platform of choice for those great sellers as we go forward. Tom, with regards to the payments take rate, great question. What I'd say is we were essentially complete as we entered the fourth quarter of last year with regards to the payments migration, as we talked about. Fantastic work by the team. And so on the basis of that and the fact that, as you put it, you got a bit of seasonality in there and category mix. So nothing to see there. It's just a function of those two items."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll begin by sharing highlights since our last earnings call. Then I will focus on the near-term progress we are making towards our strategic vision. And finally, provide a short preview of our Investor Day in 2 weeks. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.  The fourth quarter marked another solid quarter for sellers and buyers on eBay. They benefited from investments in our strategy to drive sustainable growth in our marketplace. We are simplifying the seller and buyer experience, increasing customer satisfaction and improving our underlying growth trajectory.  Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. We are seeing faster GMV growth in focus categories that now represent approximately 20% of global volume. We successfully completed our multiyear payments transition on time with more customer benefits and with greater financial impact than expected. Our advertising business grew faster than marketplace volume as more sellers adopted new ad products. We delivered revenue growth at the high end of our expectations and earnings growth above guidance. And finally, we continue to execute our ESG agenda. In addition to being carbon-neutral, we made progress on our long-term sustainability targets, and eBay for Charity finished a record-breaking year.  I'm very pleased with our Q4 financial results. We delivered 5% revenue growth on the back of payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, more than the high end of expectations. For the full year, revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 21%.  As proud as I am of our team for delivering these results, I am more excited about eBay's future based on the response from our customers to the strategy we are implementing. This is evident in focused categories. We are delivering best-in-class customer satisfaction, and it is leading to faster GMV growth. In Q4, focus categories grew 15 points faster than the rest of the marketplace.  The next category we are focused on is motors, parts and accessories or P&A for short. This is one of our largest categories globally and is full of enthusiasts who are passionate about what they trade on eBay. Many are very active buyers who shop in multiple categories, with over 60% of the eBay spend coming on products outside P&A.  Starting in December, we began investing in top-of-funnel marketing across TV, radio and social sales in partnership with key industry influencers. These ads highlight the valuable choices P&A enthusiasts have on eBay across hundreds of millions of listings. In addition, we implemented monetization changes to higher-priced items and saw an increase in listings during Q4.  We are leveraging the scale of our supply in new ways. With input from our P&A sellers, we simplified our global category structure. This makes it easier for buyers to find unique parts from around the world, unlocking more cross-border trade. These initial changes led to modestly better performance in P&A GMV during Q4 relative to the overall business. It's early days, and we plan to make further investments this year to improve our trajectory in this category.  In focus categories where we have been investing for several quarters, we have seen growth sustained at higher levels. Sneakers over $100 continued to grow double digits globally. Our success in the U.S. is being replicated in other major markets. Part of that success is authentication, which is scaled to 5 countries over the past year. And in Q4, we started authenticating cross-border transactions into the U.S.  But we are not stopping there. Last quarter, we acquired Sneaker Con, a leading authenticator with operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and Germany. By bringing additional capacity in-house, we increased the scale and flexibility of our operations. We also introduced 3D true view on select listings. This capability increases trust for buyers shopping for unique, high-value pre-owned items.  Given our success in driving customer satisfaction to over 90% and sustained double-digit GMV growth, we have reintroduced monetization in the U.S. for sneakers over $100. The initial customer feedback has been encouraging as sellers continue to benefit from a lower take rate than many other platforms. Sellers are also listing more luxury watches on eBay. We saw a double-digit increase in supply quarter-over-quarter, and total GMV in this category continues to grow at strong double-digit rates in the U.S.  In Germany and the U.K., authentication is also leading to higher customer satisfaction. In luxury handbags, we saw acceleration in Q4 to positive double-digit growth in the U.S. Based on the success of authenticity guarantee, we are growing the number of brands covered by the program. In addition, we have expanded selection by authenticating cross-border imports from Japan, a key source of unique inventory. And just a few weeks ago, we announced authenticity guarantee for all single ungraded trading cards sold for over $750 in the U.S. We plan to expand this offering to include graded autograph and pass cars sold for more than $250 later this year.  As we exited 2021, our Certified Refurbished program had expanded to over 320 brands. This program now includes brands like Microsoft, Dyson, Samsung Galaxy and KitchenAid. And as a reminder, these products are certified by the manufacturer, are like new and are backed by a 2-year warranty and eBay's money back guarantee. Higher trust has increased customer satisfaction and accelerated GMV to positive double-digit rates. Certified Refurbished products from top brands make up a small percentage of the total refurb activity on eBay but are growing significantly faster. This has inspired us to expand further. And in November, we announced eBay Refurbished, a destination for like new products. This expanded experience adds more inventory from top-rated sellers. These trusted sellers are thoroughly vetted to meet rigorous performance standards so buyers can purchase with even greater confidence.  In Q4, we saw promising early results from this expansion in mobile phones and plan to extend to tablets, smart watches and laptops this year.  In addition to improvements in focus categories, we made a number of changes during Q4 that benefited sellers and buyers across all categories globally. We've started a pilot with our API sellers to add video to their listings. To date, we have seen hundreds of thousands of listings add video content. Buyers get a rich shopping experience on individual item pages and in seller stores. Looking ahead, we plan to enable more sellers to tell their story by adding videos through additional listing flows.  Another new growth capability we are scaling for sellers is coded coupons. Since launch, sellers have realized over $350 million in GMV. Over 60,000 sellers have driven repeat purchases from almost 6 million buyers. Buyer trust is essential in a third-party marketplace and is an area of focus for our technology investment.  In Q4, we leveraged artificial intelligence to significantly decrease the time to detect and remove counterfeits. In the categories where it has been deployed to date, most listings are renewed before a buyer has a chance to see it. These are a few recent examples of how we are using technology to increase trust while simplifying seller and buyer experiences.  Moving on to payments. In Q4, we completed the transition to a modern payments platform by migrating all remaining sellers away from the legacy system. This has resulted in a simpler seller experience, lower fees for most sellers, more choice for buyers and better-than-expected financial results. Although this marks the culmination of a major multiyear effort, in reality, this is just the beginning. By managing seller and buyer money flows, we can remove transactional friction and provide more trusted services. We've been systematically eliminating unpaid items, which removed friction for approximately 10 million transactions in 2021. In addition, sellers are being paid faster for weekend sales in most major markets.  We are also exploring new ways to allow sellers and buyers to benefit from our scale. In the U.S., we recently launched a partnership with Chase Freedom rewards that increases top-of-funnel impressions, driving buyer traffic to eBay. We are excited by the value payments has provided our seller and buyer community, and we see more growth opportunities ahead.  Moving to advertising. In Q4, ad revenue growth once again outpaced volume due to Promoted Listings, driving approximately $227 million in revenue, up 4%. Adoption grew at double-digit rates in both the number of sellers and the number of listings promoted. Looking at the full year, our advertising business, including both first-party and third-party ad products, surpassed $1 billion, up 9%. To drive the next growth cycle in advertising, we expanded the rollout of new products to more sellers and markets during the quarter.  PL Express, our auction listings product, was fully launched to all major markets. We also integrated this feature into more listing tools to drive further adoption. For PL Advanced, our cost per click offering, we opened access to AI-driven recommendations for keywords and bid pricing. While this product remains in a limited beta as we optimize the customer experience, we are increasing exposure and streamlining reporting for sellers.  For external Promoted Listings, we continue to ramp more affiliate traffic through the eBay partner network. We also increased traffic from external paid search to Promoted Listings in European markets. Participating sellers are seeing increased traffic and conversion while maintaining control over ad pricing.  We have carefully meted the rollout out of these new products while balancing impacts to our buyer experience. Despite the limited release, new ad products provide a material contribution to Promoted Listings revenue growth in Q4. We expect this to accelerate in the coming quarters as availability and adoption of these new product increases.  Another area where we made significant progress last year was in e-commerce. Volume of pre-loved products grew faster than new products in 2021 driven by demand from younger consumers. For the full year, we delivered $2.7 billion of GMV in pre-loved electronics and apparel in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.  In addition to providing customers great value on unique used goods, e-commerce activity also helped to meet our sustainability goals. These purchases reduced carbon emissions by approximately 540,000 metric tons in 2021. eBay is a carbon-neutral company, and I'm thrilled by the recognition we recently received as a sustainability leader in e-commerce.  For the third year running, eBay has made the Dow Jones Sustainability World in North American indices, putting us in the top 10% of companies in our industry globally. eBay was also included in Just Capital and CNBC's Just 100 list. This list measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. When compared to nearly 1,000 companies, eBay ranked 88th overall and fourth in retail when it comes to minimizing our environmental impact. I'm really proud of the progress our team is making here.  The eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity. In Q4, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise almost $37 million, up 6%. And for the year, customers raised over $145 million, up 18%, the most raised since we started this program almost 20 years ago.  Lastly, we were honored this year to receive Glassdoor's 2022 Employees' Choice Award. This award reflects anonymous feedback from current and former employees regarding topics such as crew opportunities, culture and values, and diversity inclusion, just to name a few. We are truly honored to be recognized by the people who make eBay the company it is.  Now I would like to talk about our upcoming Investor Day on March 10. In July of 2020, I outlined a clear vision of a winning strategy for the company. Since that time, we increased our focus on sellers and buyers, accelerated the pace of innovation, simplified the portfolio and revamped the leadership team. We also drove successful multiyear initiatives in payments and advertising, both of which exceeded ambitious targets. This unprecedented level of change in eBay all happened in parallel with a global pandemic that massively disrupted short-term consumer behavior. Their early results have demonstrated that our strategy is working, and the business is stronger than it was before the pandemic. Our focus categories are returning to market rates of growth. High-value buyers are growing, and they are spending more. We are empowering sellers by simplifying their experience, saving them money and providing tools to accelerate their growth.  Our technology investments are driving a simpler and more sustainable marketplace. And along the way, our investors have been rewarded with strong earnings growth and significant capital returns.  Looking ahead, we're excited about the next few years as we build on the momentum we have established. I look forward to introducing you to our world-class leadership team and sharing more about our plans, along with a few new initiatives we will unveil at Investor Day. We have our eyes squarely focused on deepening our relationship with sellers and buyers and building the world's most sustainable marketplace for the eBay community.  In closing, I would like to sincerely thank our extraordinary employees for an amazing year. They completed a huge payments transition, executed 2 large dispositions and improved the underlying growth of our business. While doing so, they delivered tremendous sustainability results and supported sellers and buyers during these challenging times.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. So Scott, this is Jamie. So on the U.S. versus international, as we talked about last quarter, there's a couple of dynamics that are impacting the differences in the growth rate. First, on the macro side, just different markets, GDP growth, inflation growth, retail growth are different and lower in Europe than what we're seeing in the U.S. We've talked about the supply chain challenges, which have a bigger impact on our international business than on our U.S. business. So in some cases in the U.S., we're favored by it in things like video graphics cards, which are in high demand.  At the same time, we have a strong cross-border trade business, and some of our sellers are impacted by some of the supply chain dynamics and export challenges. And that hits our international segment more than our U.S. segment.  The third component is really the focus categories are much more nascent in our international business than in the U.S. So think a category like watches, which has been live for several quarters in the U.S., we just rolled that out to U.K. and Germany this quarter, ditto with some of our other products and focus categories where they're still rolling it off to our international markets. And as we've seen, it takes a few quarters for us to achieve the growth rate levels that we saw in the U.S. But we believe that, that playbook will apply and that will help the convergence that you talked about.  The last thing is really just the collectible difference between the 2 markets. Trading cards and that whole segment is stronger in the U.S. than it is in international. So it's a long way to say that there's a number of factors that are at play there. But yes, we believe, over time, as the categories roll out, that will drive the convergence as well as some of the macro effects like the supply chain and other pieces change over time.  On your second question on M&A, yes, we continue to look at M&A as an opportunity to accelerate our tech-led reimagination. We've said we will be opportunistic to look at areas that are asset-light and consistent with our business to drive the strategy that we've laid out. The example I would point to is, most recently, Sneaker Con and that investment with authentication properties and services in 5 different countries enabling us to accelerate even faster what's happening on sneakers, where we've seen really great success. In fact, we think the playbook has worked well enough now that we're actually remonetizing sneakers this quarter for sneakers over $100. So it gives us scale, and it gives us flexibility, and that was the point of the acquisition. Yes. So thanks for the question. So we agree with you. So we think the benefit of having multiple advertising products is to appeal to not only multiple types of sellers but multiple types of advertising occasions. So we built our first $1 billion business over the last 5 years on a single product, which is a CPA-based product. And we've introduced 3 new products: Express, which is a fixed price, easy-to-understand product; external, which is really just an opt-in product for our external promoter listings, so that one is pretty straightforward: and then Advanced, which is actually a quite sophisticated product for SMBs, ones that are more used to keyword bidding, campaigns, daily budget levels, CPC amounts, et cetera.  And so what I would say is that we're happy because the CPA-based product, our product that's out there for 5 years, is actually a pretty easy product and a low-risk product, meaning, I only pay when I sell the product from that perspective. But we're also excited that the new products actually round out the portfolio of opportunities to drive advertisement.  The Advanced ones like CPC are still in a nascent stage. So we're still in a limited beta with those products. And it's really -- it'll take time just like it did for multi-years with the CPA to build the optimization, to drive trial, to drive adoption, et cetera. But exactly what you said is why we have the portfolio of products. And yes, we continue to look at ways to leverage artificial intelligence and other things to make not only the products easier for sellers to adopt, but also make them more effective in terms of the ROAS or the return on ad spend that we're seeing. Thus far, we've been really pleased with the ROAS that sellers are getting and shows us that there's continued opportunity in our advertising portfolio. Yes. So I'll start with the first one, and then, Steve, you can take the margin question. So on the focus category, yes, over time, we will be adding additional focus categories. Our next one is parts and accessories. And that category is a very large category on eBay, one where we come in from a position of strength. Especially in the U.K. and Germany, we have a market-leading position. There are some differences. Trading cards had a very strong year in '21. And so thus far, the category is performing well. But overall, I would say, yes, we think that the focus categories will continue to maintain a significant margin to the rest of the business.  And frankly, it's why we're excited and why we're investing, to your second question. If I just back up and take sneakers. Sneakers have been declining for 3 years, John, at double digits. We invested in the category. We've built critical specific marketing campaigns. We built an A+ experience that had over 90 customer satisfaction. And what you saw there is that the business really took off. We grew triple digits a year ago, still doing double digits in that business. And in fact, the category is still healthy now that we're actually remonetizing it. So we just reintroduced monetization over $100 for sneakers. And that's part of the investment that we're looking to do in '22 is to continue to roll out this winning formula that we have in the playbook to additional categories. Yes. So look, on high-value buyers, we've talked about the shift in strategy where back in 2019, we were focused on the total number of active buyers. And I've refocused the organization since last July on this idea of turning buyers into enthusiasts and really focusing on our high-value buyers. High-value buyers, if you look at it, are really made up of 2 groups, buyers who sell and then high-value buyers, buyers who buy over $800 and shop 6 times a year. When we look at high-value buyers in total this quarter, they're up 3% year on 2 year, whereas our low-value buyers are down 9% year on 2 year. So this is a very conscious strategy to not do low ASP couponing and some of the stuff that we were doing.  To your question, both of -- these metrics for buyers are trailing 12-metric -- 12-month metric. So what we're seeing is a slight deceleration from the infrequent sellers, and that's something that we had planned to see and will likely see for coming quarters in some time period. But the second group, the enthusiast buyers, is growing. And in fact, their spend is growing more each quarter so that it grew again this quarter. We call those our enthusiast buyers. I've met a lot of these enthusiast buyers, right? They wake up. They grab a cup of coffee, and they open up the eBay app. They shop eBay across multiple categories. And when you look at their spend, it's a very healthy spend level, right, $2,000-plus.  So what we're going to be focused on is things like driving the cross-category shopping nature of those buyers. And so take watches, for example, when we acquire a watch buyer, we'll get them to spend $9,000 in watches, but they'll go on to spend $7,000 in other categories. So we get this multiplier effect on eBay from being able to acquire somebody into a category and having them spend across the vast breadth that we offer.  So you'll see different patterns over time. We'll continue to see some deceleration from these infrequent sellers. And quarter-to-quarter, we may see some changes in high-value buyers. But overall, when we look at the trajectory of what we're doing is we're making the business a whole lot healthier by focusing on this group, getting to go cross-category and, frankly, acquiring enthusiasts right into our focus categories. That's the strategy that we'll have, and we'll go into more detail on Investor Day on March 10 on that. Yes. So as you've seen, Colin, I don't like to talk about where we're going next for competitive reasons and kind of giving away what is our next focus area. So the other one that we've announced is going after parts and accessories next as a large category dominant market leader position and a great opportunity for us. We talked about investment. You're starting to see full funnel marketing from what we're doing in parts and accessories from a leading position as well as a number of product changes like opening up our global category structure to make it easier to do cross-border trade business, putting all of our parts into the vehicles apps, et cetera. And so we'll go into a lot more depth on Investor Day at what we're seeing in the focus categories that we worked on and our path forward, but that's all that we've announced up until this point. Yes. A good example of that is in sneakers, right? So I talked about us remonetizing sneakers for sneakers over $100. We're still a great value for buyers and sellers versus other places that they can sell and buy sneakers. So we feel great about that. And that's the feedback that we've gotten from the community. We'll continue to make other smart changes like we did in parts and accessories, in watches and in certain categories constantly with this viewpoint of how do we provide the right value for our sellers on the platform to make sure we're bringing the best inventory on. Yes. So in general, we obviously studied the elasticity quite a bit. And what I was saying about sneakers is true, which is we're maintaining a double-digit growth in that category. And relative to other places that they can sell their sneakers, we're still very economical and the best value for doing so. So we always look at the elasticity, what's our opportunity to bring more demand. In certain cases, we do, for example, C2C promotions to bring sellers onto the platform in our various markets. But we're kind of rebalanced obviously being a great value for our sellers and our, ultimately, monetization.  I'd probably point you back, Ed, to what Steve said about advertising, which is the main vector for us in terms of driving monetization across the board and increasing the take rate. Other than that, we're really just looking at category by category and making sure that we're competitive. Yes, Tom. So on the videos, what I would say it's very, very early days. So we just rolled out the feature. Excited about it from 2 elements, though. One is excited for our eBay store sellers that they can now build a video to tell their story. One of the unique parts of eBay is it's not just a transactional model. So if you look at some of these models, your brand doesn't meet a whole lot. At eBay, we let the seller really build the brand and have access to 160 million buyers. And so that, I think, will be really powerful as more and more sellers adopt it.  The same thing is true for our listings and bringing video across the platform. One is it just makes the engagement of the platform much more compelling. I think about an oboe I recently bought them a platform of 2 quarters ago from my daughter. It was great, lots of pictures and lots of description, but god, a video and being able to hear it would have been even more compelling. You could think about that in a lot of categories.  So it's really early days. We're just adopting it for our API-based sellers and moving into our core listing flows. But we think over the coming quarters and years, it'll be an exciting new element for us on eBay. Yes. Great. So even really pioneered e-commerce, and I think the strategy we laid out last July of leaning into e-commerce, is leaning into right where the next generation is going. And I'm really happy because not only leading into where Gen Z is, but we're keeping products in circulation, keeping them out of the landfill.  We did a survey recently, and 87% of respondents said they had sold preowned goods in the last 12 months. And it's really important to Gen Z because it plays a huge role in their experience. 81% of Gen Z said that buying preowned items has become more common for them in the last year. So we feel great from a business perspective, but also from an ESG perspective.  If you think about what e-commerce does, we just made the Dow Jones Sustainability World in North America indices for the third year in a row. I talked about some of the other recognition that we had as an organization. We've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of emissions, just in apparel and preloved electronics. So from an ESG standpoint, we think ESG is so core to what eBay does, that we should be in every ESG fund. So both from a business and an ESG standpoint, we think we're leaning into a great vector of growth."

Then I will share some updates on the progress we're making towards our strategic vision.  At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Q3 was another strong quarter driven by our team's relentless focus on sellers and buyers. I'm excited by the positive impact this is having on the underlying health of the business.  The changes we are making to the marketplace are improving results today and are also putting us in a better position to deliver sustainable growth. We remain confident in our long-term vision to grow the core, become the seller platform of choice, and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter that brought us one step closer to this vision.  Our business delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings growth on the high end of our guidance. Our strategic playbook continues to improve customer satisfaction and build trust and is leading to faster GMV growth in our focus categories.  The managed payments migration, which is nearly complete, is helping sellers and buyers by reducing friction, lowering costs, and enabling new capabilities. Our advertising business continues to grow faster than marketplace volume, and our product innovation provides sellers new tools to help them scale their eBay businesses. We're also making great strides in our ESG effort.  Recently, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative for our multi-year carbon emission reduction goal. And importantly, we announced that eBay will be 100% carbon neutral this year, and will remain so going forward.  I'm pleased to report that all key business metrics either met or surpassed our expectations in Q3. Revenue over-performed growing 10%, driven by acceleration in the payments migration and promoted listings growth. We also delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS at the high-end of expectations while increasing technology investments. GMV performed in line with expectations globally, declining 12% versus last year and increasing 9% compared to 2019.  Excluding transitory macro impacts, we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in the business. Global active sellers remained unchanged at 19 million and total active buyers were 154 million.  Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating and focus categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We've also discontinued legacy couponing that skewed towards low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%.  Another ongoing transformation of our marketplace is managed payments, which progress quickly during the quarter. In Q3, we processed over 90% of on-platform GMV, and remain on track to finish by the end of this year.  I'm thrilled that we're close to migrating all of our global sellers to a next-gen product experience. While we are close to completing the transition, we are only at the beginning of realizing our full payments potential.  Owning the entire seller and buyer journey unlocks opportunities to remove friction, improve trust, and provide new capabilities to sellers and buyers. We are already starting down this path, and here are few examples. Last quarter, we effectively eliminated unpaid items on fixed-price transactions and have continued to reduce this issue for best offers. In the UK, we're paying many sellers as quickly as next business day after buyer payment is confirmed.  Based on community feedback, we've reduced another pain point for trusted sellers by increasing protection against fraudulent returns by requiring photos and providing returns shipping credits. In addition, we continue to improve our stores experience to make eBay the seller platform of choice.  We've been increasing our traffic to stores and providing more CRM capabilities to make managing their businesses on eBay easier than ever. Sellers are leveraging these new features to drive repeat purchases. For example, in only 6 months since launch, more than 2.5 million buyers have completed a repeat purchase from a store using our new seller funded coupons.  To further build sellers brands, we're testing video integration on high traffic pages to help them tell their unique and compelling stories to enthusiast buyers. Our advertising revenue continues to outpace volume due to promoted listings, which drove over $207 million in revenue in Q3 up 9%. We also tested 3 new promoted listings products and are starting to offer these features to more sellers.  In September, we opened up promoted listings, expressed more sellers in the U.S., UK, Germany and Australia. This feature allows sellers to boost visibility of auction listings for a one-time fee, regardless of whether the item is sold.  Early adopters have seen substantial growth in impressions and [Indiscernible]. Last month, we invited eligible sellers to try Promoted Listings Advanced, enabling them to create campaigns on a cost-per-click basis with more budget control. In parallel, we launched a suite of tools to create campaigns, monitor performance, and optimize returns. We're also providing training and webinars to drive trial and adoption.  During Q3, we explored ways to syndicate ads off eBay through external Promoted Listings. Through the eBay partner network, we're testing tools and incentives for affiliates to drive enthusiast buyers to existing Promoted Listings sellers. We are also experimenting with other forms of seller funded marketing across various channels.  Our new advertising products are in the early days, and we're excited about their long-term potential. Moving to our focus categories, I'm pleased with the pace of innovation and the positive reaction from our sellers and buyers. Volume from these categories continues to outperform the rest of the marketplace, and we are increasing customer satisfaction by improving trust.  As you may recall, when we exited last quarter, we had applied our playbook to approximately 10% of global GMV. We remain on track to expand that to roughly 20% by the end of the year. Let me walk you through several examples. Our sneakers business in the U.S. continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates.  During Q3, we launched authentication in Germany, added 30 more brands to our catalog, and improved SEO performance for top sneaker brands. We also lean further into upper funnel marketing and sponsored key industry events to strengthen our reputation with enthusiasts.  Starting tomorrow, we will be trialing a new 3D image capability on select sneaker listing. Leveraging AI and machine learning, the experience will allow buyers to interact with a detailed 360-degree view of the actual item they are buying. We're excited about the potential of this new technology, particularly the ability to reinforce buyer confidence at the point of purchase. Moving to luxury watches, this category is also growing at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. Buyers are finding more inventory on eBay than other marketplaces, as many brands have decreased production and pre -owned supply is limited on other platforms.  Since launching authentication and luxury handbags, growth has accelerated in this category and was positive in Q3, outperforming the total U.S. site by double-digits. We are seeing the same high customer satisfaction as other authenticated categories.  As I've mentioned in the past, part of our strategy is to drive enthusiasts to new trusted experiences, and then leverage those buyers across our vast supply in other categories. The average buyer who purchases sneakers and luxury watches spends approximately $2000 and $8000 respectively in other categories.  We are seeing the exact same behavior in our latest focus category. Buyers of authenticated handbags are spending over $5,000 outside of handbag. This cross-category benefit for sellers and buyers as a unique advantage for eBay.  One of the reasons our growth has improved in luxury categories is the improvement in buyer and seller trust. We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of authenticity guarantee, having now processed over 1.4 million items across multiple categories. Customer satisfaction has consistently exceeded 90%, and we are operating in 5 countries with a mix of in-house and third-party resources.  Another focus category that is driving growth in the U.S. is trading cards, which is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace. In late July, we launched new features, including price guides and collections, which allow trading card enthusiasts to view, manage, and track the value of their portfolios. To date, close to 4 million cards have been added to customer collections.  In addition, close to a quarter of a million buyers have used eBay's newly-launched price guide to visualize the changing value of their favorite trading cards. These features cater to the needs of high-value enthusiasts and are increasing engagement and trust in eBay. The next focus category we're applying the innovation playbook to is motors parts and accessories. [Indiscernible] creating a one-stop shop for vehicles and plus enthusiasts.  We're excited by the potential of bringing together one of the world's largest vehicle selections with hundreds of millions of parts in one customized experience. We're exploring further changes to parts and accessories that leverage our strong market position to capture more untapped growth.  ESG remains critical to our business health and to our customers, and I am pleased to announce that we have reached some significant milestones in our journey toward establishing eBay as the leading sustainability Company in e-commerce.  Just 2 weeks ago, we announced that our emission reduction goals were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We will reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90 [Indiscernible] this designation available and align. Additionally, we reduced value chain emissions from downstream transportation by 20% in the same timeframe.  To reduce emissions from goods shift using our platform, we will partner with our logistics providers to encourage low-carbon alternatives. I'm also proud that eBay will be carbon-neutral for our offices and data centers in 2021. We expect to maintain this going forward as we continue efforts to reduce our overall carbon footprint. At eBay, one of our core values is to be for everyone. As part of this focus, supporting our Seller Community is critically important.  Earlier this month, we issued a new report on equitable entrepreneurship, which revealed how selling on eBay helped women during the pandemic. We found that 82% of women who are new to eBay or increase their selling did so because of job loss, reduction of income, illness, loss of childcare, or some other hardship.  This vast majority of when women surveyed, says the ability to sell on eBay was a benefit during the pandemic, citing the need to earn additional income for themselves or drive revenue for their businesses.  I'm proud that our platform can provide flexibility and opportunity to so many during tough times so that they can earn extra income through selling on our marketplace. I'm also inspired by the continuous generosity of sellers and buyers on eBay.  During Q3, approximately $35 million was raised through eBay for charity, up 11%. Additionally, thousands of global employees help select small businesses to receive grants totaling $3 million from the eBay foundation.  These grants are focused on serving underrepresented entrepreneurs and are used to provide training, coaching, and mentorship needed to help their businesses thrive. In closing, as I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 was yet another strong quarter.  We continue to make progress on our multi-year journey, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Enthusiasts are responding to innovation in our focus categories and are increasingly putting their trust -- putting up new capabilities for sellers and buyers.  Our advertising business is innovating by providing a portfolio of tools our sellers can leverage to build and grow their businesses on eBay and setting and achieving ambitious climate goals and providing a platform where economic opportunity is available to all. I want to thank our passionate employees who have tirelessly work to bring our vision and purpose in life. Their dedication to serving sellers and buyers is inspiring.  Their relentless execution is driving innovation and making eBay a better marketplace, and I couldn't be prouder to be in this team. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie. And thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded the expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over-year comparisons reflect the extraordinary growth we experienced last year as a result of the pandemic.  These results were underpinned by continuous execution, divisions on payments, Promoted Listings, and focus categories. [Indiscernible] year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The transaction revenue grew by double-digits Primarily due to contributions from managed payments. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 per-share, and our operating margin is 31.7%.  We generated $502 million dollars of a free cash flow and returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during Q3. Given the underlying growth in our business and strong free cash flow generation, I'm pleased to announce we've raised our share buyback target for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion.  Our pending portfolio transactions remain on track to close within previously communicated timelines. We anticipate the sale of other [Indiscernible] shares. So [Indiscernible] were closed during Q4, while the career deal should close out the next year or potentially by the end of 2021.  Turning to active buyers on Slide five, we exit Q3 with a 154 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by low value buyers. [Indiscernible] makes more than half of our buyer base, but only 5% of GMV. As Jamie mentioned, this ongoing trend is a result of our strategy to prioritize attracting and retaining high body buyers.  We have confidence in this [Indiscernible] approach, but we recognize the reduction low value buyers could pressure our rolling 12-month active buyer accounts in the coming quarters. Compared with Q3 of 2019, low-value buyers are down 7%, while high-value buyers were up 6%.  Moving to GMV on Slide 6. In Q3, we delivered $19.5 billion of GMV, down 10% year-over-year on a spot basis, and down 12% on an FX-neutral basis in line with our expectations. The macro benefits to our business from mobility was significantly diminished in Q3 as restrictions sighted across the globe [Indiscernible] positive underlying growth in our business.  Compared with Q3 of 2019, GMV [Indiscernible] neutral basis. [Indiscernible] performance by market varied based on a number of factors, including relative mobility and [Indiscernible] specific macroeconomic trends. Internationally, GMV was roughly flat versus Q3 of 2019 on an FX-neutral basis.  A number of factors influenced the growth differential between the U.S. and our international markets during the quarter. My abilities back to pre-COVID levels in many of our largest international markets, diminishing the volume tailwinds we benefited from in third quarter. Changing consumer behavior, including uptake in leisure activities and travel, also might have impacted e-commerce guides internationally.  Additionally, category mix varies in our international markets, which have lower exposure to certain fast-growing verticals like collectibles. A higher concentration of items from cross-border trade that are more difficult to source amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Finally, our focus category rollouts on more nations in our international markets.  However, as our innovation playbook expands to more categories and countries, we are confident our international growth trajectory will increase. In the U.S., GMV grew 22% versus GMV of 2019. Growth in our domestic marketplace was driven by strong execution against our strategic pillars, big growth within e-commerce. Residential mobility improved in the U.S. and continues to trail Europe markets.  While leisure activities and travel increased in line with normalcy, including the lingering impact of government stimulus and [Indiscernible] The precise [Indiscernible] About likely a net positive contributor to U.S. growth in the near-term. And aggregate numerous puts and ties between regions, but we remain encouraged by the modestly positive underlying growth in our business.  Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Net revenue for Q3 was $2.5 billion of 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, also up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by managed payments, which contributed roughly 20 points of incremental revenue growth during the third quarter.  The payments ramp drives an 80 basis points sequentially increasing our take rate, which surpassed 12% increases to moderate as -- the managed payments rollout is nearly complete. Within the advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 9% year-over-year.  Our pricing volume by 20% of the new Promoted Listings products have seen significant increases in performance, giving us confidence in the long-term potential to advertising revenue. Marketing services and other revenue declined 7% year-over-year to a $151 million driven by the impact of sold item declines on shipping programs and headwinds within third-party advertising.  We continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising in favor of Promoted Listings, which delivered superior performance and offer a better experience for both sellers and buyers. Moving to expenses on Slide 8.  In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating [Indiscernible], primarily driven by lower volume. Our cost of revenue has scaled in line with payments growth due to variable processing costs. This dynamic has pressured gross margins during our transition to managed payments. However, once the transition is complete, we expect gross margins to be more stable.  Moreover, the incremental revenue from payments drive significant leverage in our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A. Sales and marketing fell by nearly 4 points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3. In addition to leverage from payments revenue, sales and marketing was lower due to reduction in coupons and rewards programs that were previously targeted towards low value buyers.  Product development increased 21% year-over-year, as we continue to accelerate product innovation, and support our longer-term strategic initiatives within payments, advertising on focus categories. Transaction losses rise as a percentage of revenue by nearly 2 points versus last year due to higher consumer protection losses from the payments transition.  And the lapping of onetime benefits in the prior year, which were partially offset by the benefits of fee netting. Turning to EPS on Slide 9. We delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3 at 9% year-over-year, as ramping contributions from payments on the net benefit share repurchases, more than offset the lapping of COVID -driven volumes, a year-ago.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, the dealt was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment on other venture shares, partly offset by gains from other investments. Switching to free cash flow on Slide 10, we delivered another strong quarter of cash generation in Q3 with $502 million of free cash flow, a 4% decline year-over-year.  The decline was driven by the timing of working capital and capex spend, partly offset by operational efficiencies and the timing of 2020 cash taxes. As a reminder, the managed payments transition has yield meaningful working capital benefits. Through three quarters of 2021, this benefit amounted to approximately $300 million.  Moving to capital allocation on Slide 11. we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.1 billion. In gross -- quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to our shareholders through stock repricing dividends. We repurchased approximately 31 million shares for $2.3 billion with an average share price of $72.52. We also paid a quarterly dividend of a $116 million in September.  Given our fortress balance sheet and strong underlying free cash flow, we are updating our share buyback plan for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion, which implies approximately $3 billion of repurchases during the fourth quarter. Over all, our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged. We'll preserve financial flexibility to execute on strategy and drive long-term value creation.  We aim to drive organic growth in our business, and will look for opportunities to supplement that growth, with disciplined acquisitions and investments. We will optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt, and cost of capital, and we'll continue to deliver meaningful returns to shareholders -- to share repurchases and dividends.  We made 2 investments on Slide 12. As a reminder, we received 540 million shares in Adevinta from a classified sale, which closed during June of this year, represents an equity ownership stake of approximately 44%. As a regulatory condition of the classified sale, we committed to reduce our ownerships like in Adevinta just to 33% or less over 18 months following the close of the deal.  In July, we agreed to sell approximately 135 million shares to Permira for roughly $2.4 billion. We believe that Permira share trial remains on track to close during Q4 from the 405 million shares that we would retain, were worth close to $7 billion at the end of September.  Turning to Adyen, the ones we acquired in connection with our strategic partnership during the second quarter of 2018, were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. You will find more information on the Adyen [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] Our staking to [Indiscernible] banks as appreciates the embody following the Company's IPR in August. At the end of Q3, our investment was worth approximately $800 million. Finally, in June, we announced plans to sell the 80% of our carrier business to A-Mark's for approximately $3 billion, higher than implied value of roughly $800 million at the time of the announcement.  We believe the deal remains on track supplies by early 2022 with a possibility of closing before the year-end. We remain excited about [Indiscernible] employable investments. The potential optionality that provide a significant value that collectively represent the eBay shareholders. Turning to guidance on Slide 13.  For the fourth quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 and $2.62 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% on an FX-neutral basis, and approximately 4% to 6% on a spot basis. Our pay rates have risen notably in recent quarters due to contributions and payments in advertising.  Although we expect advertising to continue growing faster than volume, we expect the impact from payments on our tight rates and moderate as we're nearing completion of our managed payments transition. We are raising our 2021 full-year outlook for payments revenue for 1.8 [Indiscernible].  Revenue guidance implies GMV is down low teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year. And at mid to high single-digits compared to Q4 of 2019 focus categories. Our outlook also assumes minimal benefits from macro factors like mobility stimulus and supply chain impacts. However, we know the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict with varied impacts from country to country.  We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 to $1.01 per share in Q4, represents the 14% to 19% year-over-year. We're investing in positive technology to deliver better tax [Indiscernible] appearances and improve customer satisfaction. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to between 18% and 19% due to recent outperformance of our U.S. business. We expect our GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share in Q4.  In closing, we delivered strong results in Q3, the maximum exceeded expectations across all key metrics. We continue to execute our strategic vision and grow our core marketplace while maintaining the balance and discipline that will enable us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders for years to come.  Managed payments are on track to deliver $2 billion in revenue this year. And that transition is on track for completion by year-end. However, we believe our tightness journey is just beginning. This milestone unlocks new opportunities to reduce friction in the marketplace and provide additional financial services.  Advertising revenue continues to outpace volume, sell as increasingly leverage our expanded product portfolio to amplify the exposure of [Indiscernible] We observed impressive momentum with our focus categories, which are meaningfully out pricing overall volume [Indiscernible] We're confident we can continue expanding this innovation playbook to more categories and countries in the quarters ahead. Our balance approach to capital allocation has enabled us to reinvest in our business, generate consistently strong free cash flow, and deliver attractive returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  As proud as I am about numerous business accomplishments, what makes them even more impactful to me, is knowing we're achieving these milestones while building sustainable, inclusive, and secular economy platform for all.  Once again, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their incredible work as the last quarter and the support for our amazing sellers and buyers in the eBay community. One final note, we are in the midst of a multiyear journey to deliver tech led re-imagination of eBay.  As the impact from macro factors stabilizes, we are reviewing our internal goals for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate showing our longer-term goals and aspirations in investor event early next year. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator, over to you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We have our first question coming from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Really wanted to quick down a little bit on some of the categories that you're re-imagining and some of the success you're noting there. Just help us understand maybe the new customers you're growing into the platform.  I know you've identified from dollar amounts, but just to clarify, are those new customers or is that customers that are participating in those categories? And then as a follow-up, what are the marketing plans to encourage new customer growth in these categories that you've re-imagined? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. I'll take that. First on the categories, it really is about both leading into the high-value buyers that are on the platform, as well as attracting new buyers in. If you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or -- this quarter we announced what is the cross-category nature of shopping.  So, if we acquire a buyer into a handbag, who buys a handbag over $500, they actually end up spending $5,000 dollars in other categories outside of handbags on the site. So, when we think about acquisition, it's not just acquiring it for that category, it's acquiring it more broadly for eBay. That's one of our significant benefits.  Excited because we've expanded categories this quarter, we brought our sneakers authentication program to Germany. We brought watches to the UK business, and we launched handbags in the U.S. in terms of that product.  From a certified refurbished, we added new brands, [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] and expanded number of products there, and that's exciting coming into holiday. On your question on marketing, we've really shifted our marketing.  I think traditionally we've been a mostly lower funnel with some broad-based campaigns on upper funnel, really driving into how do we inquire high -- acquire high-value buyers and high-value enthusiast in specific verticals.  So, what that means is a whole lot more of upper funnel marketing partnerships, leaning in with social media influencers in certain categories, and basically going much broader with our marketing plans to find those buyers where they are. And I guess the last thing I'd say is we're really focused on the first 90-day experience on eBay.  Many times, in my career, I've done this where you really get focused on how do you introduce them to the brand, bring them up to life cycle, make sure that they turn into the high-value buyers that we want to do. And that's going to be a continued focus for us over the coming quarters.\nEdward Yruma: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We have our next question [Indiscernible].\nColin Sebastian: On the core marketplace improvements. You obviously focused a lot on category specific changes and that's working well. How much effort is there in platform wide enhancements? And if there are any sort of specific initiatives there, what will be the timing for those? And then, Steve, maybe with respect to the Q4 outlook, just looking at the sequential ramp versus typical seasonality, it's certainly a little light of historical patterns.  Even eBay could be a net beneficiary from supply chain issues, I know, like factoring that into the outlook, but maybe some additional color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks for the question, Colin. So, we do talk a lot about the vertical expansion and focus category work that we're doing and we're excited for what's happening there. If you actually step back and look at it, the vast majority of our resources are actually going to site-wide initiatives across the board.  And I'd point to a couple of, one is obviously our ad business, and a lot of investment there across-the-board, especially with the 3 new products that we're at the beginning of launching. Obviously, payments, huge initiative. But other areas that we haven't talked a lot about, like eBay stores.  So, working on a next-gen experience in eBay stores, incorporating videos, so allowing sellers to tell their story from that perspective. But a more CRM tool capability so that sellers can be more involved in how we bring buyers back to the platform and drive that repeat business.  So, the stat I just mentioned earlier about, we launched it 6 months ago, but now sellers are funding the coupons to drive buyers back to the site from past buyers or interested buyers. And that's a huge benefit for sellers and a huge benefit for eBay because we're involving them and driving them, and already 2.5 million buyers have used that in that time period.  And so, we're also testing a new selling experience. You -- if you're on the site, you'll see that there's a beta out there of a new way to sell. So most of the -- the vast majority investments are going to horizontal. But what I like is it's a compliment.  Because some of those horizontal lean into some of the vertical work that we're doing in the vertical work and focus categories. Some of the things that we're building for a given category, we're able to use in a number of categories across the site. The 2 also play together well. Steve I'll let you take the second part of the question.\nSteve Priest: Yeah thank you Jamie. Hi, Colin. Continue to lie out. We will not only move the focus categories but also the momentum alliance. So, payments and ounces have gone forward. On a year over 2 bases, if you think about on a standby year-over-year we're obviously lapping a pandemic. On a year over 2 bases, we're seeing mid-to-high single-digit growth compared to Q4, 2019. I think as a [Indiscernible]  First of all, a holiday perspective around Q4 is embedded in the guide. From a headwind perspective, in the prepared comments we had, we talked about supply chain pressure for cross-border trade that we see on one side, but in terms of a tailwind, obviously, eBay is well known for unique and scarce items, which we do expect some support to the holiday periods.  So, a few puts and takes, but overall, I'm pleased with the label be continued modestly positive to underlying growth on the platform as a result of the initiatives that we're driving forward.\nColin Sebastian: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Q - Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great, thanks for taking the question just 2 quick ones. First, can you elaborate on the new Promoted Listings offerings? I mean, should we expect these offerings to drive adoption among a broader range of sellers? And maybe related to that, can you provide an update on why you [Indiscernible] question, I realize this might be a little bit [Indiscernible] for next year.  [Indiscernible] feels like you have plenty of capacity [Indiscernible] you're thinking about to do it in a more programmatic way after the 7 billion this year. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. On the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just explain the 3 in details. The first one which is Express, is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions. Since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really only applied to fixed price. And so, this opens up your wallet smaller format at the site of format that has not been open to advertising before.  Promoted Listings Express is a C2C -based product. Gives sellers the opportunity to drive more velocity, goes after a different type of marketing budget for that perspective and given us the opportunity to work with a secondary and supplementary advertising format.  And the third is off eBay advertising, and that's using the vast marketing reach that eBay does today, partnering with our sellers to drive advertising as part of that off eBay outreach to bring existing buyers and new buyers back to the platform.  I will say for you is that it's early days on these 3 products. If you look back, we started our ad business 5 years ago and we've grown to a billion dollars now over 5 years. So, we're at the point now where we're testing, we're learning.  We've got invited sellers into the program. And just like it took us time to build up the CPA based program, I think it will take us time here to build up the advertising program. In terms of penetration, we still have a lot of opportunity left, both in terms of the sellers and Listings.  I believe the last that we shared was that only 400 million of the Listings have advertising associated with them. So, there's a lot of opportunity for additional penetration. I'll let Steve take the second question about how we're thinking about the future.\nSteve Priest: I'll take that. I'm not going at that myself for 2022. We haven't what the guidance out there, but I'll give us a little bit of color in terms of where we are. As we've previously said, reinvestments in the business is our first priority, whether that's Farrell Boto partner, but having said that, beyond that any excess cash that we do have continues to drive returns.  We'll continue with a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. And this is not any different in the past. We had a strong and consistent history. I've actually noticed some capital returns, and in 2021 must be no exception. So, think about us going from 2 billion at the start of the year, lifting up to 5 billion, and most recently on this call, we're talking about $7 billion.  I think when I stand back and think about eBay as a whole, the balance that we have and the benefits for the franchise, is we often have the ability to do both, in terms of reinvesting the business and the and capital we bought.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. 2 questions. One on just U.S. versus international. So, it seems like a big reason why your U.S. GMV is way above 3Q '19, I think you said it was about 23 or something like that, compared to international is a little bit on the IST comp, but also from these focus category initiatives. So, what's holding back the same type of uptick for international? Is it structural or is it just a timing thing, and we should see a ramp up after you roll those out after starting in the U.S.  And then the second question is on how will eBay Motors these days are not a big category historically, and just can you talk about a little bit about the opportunity there in terms of making that one focus category emerging departs with the motors?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Let me start with U.S. versus international. First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-two-year basis, based on the strategic vision we impacted by mobility returning to really pre-COVID levels, coupled with an unprecedented in snapback in travel and leisure activities in Europe. In addition, as Steve mentioned a little bit earlier, our international cross-port trade.  Trade sellers were also pressured by supply chain disruptions that tends to be more in our international segment from across border perspective than in our U.S. segment. On the other hand, in the U.S., we've seen strong growth driven by momentum in our core business. To your question on the focus categories, it's not a structural change. We actually think the work we're doing applies across the whole globe, it's really a timing thing.  In most of these areas, we actually roll them out in the U.S., get them perfected here and then expand them internationally. For example, Sneakers is just now launching this quarter in Germany, we launched watches in the U.S. We just started that expansion in the UK this quarter, handbags we just launched in the U.S. and that hasn't expanded yet.  So, it's really a timing thing, but we think the playbook that we have is relevant in every single market that we have. Probably with the exception of trading cards and collectibles. That's just so much stronger in the U.S. than it is internationally, but that's a huge U.S. benefit and a lot of the pieces that we're doing there are our key focus for that.  But overall, feel great about the health of the business and our ability to expand those focus categories internationally. On your second question on P&A, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, but I will say that if you just step back and look at the market, we're in a leading position in P&A, especially in UK and in Germany.  It's a very strong category and a very strong franchise there. It's the key part of our path that we talked about last quarter, of going from 10% of the site to 20% of the site. It's a strong category for eBay because of the vastness of parts and accessories that we have.  We actually do a fairly good job with fitment. I talked last quarter about my garage feature and how we've expanded that internationally, which helps with fitment. We also recently announced a motorcycle parts finder in that business.  And it tends to help and be benefit also from a cross-border trade. To give you a sense of scale, we've got hundreds of millions of listings in our parts business. And what I'm excited by is one of the first evolutions that we did was take all of that inventory and make it available on our motor\u2019s app, which is a dedicated separate app for vehicle enthusiasts.  And now you've got vehicles and parts and accessories in a One Stop Shop from that perspective. So, you'll continue to hear further updates from us about that category. It's our next big category focus and one where we're coming into it from a position of strength.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. To on payments, you've removed a lot of the friction already. Now that you have 90 plus percent of sellers can migrate on to managed payments. Just what's next in terms of improving the experience going forward? And then just curious if you have any preliminary thoughts on some of the managed payments numbers in '22 in terms of revenue and operating income. Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. First on the friction, the whole idea of bringing commerce and payments together gives us great opportunities to remove friction. So, on the selling side, people now only have to set up for single account and get selling.  All of their claims are managed in one place. Tons of benefits from there. One of the ones that I'm really excited by is that since I worked at eBay, the last time starting in 2001, unpaid items have been on this platform forever.  And so now, we've eliminated it and fixed-price virtually. We're doing so in best offer. And so, sellers won't have to face that issue, and it takes friction out of the platform. On the buy-side, it allows us to open up new opportunities for different forms of payments.  Clearly, we've already integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, but we launched the partnership with After pay in our Australia business for buy now, pay later. After pay is a very strong brand in that market. And that's bringing us new customers. It's already at 10% of our business there. And we're continuing to look at new opportunities for forms of payment for our buyers.  Secondarily is on the seller financing -- payments through the business. So, like I said in the call, the way I look at it, the migration is complete, but we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity of what we can do with commerce and payments together in a single flow -- in a single experience.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Doug. With regards to your question on payments rollout 2022, too early to talk about 2022. We're not taking drive that at this point, but I did want to read, that's why I had delighted we are with the progress we've made with over 90% of the platform volume, with over 18 million sellers joint to the platform now.  We laid out some goals, joining back a couple of years with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue and $500 million of ROI. We're well on track. Margin is in line. So, we're very, very happy with where we are.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you both.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, sir.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Because a couple of quick questions. Any impact on auction bid density from the loss of low-quality buyers? Or any impacts that we have on the marketplace beyond that just percentage of GMV? And then you recently, during the summer, started showing buyers all shipping services offered by sellers, allows them to select carriers and shipping costs, and estimated deliveries. It's still early days, but can you talk about what impact that's having, if any, on conversion rates?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. On the first question, on auction by density, no, we're not seeing an impact from that. Frankly, that format has actually been really strong because of the strength we're seeing collectibles where it tends to be a more used format.  And I'm excited that we are starting to launch Express because that will give our auction sellers the ability to drive some more visibility for them and then to have a tool that they haven't been able to use before. In terms of the shipping services, this has been a constant march for us.  Last year, we expanded in the U.S. to have USPS, UPS and FedEx in there and did the same thing with Royal Mail and Australia Post to greatly exceed the amount of tracking. On the specific shipping test that's going on, now, it's kind of too early to tell. What I would say in general is how to think about this, Brian, is I'm trying to get the whole Company focused on how do we make things as simple and as easy to do on the platform.  So, what we're doing with our new seller flows, with computer vision and trading cards is how do we take all of the work out of the listing process. We're trying to do the same type of thing with our sellers and the stores product and making it really easy to get that setup on the platform. Shipping is one of those areas where there's an opportunity to take a lot of the friction out.  The new partnerships that we've created, the integrated tracking, the smoother returns process is all part of this evolution of just make the whole platform so much easier to use. And so, we'll keep you posted on how these tests roll out, but I'm happy with the progress so far.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, Jamie. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion : Good afternoon. And thanks very much. Jamie, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit of about [Indiscernible] hopefully, I'm pronouncing it right. It looks like you made an investment, but seems like kind of a B2B or commercial products.  How does this fit strategically? And then I noticed the C2C GMV was down 13%. I think that was a little below GMV overall, this usually outperforms and just curious what might have driven the result there.  And Steve maybe just a quick one for you. Buybacks to 7 billion, looks like 3 billion in repurchases this quarter, increase from 5 billion in repurchases last quarter. I'm just curious if the increase in the buyback reflects greater confidence in the fundamentals. Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. On the first one, look, I've been talking since last July about the game changing level of trust on the platform. And we've been doing that kind of category by category. So, the authentication that we've been doing in the luxury categories really takes trust off the table.  These 2-year warranties that we put in place for certified refurbished does the same thing. And eBay actually has a good size business and industrial business in capital equipment, and [Indiscernible] allows us to put a whole different level of trust in there.  They're a long-time seller in partner on eBay and the capabilities that they will bring to that category will help bring a new level of trust and just help buyers and sellers in that category move forward. So that's what I would say I'm going to do. On the C2C, it's really just a lapping of the COVID dynamics that we saw from last year, in terms of time period and just some of the macro dynamics.  What I'd tell you is I'm really happy with the progress and continue to be a huge focus for us is on our C2C selling experience, bringing them onto the platform making it as extremely easy, making that payment sign-up process really, really simple.  And so that's going to continue to be something that we're going to focus on quarter-after-quarter because as I mentioned in the past, we -- when we talk about high-value buyers, that includes buyers themselves.  By nature, it helps drive them up their buyer cohort curves as well as bringing that unique inventory. So, we're going to continue to push forward there. And then Steve, do you want to take the last one?\nSteve Priest: Yeah, thanks Jamie. Tom, I think it's been interesting thing the coming about 4 months now and I think the one thing I would say is just what's rated strengthening the durability of the financial model, with best-in-class margins, really significant value with the ongoing platform and that [Indiscernible] Balance Sheet.  If you take that and you pair it with the structure that Jamie is laid out, and the momentum that we're going forward with, I think anybody franchise translates pretty misunderstood. One of the things that we need to do about a job is just really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better Again, your points is well made.  The momentum is shown on the buyback and capital allocation as we progress through 2021, from the 2 billion to the 5 billion and at the 7 billion is really a source of reflection of that in terms of our thought process around balanced and disciplined capital allocation, and getting that balance right between reinvestment in the business, just the right growth, and providing the very best returns to our shareholders.\nTom Champion : Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. So, Jamie, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about what sounded like a 3D modeling technology. You're using in the sneaker\u2019s category. So how easy or difficult is this to do and presumably, and hopefully, this is driving higher conversion rates were this is rolled out as you're presenting more information to the buyers, Apache might be rolled out to. And I guess as a follow-up to the earlier C2C question, as you get more and more buyers to become sellers over time, are you seeing pretty consistent behavior with the newest batch of converted users versus the earlier cohorts. Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. On your first question, it's a very early test in pilot that we're doing. But the idea is we want buyers to be able to see in real detail, the actual item that they're going to be buying. So, you're going to see us launching a couple of sneakers in the coming weeks using this. It's a very early pilot that we're doing with Select Sellers.  But it's all about building trust on the platform. I bought a $4 thousand OBO on the platform last year and it was great. I can see a lot of images, but the opportunity to really get in there in 3D and then see what a [Indiscernible] product looks like is an interesting opportunity. So, like I said, it's very real, you will start to see some products that we had.  I'm using that technology, but I'm -- what I'm excited by is, like the innovation in computer vision, we're using our AI resources and computer vision resources here to do some interesting things that over time, I think will really change the buying experience on eBay. To your question on C2C, it looks pretty consistent in terms of them coming on to the platform continuing to list, and then turning into buyers. You know what I'd say is -- the other thing is that a lot of our business sellers actually started out as C2C sellers.  So, it's another reason we lean in there. I was visiting with a seller years ago. He had an extra set of tires, sold them on eBay, and then just started selling a couple of more things in tires and [Indiscernible] that's helped a lot of our B2C sellers actually get their start on the platform.\nJoe Billante: Operator, I think we've got time for one more.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Solomon: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for slipping me in. First Jamie, can you just expand a little bit on the affiliate program that you cited is one of the 3 new initiatives for Promoted Listings the opportunity to take it off platform, what are you hoping -- what probably hoping to sell for your sellers with that? And if you could add some color on how significant you think that opportunity could be relative to the 1 billion run rate that you're approaching for the onsite Promoted Listings business.  And then just second [Indiscernible], will you go to exit [Indiscernible] you expect the metric to remain under pressure? And the strategy certainly seem sound, but is your goal here to ultimately exit all of those low value buyers? I'm just hoping you can add some context to the scope of the strategy. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. On the first one, the off eBay advertising product, let me separate that from the affiliate advertising we do [Indiscernible] -- form and be an affiliate. But the 2 definitely work hand-in-hand together. The whole vision there is really connecting enthusiasts to sellers.  So being out on the platforms where those enthusiasts star and letting our sellers partake in that advertising type thing by putting really interesting items in front of those enthusiasts of driving that marketing, because eBay has been doing this marketing. And when we do it in cooperation with our sellers it gives us a really broad reach.  For sellers It gives them another tool as well, to take all the great inventory that they have on eBay and put it out in front of sellers. And various communities, to really drive that traffic to their business on eBay. I'll let Steve take the second one and maybe I'll maybe I'll add on a bit\nSteve Priest: Hi Dough (ph.), you know, it's not -- it's not about -- I think it's about focus. And I think we're constantly thinking about acquisition of buyers and growth on the platform. And really, it is about really changing our strategy and our focus.  And I just want to reiterate about the value of various buyers bring. So, if I think about our top 20 high-value buyers, or 20% of our buyers, and deliver 75% of our GMV. Nice buyers are making 6 different purchases 6 different times a year and over $800 and net buyers itself.  But the low value buyers, it's about 50% of our -- on that strategy as we continue to evolve the platform, focus on the enthusiasts, focus on cost category selling. But it's very, very important that we continue to have a pipeline as we evolve the business in growth going forward.\nJamie Iannone: Actually, it ties in well with your first question, Dan, about the off eBay advertising product is, how do we make sure we're in those places where actually going to apply those high-value enthusiasts.  And putting our -- but much more focus on how we turning buyers in the high-value enthusiasts, and how we're altering our marketing plans so that were out there actually acquiring them onto the platform, because that's what drives the real health of the businesses, is the growth of those high-value buyers and how we're doing in connecting those enthusiasts. So good question because the 2 really tie together.\nDan Solomon: Great. Great. That was very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A session for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. And thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded the expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over-year comparisons reflect the extraordinary growth we experienced last year as a result of the pandemic.  These results were underpinned by continuous execution, divisions on payments, Promoted Listings, and focus categories. [Indiscernible] year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The transaction revenue grew by double-digits Primarily due to contributions from managed payments. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 per-share, and our operating margin is 31.7%.  We generated $502 million dollars of a free cash flow and returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during Q3. Given the underlying growth in our business and strong free cash flow generation, I'm pleased to announce we've raised our share buyback target for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion.  Our pending portfolio transactions remain on track to close within previously communicated timelines. We anticipate the sale of other [Indiscernible] shares. So [Indiscernible] were closed during Q4, while the career deal should close out the next year or potentially by the end of 2021.  Turning to active buyers on Slide five, we exit Q3 with a 154 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by low value buyers. [Indiscernible] makes more than half of our buyer base, but only 5% of GMV. As Jamie mentioned, this ongoing trend is a result of our strategy to prioritize attracting and retaining high body buyers.  We have confidence in this [Indiscernible] approach, but we recognize the reduction low value buyers could pressure our rolling 12-month active buyer accounts in the coming quarters. Compared with Q3 of 2019, low-value buyers are down 7%, while high-value buyers were up 6%.  Moving to GMV on Slide 6. In Q3, we delivered $19.5 billion of GMV, down 10% year-over-year on a spot basis, and down 12% on an FX-neutral basis in line with our expectations. The macro benefits to our business from mobility was significantly diminished in Q3 as restrictions sighted across the globe [Indiscernible] positive underlying growth in our business.  Compared with Q3 of 2019, GMV [Indiscernible] neutral basis. [Indiscernible] performance by market varied based on a number of factors, including relative mobility and [Indiscernible] specific macroeconomic trends. Internationally, GMV was roughly flat versus Q3 of 2019 on an FX-neutral basis.  A number of factors influenced the growth differential between the U.S. and our international markets during the quarter. My abilities back to pre-COVID levels in many of our largest international markets, diminishing the volume tailwinds we benefited from in third quarter. Changing consumer behavior, including uptake in leisure activities and travel, also might have impacted e-commerce guides internationally.  Additionally, category mix varies in our international markets, which have lower exposure to certain fast-growing verticals like collectibles. A higher concentration of items from cross-border trade that are more difficult to source amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Finally, our focus category rollouts on more nations in our international markets.  However, as our innovation playbook expands to more categories and countries, we are confident our international growth trajectory will increase. In the U.S., GMV grew 22% versus GMV of 2019. Growth in our domestic marketplace was driven by strong execution against our strategic pillars, big growth within e-commerce. Residential mobility improved in the U.S. and continues to trail Europe markets.  While leisure activities and travel increased in line with normalcy, including the lingering impact of government stimulus and [Indiscernible] The precise [Indiscernible] About likely a net positive contributor to U.S. growth in the near-term. And aggregate numerous puts and ties between regions, but we remain encouraged by the modestly positive underlying growth in our business.  Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Net revenue for Q3 was $2.5 billion of 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, also up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by managed payments, which contributed roughly 20 points of incremental revenue growth during the third quarter.  The payments ramp drives an 80 basis points sequentially increasing our take rate, which surpassed 12% increases to moderate as -- the managed payments rollout is nearly complete. Within the advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 9% year-over-year.  Our pricing volume by 20% of the new Promoted Listings products have seen significant increases in performance, giving us confidence in the long-term potential to advertising revenue. Marketing services and other revenue declined 7% year-over-year to a $151 million driven by the impact of sold item declines on shipping programs and headwinds within third-party advertising.  We continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising in favor of Promoted Listings, which delivered superior performance and offer a better experience for both sellers and buyers. Moving to expenses on Slide 8.  In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating [Indiscernible], primarily driven by lower volume. Our cost of revenue has scaled in line with payments growth due to variable processing costs. This dynamic has pressured gross margins during our transition to managed payments. However, once the transition is complete, we expect gross margins to be more stable.  Moreover, the incremental revenue from payments drive significant leverage in our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A. Sales and marketing fell by nearly 4 points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3. In addition to leverage from payments revenue, sales and marketing was lower due to reduction in coupons and rewards programs that were previously targeted towards low value buyers.  Product development increased 21% year-over-year, as we continue to accelerate product innovation, and support our longer-term strategic initiatives within payments, advertising on focus categories. Transaction losses rise as a percentage of revenue by nearly 2 points versus last year due to higher consumer protection losses from the payments transition.  And the lapping of onetime benefits in the prior year, which were partially offset by the benefits of fee netting. Turning to EPS on Slide 9. We delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3 at 9% year-over-year, as ramping contributions from payments on the net benefit share repurchases, more than offset the lapping of COVID -driven volumes, a year-ago.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, the dealt was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment on other venture shares, partly offset by gains from other investments. Switching to free cash flow on Slide 10, we delivered another strong quarter of cash generation in Q3 with $502 million of free cash flow, a 4% decline year-over-year.  The decline was driven by the timing of working capital and capex spend, partly offset by operational efficiencies and the timing of 2020 cash taxes. As a reminder, the managed payments transition has yield meaningful working capital benefits. Through three quarters of 2021, this benefit amounted to approximately $300 million.  Moving to capital allocation on Slide 11. we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.1 billion. In gross -- quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to our shareholders through stock repricing dividends. We repurchased approximately 31 million shares for $2.3 billion with an average share price of $72.52. We also paid a quarterly dividend of a $116 million in September.  Given our fortress balance sheet and strong underlying free cash flow, we are updating our share buyback plan for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion, which implies approximately $3 billion of repurchases during the fourth quarter. Over all, our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged. We'll preserve financial flexibility to execute on strategy and drive long-term value creation.  We aim to drive organic growth in our business, and will look for opportunities to supplement that growth, with disciplined acquisitions and investments. We will optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt, and cost of capital, and we'll continue to deliver meaningful returns to shareholders -- to share repurchases and dividends.  We made 2 investments on Slide 12. As a reminder, we received 540 million shares in Adevinta from a classified sale, which closed during June of this year, represents an equity ownership stake of approximately 44%. As a regulatory condition of the classified sale, we committed to reduce our ownerships like in Adevinta just to 33% or less over 18 months following the close of the deal.  In July, we agreed to sell approximately 135 million shares to Permira for roughly $2.4 billion. We believe that Permira share trial remains on track to close during Q4 from the 405 million shares that we would retain, were worth close to $7 billion at the end of September.  Turning to Adyen, the ones we acquired in connection with our strategic partnership during the second quarter of 2018, were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. You will find more information on the Adyen [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] Our staking to [Indiscernible] banks as appreciates the embody following the Company's IPR in August. At the end of Q3, our investment was worth approximately $800 million. Finally, in June, we announced plans to sell the 80% of our carrier business to A-Mark's for approximately $3 billion, higher than implied value of roughly $800 million at the time of the announcement.  We believe the deal remains on track supplies by early 2022 with a possibility of closing before the year-end. We remain excited about [Indiscernible] employable investments. The potential optionality that provide a significant value that collectively represent the eBay shareholders. Turning to guidance on Slide 13.  For the fourth quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 and $2.62 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% on an FX-neutral basis, and approximately 4% to 6% on a spot basis. Our pay rates have risen notably in recent quarters due to contributions and payments in advertising.  Although we expect advertising to continue growing faster than volume, we expect the impact from payments on our tight rates and moderate as we're nearing completion of our managed payments transition. We are raising our 2021 full-year outlook for payments revenue for 1.8 [Indiscernible].  Revenue guidance implies GMV is down low teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year. And at mid to high single-digits compared to Q4 of 2019 focus categories. Our outlook also assumes minimal benefits from macro factors like mobility stimulus and supply chain impacts. However, we know the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict with varied impacts from country to country.  We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 to $1.01 per share in Q4, represents the 14% to 19% year-over-year. We're investing in positive technology to deliver better tax [Indiscernible] appearances and improve customer satisfaction. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to between 18% and 19% due to recent outperformance of our U.S. business. We expect our GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share in Q4.  In closing, we delivered strong results in Q3, the maximum exceeded expectations across all key metrics. We continue to execute our strategic vision and grow our core marketplace while maintaining the balance and discipline that will enable us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders for years to come.  Managed payments are on track to deliver $2 billion in revenue this year. And that transition is on track for completion by year-end. However, we believe our tightness journey is just beginning. This milestone unlocks new opportunities to reduce friction in the marketplace and provide additional financial services.  Advertising revenue continues to outpace volume, sell as increasingly leverage our expanded product portfolio to amplify the exposure of [Indiscernible] We observed impressive momentum with our focus categories, which are meaningfully out pricing overall volume [Indiscernible] We're confident we can continue expanding this innovation playbook to more categories and countries in the quarters ahead. Our balance approach to capital allocation has enabled us to reinvest in our business, generate consistently strong free cash flow, and deliver attractive returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  As proud as I am about numerous business accomplishments, what makes them even more impactful to me, is knowing we're achieving these milestones while building sustainable, inclusive, and secular economy platform for all.  Once again, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their incredible work as the last quarter and the support for our amazing sellers and buyers in the eBay community. One final note, we are in the midst of a multiyear journey to deliver tech led re-imagination of eBay.  As the impact from macro factors stabilizes, we are reviewing our internal goals for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate showing our longer-term goals and aspirations in investor event early next year. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator, over to you. Yeah thank you Jamie. Hi, Colin. Continue to lie out. We will not only move the focus categories but also the momentum alliance. So, payments and ounces have gone forward. On a year over 2 bases, if you think about on a standby year-over-year we're obviously lapping a pandemic. On a year over 2 bases, we're seeing mid-to-high single-digit growth compared to Q4, 2019. I think as a [Indiscernible]  First of all, a holiday perspective around Q4 is embedded in the guide. From a headwind perspective, in the prepared comments we had, we talked about supply chain pressure for cross-border trade that we see on one side, but in terms of a tailwind, obviously, eBay is well known for unique and scarce items, which we do expect some support to the holiday periods.  So, a few puts and takes, but overall, I'm pleased with the label be continued modestly positive to underlying growth on the platform as a result of the initiatives that we're driving forward. I'll take that. I'm not going at that myself for 2022. We haven't what the guidance out there, but I'll give us a little bit of color in terms of where we are. As we've previously said, reinvestments in the business is our first priority, whether that's Farrell Boto partner, but having said that, beyond that any excess cash that we do have continues to drive returns.  We'll continue with a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. And this is not any different in the past. We had a strong and consistent history. I've actually noticed some capital returns, and in 2021 must be no exception. So, think about us going from 2 billion at the start of the year, lifting up to 5 billion, and most recently on this call, we're talking about $7 billion.  I think when I stand back and think about eBay as a whole, the balance that we have and the benefits for the franchise, is we often have the ability to do both, in terms of reinvesting the business and the and capital we bought. Hi, Doug. With regards to your question on payments rollout 2022, too early to talk about 2022. We're not taking drive that at this point, but I did want to read, that's why I had delighted we are with the progress we've made with over 90% of the platform volume, with over 18 million sellers joint to the platform now.  We laid out some goals, joining back a couple of years with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue and $500 million of ROI. We're well on track. Margin is in line. So, we're very, very happy with where we are. Thank you, sir. Yeah, thanks Jamie. Tom, I think it's been interesting thing the coming about 4 months now and I think the one thing I would say is just what's rated strengthening the durability of the financial model, with best-in-class margins, really significant value with the ongoing platform and that [Indiscernible] Balance Sheet.  If you take that and you pair it with the structure that Jamie is laid out, and the momentum that we're going forward with, I think anybody franchise translates pretty misunderstood. One of the things that we need to do about a job is just really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better Again, your points is well made.  The momentum is shown on the buyback and capital allocation as we progress through 2021, from the 2 billion to the 5 billion and at the 7 billion is really a source of reflection of that in terms of our thought process around balanced and disciplined capital allocation, and getting that balance right between reinvestment in the business, just the right growth, and providing the very best returns to our shareholders. Hi Dough (ph.), you know, it's not -- it's not about -- I think it's about focus. And I think we're constantly thinking about acquisition of buyers and growth on the platform. And really, it is about really changing our strategy and our focus.  And I just want to reiterate about the value of various buyers bring. So, if I think about our top 20 high-value buyers, or 20% of our buyers, and deliver 75% of our GMV. Nice buyers are making 6 different purchases 6 different times a year and over $800 and net buyers itself.  But the low value buyers, it's about 50% of our -- on that strategy as we continue to evolve the platform, focus on the enthusiasts, focus on cost category selling. But it's very, very important that we continue to have a pipeline as we evolve the business in growth going forward."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will begin the call with key highlights from the third quarter. Then I will share some updates on the progress we're making towards our strategic vision.  At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Q3 was another strong quarter driven by our team's relentless focus on sellers and buyers. I'm excited by the positive impact this is having on the underlying health of the business.  The changes we are making to the marketplace are improving results today and are also putting us in a better position to deliver sustainable growth. We remain confident in our long-term vision to grow the core, become the seller platform of choice, and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter that brought us one step closer to this vision.  Our business delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings growth on the high end of our guidance. Our strategic playbook continues to improve customer satisfaction and build trust and is leading to faster GMV growth in our focus categories.  The managed payments migration, which is nearly complete, is helping sellers and buyers by reducing friction, lowering costs, and enabling new capabilities. Our advertising business continues to grow faster than marketplace volume, and our product innovation provides sellers new tools to help them scale their eBay businesses. We're also making great strides in our ESG effort.  Recently, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative for our multi-year carbon emission reduction goal. And importantly, we announced that eBay will be 100% carbon neutral this year, and will remain so going forward.  I'm pleased to report that all key business metrics either met or surpassed our expectations in Q3. Revenue over-performed growing 10%, driven by acceleration in the payments migration and promoted listings growth. We also delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS at the high-end of expectations while increasing technology investments. GMV performed in line with expectations globally, declining 12% versus last year and increasing 9% compared to 2019.  Excluding transitory macro impacts, we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in the business. Global active sellers remained unchanged at 19 million and total active buyers were 154 million.  Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating and focus categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We've also discontinued legacy couponing that skewed towards low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%.  Another ongoing transformation of our marketplace is managed payments, which progress quickly during the quarter. In Q3, we processed over 90% of on-platform GMV, and remain on track to finish by the end of this year.  I'm thrilled that we're close to migrating all of our global sellers to a next-gen product experience. While we are close to completing the transition, we are only at the beginning of realizing our full payments potential.  Owning the entire seller and buyer journey unlocks opportunities to remove friction, improve trust, and provide new capabilities to sellers and buyers. We are already starting down this path, and here are few examples. Last quarter, we effectively eliminated unpaid items on fixed-price transactions and have continued to reduce this issue for best offers. In the UK, we're paying many sellers as quickly as next business day after buyer payment is confirmed.  Based on community feedback, we've reduced another pain point for trusted sellers by increasing protection against fraudulent returns by requiring photos and providing returns shipping credits. In addition, we continue to improve our stores experience to make eBay the seller platform of choice.  We've been increasing our traffic to stores and providing more CRM capabilities to make managing their businesses on eBay easier than ever. Sellers are leveraging these new features to drive repeat purchases. For example, in only 6 months since launch, more than 2.5 million buyers have completed a repeat purchase from a store using our new seller funded coupons.  To further build sellers brands, we're testing video integration on high traffic pages to help them tell their unique and compelling stories to enthusiast buyers. Our advertising revenue continues to outpace volume due to promoted listings, which drove over $207 million in revenue in Q3 up 9%. We also tested 3 new promoted listings products and are starting to offer these features to more sellers.  In September, we opened up promoted listings, expressed more sellers in the U.S., UK, Germany and Australia. This feature allows sellers to boost visibility of auction listings for a one-time fee, regardless of whether the item is sold.  Early adopters have seen substantial growth in impressions and [Indiscernible]. Last month, we invited eligible sellers to try Promoted Listings Advanced, enabling them to create campaigns on a cost-per-click basis with more budget control. In parallel, we launched a suite of tools to create campaigns, monitor performance, and optimize returns. We're also providing training and webinars to drive trial and adoption.  During Q3, we explored ways to syndicate ads off eBay through external Promoted Listings. Through the eBay partner network, we're testing tools and incentives for affiliates to drive enthusiast buyers to existing Promoted Listings sellers. We are also experimenting with other forms of seller funded marketing across various channels.  Our new advertising products are in the early days, and we're excited about their long-term potential. Moving to our focus categories, I'm pleased with the pace of innovation and the positive reaction from our sellers and buyers. Volume from these categories continues to outperform the rest of the marketplace, and we are increasing customer satisfaction by improving trust.  As you may recall, when we exited last quarter, we had applied our playbook to approximately 10% of global GMV. We remain on track to expand that to roughly 20% by the end of the year. Let me walk you through several examples. Our sneakers business in the U.S. continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates.  During Q3, we launched authentication in Germany, added 30 more brands to our catalog, and improved SEO performance for top sneaker brands. We also lean further into upper funnel marketing and sponsored key industry events to strengthen our reputation with enthusiasts.  Starting tomorrow, we will be trialing a new 3D image capability on select sneaker listing. Leveraging AI and machine learning, the experience will allow buyers to interact with a detailed 360-degree view of the actual item they are buying. We're excited about the potential of this new technology, particularly the ability to reinforce buyer confidence at the point of purchase. Moving to luxury watches, this category is also growing at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. Buyers are finding more inventory on eBay than other marketplaces, as many brands have decreased production and pre -owned supply is limited on other platforms.  Since launching authentication and luxury handbags, growth has accelerated in this category and was positive in Q3, outperforming the total U.S. site by double-digits. We are seeing the same high customer satisfaction as other authenticated categories.  As I've mentioned in the past, part of our strategy is to drive enthusiasts to new trusted experiences, and then leverage those buyers across our vast supply in other categories. The average buyer who purchases sneakers and luxury watches spends approximately $2000 and $8000 respectively in other categories.  We are seeing the exact same behavior in our latest focus category. Buyers of authenticated handbags are spending over $5,000 outside of handbag. This cross-category benefit for sellers and buyers as a unique advantage for eBay.  One of the reasons our growth has improved in luxury categories is the improvement in buyer and seller trust. We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of authenticity guarantee, having now processed over 1.4 million items across multiple categories. Customer satisfaction has consistently exceeded 90%, and we are operating in 5 countries with a mix of in-house and third-party resources.  Another focus category that is driving growth in the U.S. is trading cards, which is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace. In late July, we launched new features, including price guides and collections, which allow trading card enthusiasts to view, manage, and track the value of their portfolios. To date, close to 4 million cards have been added to customer collections.  In addition, close to a quarter of a million buyers have used eBay's newly-launched price guide to visualize the changing value of their favorite trading cards. These features cater to the needs of high-value enthusiasts and are increasing engagement and trust in eBay. The next focus category we're applying the innovation playbook to is motors parts and accessories. [Indiscernible] creating a one-stop shop for vehicles and plus enthusiasts.  We're excited by the potential of bringing together one of the world's largest vehicle selections with hundreds of millions of parts in one customized experience. We're exploring further changes to parts and accessories that leverage our strong market position to capture more untapped growth.  ESG remains critical to our business health and to our customers, and I am pleased to announce that we have reached some significant milestones in our journey toward establishing eBay as the leading sustainability Company in e-commerce.  Just 2 weeks ago, we announced that our emission reduction goals were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We will reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90 [Indiscernible] this designation available and align. Additionally, we reduced value chain emissions from downstream transportation by 20% in the same timeframe.  To reduce emissions from goods shift using our platform, we will partner with our logistics providers to encourage low-carbon alternatives. I'm also proud that eBay will be carbon-neutral for our offices and data centers in 2021. We expect to maintain this going forward as we continue efforts to reduce our overall carbon footprint. At eBay, one of our core values is to be for everyone. As part of this focus, supporting our Seller Community is critically important.  Earlier this month, we issued a new report on equitable entrepreneurship, which revealed how selling on eBay helped women during the pandemic. We found that 82% of women who are new to eBay or increase their selling did so because of job loss, reduction of income, illness, loss of childcare, or some other hardship.  This vast majority of when women surveyed, says the ability to sell on eBay was a benefit during the pandemic, citing the need to earn additional income for themselves or drive revenue for their businesses.  I'm proud that our platform can provide flexibility and opportunity to so many during tough times so that they can earn extra income through selling on our marketplace. I'm also inspired by the continuous generosity of sellers and buyers on eBay.  During Q3, approximately $35 million was raised through eBay for charity, up 11%. Additionally, thousands of global employees help select small businesses to receive grants totaling $3 million from the eBay foundation.  These grants are focused on serving underrepresented entrepreneurs and are used to provide training, coaching, and mentorship needed to help their businesses thrive. In closing, as I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 was yet another strong quarter.  We continue to make progress on our multi-year journey, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Enthusiasts are responding to innovation in our focus categories and are increasingly putting their trust -- putting up new capabilities for sellers and buyers.  Our advertising business is innovating by providing a portfolio of tools our sellers can leverage to build and grow their businesses on eBay and setting and achieving ambitious climate goals and providing a platform where economic opportunity is available to all. I want to thank our passionate employees who have tirelessly work to bring our vision and purpose in life. Their dedication to serving sellers and buyers is inspiring.  Their relentless execution is driving innovation and making eBay a better marketplace, and I couldn't be prouder to be in this team. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yeah. I'll take that. First on the categories, it really is about both leading into the high-value buyers that are on the platform, as well as attracting new buyers in. If you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or -- this quarter we announced what is the cross-category nature of shopping.  So, if we acquire a buyer into a handbag, who buys a handbag over $500, they actually end up spending $5,000 dollars in other categories outside of handbags on the site. So, when we think about acquisition, it's not just acquiring it for that category, it's acquiring it more broadly for eBay. That's one of our significant benefits.  Excited because we've expanded categories this quarter, we brought our sneakers authentication program to Germany. We brought watches to the UK business, and we launched handbags in the U.S. in terms of that product.  From a certified refurbished, we added new brands, [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] and expanded number of products there, and that's exciting coming into holiday. On your question on marketing, we've really shifted our marketing.  I think traditionally we've been a mostly lower funnel with some broad-based campaigns on upper funnel, really driving into how do we inquire high -- acquire high-value buyers and high-value enthusiast in specific verticals.  So, what that means is a whole lot more of upper funnel marketing partnerships, leaning in with social media influencers in certain categories, and basically going much broader with our marketing plans to find those buyers where they are. And I guess the last thing I'd say is we're really focused on the first 90-day experience on eBay.  Many times, in my career, I've done this where you really get focused on how do you introduce them to the brand, bring them up to life cycle, make sure that they turn into the high-value buyers that we want to do. And that's going to be a continued focus for us over the coming quarters. Thanks for the question, Colin. So, we do talk a lot about the vertical expansion and focus category work that we're doing and we're excited for what's happening there. If you actually step back and look at it, the vast majority of our resources are actually going to site-wide initiatives across the board.  And I'd point to a couple of, one is obviously our ad business, and a lot of investment there across-the-board, especially with the 3 new products that we're at the beginning of launching. Obviously, payments, huge initiative. But other areas that we haven't talked a lot about, like eBay stores.  So, working on a next-gen experience in eBay stores, incorporating videos, so allowing sellers to tell their story from that perspective. But a more CRM tool capability so that sellers can be more involved in how we bring buyers back to the platform and drive that repeat business.  So, the stat I just mentioned earlier about, we launched it 6 months ago, but now sellers are funding the coupons to drive buyers back to the site from past buyers or interested buyers. And that's a huge benefit for sellers and a huge benefit for eBay because we're involving them and driving them, and already 2.5 million buyers have used that in that time period.  And so, we're also testing a new selling experience. You -- if you're on the site, you'll see that there's a beta out there of a new way to sell. So most of the -- the vast majority investments are going to horizontal. But what I like is it's a compliment.  Because some of those horizontal lean into some of the vertical work that we're doing in the vertical work and focus categories. Some of the things that we're building for a given category, we're able to use in a number of categories across the site. The 2 also play together well. Steve I'll let you take the second part of the question. Yes. On the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just explain the 3 in details. The first one which is Express, is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions. Since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really only applied to fixed price. And so, this opens up your wallet smaller format at the site of format that has not been open to advertising before.  Promoted Listings Express is a C2C -based product. Gives sellers the opportunity to drive more velocity, goes after a different type of marketing budget for that perspective and given us the opportunity to work with a secondary and supplementary advertising format.  And the third is off eBay advertising, and that's using the vast marketing reach that eBay does today, partnering with our sellers to drive advertising as part of that off eBay outreach to bring existing buyers and new buyers back to the platform.  I will say for you is that it's early days on these 3 products. If you look back, we started our ad business 5 years ago and we've grown to a billion dollars now over 5 years. So, we're at the point now where we're testing, we're learning.  We've got invited sellers into the program. And just like it took us time to build up the CPA based program, I think it will take us time here to build up the advertising program. In terms of penetration, we still have a lot of opportunity left, both in terms of the sellers and Listings.  I believe the last that we shared was that only 400 million of the Listings have advertising associated with them. So, there's a lot of opportunity for additional penetration. I'll let Steve take the second question about how we're thinking about the future. Yes. Let me start with U.S. versus international. First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-two-year basis, based on the strategic vision we impacted by mobility returning to really pre-COVID levels, coupled with an unprecedented in snapback in travel and leisure activities in Europe. In addition, as Steve mentioned a little bit earlier, our international cross-port trade.  Trade sellers were also pressured by supply chain disruptions that tends to be more in our international segment from across border perspective than in our U.S. segment. On the other hand, in the U.S., we've seen strong growth driven by momentum in our core business. To your question on the focus categories, it's not a structural change. We actually think the work we're doing applies across the whole globe, it's really a timing thing.  In most of these areas, we actually roll them out in the U.S., get them perfected here and then expand them internationally. For example, Sneakers is just now launching this quarter in Germany, we launched watches in the U.S. We just started that expansion in the UK this quarter, handbags we just launched in the U.S. and that hasn't expanded yet.  So, it's really a timing thing, but we think the playbook that we have is relevant in every single market that we have. Probably with the exception of trading cards and collectibles. That's just so much stronger in the U.S. than it is internationally, but that's a huge U.S. benefit and a lot of the pieces that we're doing there are our key focus for that.  But overall, feel great about the health of the business and our ability to expand those focus categories internationally. On your second question on P&A, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, but I will say that if you just step back and look at the market, we're in a leading position in P&A, especially in UK and in Germany.  It's a very strong category and a very strong franchise there. It's the key part of our path that we talked about last quarter, of going from 10% of the site to 20% of the site. It's a strong category for eBay because of the vastness of parts and accessories that we have.  We actually do a fairly good job with fitment. I talked last quarter about my garage feature and how we've expanded that internationally, which helps with fitment. We also recently announced a motorcycle parts finder in that business.  And it tends to help and be benefit also from a cross-border trade. To give you a sense of scale, we've got hundreds of millions of listings in our parts business. And what I'm excited by is one of the first evolutions that we did was take all of that inventory and make it available on our motor's app, which is a dedicated separate app for vehicle enthusiasts.  And now you've got vehicles and parts and accessories in a One Stop Shop from that perspective. So, you'll continue to hear further updates from us about that category. It's our next big category focus and one where we're coming into it from a position of strength. Yeah. First on the friction, the whole idea of bringing commerce and payments together gives us great opportunities to remove friction. So, on the selling side, people now only have to set up for single account and get selling.  All of their claims are managed in one place. Tons of benefits from there. One of the ones that I'm really excited by is that since I worked at eBay, the last time starting in 2001, unpaid items have been on this platform forever.  And so now, we've eliminated it and fixed-price virtually. We're doing so in best offer. And so, sellers won't have to face that issue, and it takes friction out of the platform. On the buy-side, it allows us to open up new opportunities for different forms of payments.  Clearly, we've already integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, but we launched the partnership with After pay in our Australia business for buy now, pay later. After pay is a very strong brand in that market. And that's bringing us new customers. It's already at 10% of our business there. And we're continuing to look at new opportunities for forms of payment for our buyers.  Secondarily is on the seller financing -- payments through the business. So, like I said in the call, the way I look at it, the migration is complete, but we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity of what we can do with commerce and payments together in a single flow -- in a single experience. Yes. On the first question, on auction by density, no, we're not seeing an impact from that. Frankly, that format has actually been really strong because of the strength we're seeing collectibles where it tends to be a more used format.  And I'm excited that we are starting to launch Express because that will give our auction sellers the ability to drive some more visibility for them and then to have a tool that they haven't been able to use before. In terms of the shipping services, this has been a constant march for us.  Last year, we expanded in the U.S. to have USPS, UPS and FedEx in there and did the same thing with Royal Mail and Australia Post to greatly exceed the amount of tracking. On the specific shipping test that's going on, now, it's kind of too early to tell. What I would say in general is how to think about this, Brian, is I'm trying to get the whole Company focused on how do we make things as simple and as easy to do on the platform.  So, what we're doing with our new seller flows, with computer vision and trading cards is how do we take all of the work out of the listing process. We're trying to do the same type of thing with our sellers and the stores product and making it really easy to get that setup on the platform. Shipping is one of those areas where there's an opportunity to take a lot of the friction out.  The new partnerships that we've created, the integrated tracking, the smoother returns process is all part of this evolution of just make the whole platform so much easier to use. And so, we'll keep you posted on how these tests roll out, but I'm happy with the progress so far. Yeah. On the first one, look, I've been talking since last July about the game changing level of trust on the platform. And we've been doing that kind of category by category. So, the authentication that we've been doing in the luxury categories really takes trust off the table.  These 2-year warranties that we put in place for certified refurbished does the same thing. And eBay actually has a good size business and industrial business in capital equipment, and [Indiscernible] allows us to put a whole different level of trust in there.  They're a long-time seller in partner on eBay and the capabilities that they will bring to that category will help bring a new level of trust and just help buyers and sellers in that category move forward. So that's what I would say I'm going to do. On the C2C, it's really just a lapping of the COVID dynamics that we saw from last year, in terms of time period and just some of the macro dynamics.  What I'd tell you is I'm really happy with the progress and continue to be a huge focus for us is on our C2C selling experience, bringing them onto the platform making it as extremely easy, making that payment sign-up process really, really simple.  And so that's going to continue to be something that we're going to focus on quarter-after-quarter because as I mentioned in the past, we -- when we talk about high-value buyers, that includes buyers themselves.  By nature, it helps drive them up their buyer cohort curves as well as bringing that unique inventory. So, we're going to continue to push forward there. And then Steve, do you want to take the last one? Yeah. On your first question, it's a very early test in pilot that we're doing. But the idea is we want buyers to be able to see in real detail, the actual item that they're going to be buying. So, you're going to see us launching a couple of sneakers in the coming weeks using this. It's a very early pilot that we're doing with Select Sellers.  But it's all about building trust on the platform. I bought a $4 thousand OBO on the platform last year and it was great. I can see a lot of images, but the opportunity to really get in there in 3D and then see what a [Indiscernible] product looks like is an interesting opportunity. So, like I said, it's very real, you will start to see some products that we had.  I'm using that technology, but I'm -- what I'm excited by is, like the innovation in computer vision, we're using our AI resources and computer vision resources here to do some interesting things that over time, I think will really change the buying experience on eBay. To your question on C2C, it looks pretty consistent in terms of them coming on to the platform continuing to list, and then turning into buyers. You know what I'd say is -- the other thing is that a lot of our business sellers actually started out as C2C sellers.  So, it's another reason we lean in there. I was visiting with a seller years ago. He had an extra set of tires, sold them on eBay, and then just started selling a couple of more things in tires and [Indiscernible] that's helped a lot of our B2C sellers actually get their start on the platform. Yes. On the first one, the off eBay advertising product, let me separate that from the affiliate advertising we do [Indiscernible] -- form and be an affiliate. But the 2 definitely work hand-in-hand together. The whole vision there is really connecting enthusiasts to sellers.  So being out on the platforms where those enthusiasts star and letting our sellers partake in that advertising type thing by putting really interesting items in front of those enthusiasts of driving that marketing, because eBay has been doing this marketing. And when we do it in cooperation with our sellers it gives us a really broad reach.  For sellers It gives them another tool as well, to take all the great inventory that they have on eBay and put it out in front of sellers. And various communities, to really drive that traffic to their business on eBay. I'll let Steve take the second one and maybe I'll maybe I'll add on a bit Actually, it ties in well with your first question, Dan, about the off eBay advertising product is, how do we make sure we're in those places where actually going to apply those high-value enthusiasts.  And putting our -- but much more focus on how we turning buyers in the high-value enthusiasts, and how we're altering our marketing plans so that were out there actually acquiring them onto the platform, because that's what drives the real health of the businesses, is the growth of those high-value buyers and how we're doing in connecting those enthusiasts. So good question because the 2 really tie together."

With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today I'll begin the call with key highlights from the second quarter. Then I will share some updates on the progress towards our strategic vision. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, our new CFO, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The second quarter of 2021 marked several important milestones in the ongoing transformation of eBay. I want to thank our team for making it happen.  We've accelerated our pace of innovation while executing several complex transactions. Their dedication and focus have created tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. Let me start with a few of our portfolio enhancements. We completed the transition of eBay's classified business to Adevinta. This deal was originally valued at approximately $9.2 billion, but closing in June had appreciated to 13.3 billion.  Shortly after closing, we announced the deal with [Indiscernible] to sell approximately 135 million of our [Indiscernible] shares for over $2.4 billion. This agreement fulfills regulatory commitments while returning value to eBay shareholders. We also increased our share buyback plan for the year from $2 billion to $5 billion. In June, we announced the sale of over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion, bringing together two meeting e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock significant potential in Korea.  We anticipate the deal will close either later this year or in early 2022. These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward. When I spoke to you last July, I outlined a renewed vision and strategic plan for the Company. We set out on a multi-year journey to become the best global marketplace for sellers and buyers through a tech lead reimagination. Our priorities were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers, and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers by turning them into enthusiasts. To date, our progress is very encouraging, our underlying growth is positive, and the strategy is working.  Q2 results were strong and all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations. Revenue grew 11% driven by an acceleration in the payments' migration and advertising growth. We funded incremental investments in product development while delivering $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS above the high end of our range. As expected, GMV declined 11% compared to last year when results were heavily impacted by the initial pandemic lockdown. Importantly, compared to prepare endemic levels two years ago, we're seeing positive underlying GMV growth. Our customer metrics remain healthy on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 5% to 19 million globally.  As more small businesses and consumers continue to turn to eBay's global platform to reach millions of potential customers from around the world. This quarter, global active buyers totaled 159 million, down 2% versus last year, and up 3% versus 2019. We have been focused on building lifelong trusted relationships with enthusiast buyers. Changes in our marketing mix and product investments have been focused on attracting and retaining these enthusiasts, particularly, Gen Z and millennials. In parallel, we have discontinued legacy tactics that led to low-value infrequent or one-and-done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy.  These high-value buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher-quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term. Moving on from buyer trends, the payments and advertising initiatives continue to deliver a simpler product experience, and meaningful benefits for sellers, buyers, and shareholders. Managed payments are now live in every market globally, and the transition is progressing faster than expected. During the second quarter, we processed 71% of on-platform volume through managed payments.  We exited Q2 at a run rate of over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter. Managing the payments experience ourselves enabled us to eliminate a pain point that seller occasionally faced on eBay, unpaid items. Changes to checkout have been made to address this issue, and today, 99% of fixed-price transactions are paid upfront. We have also started to address this issue for best offers and auctions by asking buyers to provide a payment method in order to bid. This is a significant win for sellers as it frees up inventory and reduces their post-transaction costs. Our advertising business continues to perform well.  In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by [Indiscernible] listings, which delivered almost $224 million up 8%, more than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements that increase conversion. We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing promoted listings offerings and from new product innovations. Following a number of successful trials in Q2, we are scaling several new products globally over the next few months.  Previously, sellers could only promote fixed-priced listings, but now they can increase visibility for a flat fee on auctions to increase conversion. In June, we also introduced a Cost per Click ad product to sellers in our major markets. Initial results from the first 100,000 listings showed that sellers' return on ad spends with higher than industry benchmarks. We're placing more AI-powered recommendations for pricing and keyword bidding into the Seller Hub to help sellers drive predictable volume. Finally, we are beginning to syndicate ads off eBay's platform to drive more buyers to listings.  Importantly, sellers maintain control of pricing invisibility while benefiting from the scaled marketing capabilities of eBay. In addition to advertising and payments, we are driving a number of other site-wide initiatives. For consumer sellers, we're simplifying the selling process with a heavy focus on mobile. This includes easier label printing solutions in the app and faster listing through image or barcode scans. In trading cards, where we first launched image-based listing, sellers [Indiscernible] are able to match scans over 80% of the time. The time it takes to create a listing has been dramatically reduced and we plan to expand the capability to more product categories later this year. For Small Business sellers, we continue to expand and optimize their eBay toolkit. To help drive repeat businesses from enthusiasts to eBay stores, we built a CRM tool that enables sellers to fund and distribute their own coupons. Since launching a few months ago, over 1 million buyers have purchased items through these targeted campaigns. As you've heard me say in the past, we are focused on a number of categories where we are well-positioned to serve both sellers and buyers. These categories are growing significantly faster than the overall business, and I'm delighted with the progress our team is making.  Our innovation playbook has included increasing customer satisfaction, improving trust, growing supply, and marketing to enthusiasts. As we exited Q2, we have applied this playbook to approximately 10% of our volume across our top 3 markets. With our current plan and ongoing momentum, we expect to expand coverage to approximately 20% by the end of the year. One of these categories is trading cards. In North America, we continue to see substantial growth with approximately $2 billion of GMV in the first half of the year, equal to all of 2020.  Despite these strong results, we see additional untapped potential in the market that we plan to capture with further innovation. We recently launched a price guide and collection tools aimed at trading card enthusiasts. These new features leverage unparalleled inventory and pricing data, allowing customers to view, manage, and track the value of their collections in real-time. As a leader in trading cards with 25 years of transactional data, no one is better positioned to estimate the value of every card ever sold.  In addition, the collection tool seamlessly tracks all eBay activity and offline inventory in one place. This makes it easy for enthusiasts to assess opportunities, quickly trade, and increase the value of their collections. Sneakers and watches continue to outgrow our overall marketplace. Since launching one year ago, we have authenticated nearly 1 million items, enabling a game-changing level of trust. Both categories are seeing close to 90% customer satisfaction rates on authenticated transactions. Our sneakers business saw strong double-digit growth, despite tougher comps from a year ago.  And based on the success, we have expanded sneaker authentication to the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Luxury watches are also sustaining double-digit growth, improved by our trust is leading to strong cross-category shopping behavior similar to what we have seen in sneakers. In fact, luxury watch buyers spend $8,000 on more than 50 items in other categories, well above the average eBay buyer. The next luxury category we were focused on is handbags. We plan to leverage a similar playbook from watches and sneakers to deliver a higher NPS for buyers and sellers.  We have started in the U.S., by authenticating handbags over $500 from major brands. Refurbished electronics continues to be another area of growth across our largest markets. Our certified refurbished experience is strengthening relationships with best-in-class brands by opening new sales channels. We recently welcomed Samsung Galaxy to the program, providing eBay buyers access to exclusive like new products, at exceptional prices. Vehicles, parts, and accessories have historically been one of the strongest performing categories on eBay and remain so today.  Our platform offers a wide inventory selection supported by a robust catalog. The fitment shopping experience matches car parts to vehicles to help buyers shop efficiently and confidently. In Q2, we expanded this capability by enabling a motorcycle parts finder in Germany and the U.K. We also expanded my garage feature, which allows buyers to store their vehicle data, leading to a more tailored shopping experience in Canada, Italy, France, and Spain. We plan to launch more technology-driven innovations in this category later this year to further build on our success.  Taking a step back, eBay exists to create economic opportunity for all, that purpose guides our approach to our customers, our communities, and our team at eBay. This year, our leadership team's individual goals focused on accelerating meaningful change in diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout every level of our Company. We formed an ESG Council composed of senior leaders across the Company whose role is to guide and ensure the success of sustainability initiatives. During the quarter, we published our 5th annual impact report and 3rd annual diversity, equity, and inclusion report, detailing the progress we made in the past year, as well as outlining our 2025 goals.  The full list of activities is extensive, but I would like to share a few highlights. We made progress on our journey to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. Our communities of inclusion have conducted 150 events with more than 10,000 attendees in the past year. We have also continued multi-year efforts to ensure gender pay equity, resulting in 100% pay parity in the U.S. and 99.7% globally. Another priority is managing our environmental impact. Investing in clean energy is a focus for the Company and our goal is to source 100% renewable energy by 2025, we have already reached 74% of our goal through a combination of power purchase agreements and local programs.  Just last week, we announced that we are teaming up with McDonald's in an agreement with light source BP to purchase power from Louisiana's largest solar project. The electricity produced will be greater than the power used at our largest data center. Finally, I would like to call up the incredible generosity of our buyers and sellers. During Q2, customers contributed over $35 million to their favorite course through eBay for charity. This represented a 16% growth versus last year. And the platform is on track to hit the 2025 goal of raising $600 million. These are just a sample of the ongoing ESG related activities and I encourage you to check out more at eBay Inc.com.  Q2 was another step forward in the multi-year transformation of eBay. The business delivered strong results, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Customers are delighted with the innovation in our focus categories, leading to volume growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. We are harnessing the power of next-gen technology to make eBay the seller platform of choice, and to attract lifelong enthusiasts. Our payments transition is nearly complete, delivering benefits to sellers, buyers, and shareholders.  Our advertising product portfolio is expanding, giving sellers more tools to grow their business. And we simplified our portfolio, enabling us to focus on the core while creating significant Shareholder value. Our team continues to be relentlessly focused on executing for our customers. I'm delighted to welcome four new exceptional leaders to our executive team this year. In addition, we have hired critical talent in areas such as technology, AI, analytics, and category management.  The teams in place are well-positioned to propel this business forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Before I do, I want to say how excited I am to have another world-class customer-centric leader on our team to help us realize our vision. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie. And thank you all for joining today. I would like to start by saying how excited and honored I am to be at eBay. I would also like to thank Andy for his leadership and guidance during my transition into the role. He has done an excellent job creating value for the Company and leading our finance team over the last couple of years. I'll start on Page 4 of our presentation. We have outlined the impact of moving our Korean business to discontinued operations and our guidance for Q2 Earnings. That's an aggregated level, this would have reduced guidance by approximately 2 points of GMV growth, $400 million of revenue, and $0.02 of EPS.  The Q2 results purely reflect the performance of our continuing marketplace business. On July 13th, we published a Form 8-K that includes the [Indiscernible] historical financial statements back to the start of 2019. These figures provide an apples-to-apples comparison versus our actual results. Excluding Korea, the implied Q2 guidance was between $2.58 billion and $2.63 billion of revenue growing 8 to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was between $0.89 and $0.94 per share, representing a decrease of 5 to 10% year-over-year. Turning to our highlights from the quarter on Slide 5, despite lapping an exceptional quarter last year, we delivered strong operational results.  Revenue grew double-digits, driven by payments and ads. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.99 per share. and our operating margin was 33%. We generated $910 million of free cash flow while returning $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. We generated significant value from our Portfolio as we work to transform eBay. We announced the agreement to sell about 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. We completed the classified transaction for a total value of $13.3 billion, including 2.5 billion in cash, and a 44% stake in Adevinta.  We then reached an agreement to sell a quarter of that stake to Permira for over $2.4 billion in cash. Finally, we increased our estimated 2021 share buyback to $5 billion from an initial 2 billion. Moving to the active part on Slide 6, we exited the quarter with 159 million buyers representing a 2% decrease year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. At the beginning of the pandemic in Q2 last year, we added more than 7 million buyers, our largest quarterly increase over. The [Indiscernible] buyers have matured in line with historical trends.  We are also seeing a reduction in the bias of life-priced items due to Chinese in our marketing mix. As Jamie mentioned, our strategy to attract new-time buyers has changed over the past several quarters. We've intentionally focused our marketing and product innovation on high-value buyers. These include buyers who sell or [Indiscernible], at least six days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base, and they purchase around 75% of our GMV. High-value buyers grew in Q2, as did the spend per buyer. Low-value bars on eBay like approximately half of our buyer base but the only purchase, about 5% of our GMV.  As we drive the strategy, we expect to see a further drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis. But an increase in GMV per buyer over the coming quarters. Moving to Slide 7, in Q2 we delivered $22.1 billion of GMV, down 11% year-over-year. On a spot basis, this represents a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Compared with Q2 of 2019, GMV grew 19% on an FX-neutral basis, and 23% on a spot basis. There were several factors that contributed to the Q2 GMV dynamic. First, we lapped the peak of the early impacts of the pandemic, including the first wave of my ability restrictions, stimulus payments, and supply chain disruptions. Second, there was a meaningful ongoing macro benefit from global mobility, although it was significantly less at the end of the quarter than at the beginning of Q2.  Our underlying business continued to show positive growth from site-wide product experience improvements and category performance. In the U.S. we generated approximately $10 billion of GMV in Q2, down 5% year-over-year. International GMV decreased 16% year-over-year to $12.1 billion. Our U.S. volume [Indiscernible] paced International primarily due to strength in trading cards, as well as benefits from government stimulus earlier in the quarter. Turning to Revenue on Slide 8, our net revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 11% on an FX-neutral basis and up 14% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.5 billion of transaction revenue up 11% year-over-year, mainly driven by payments.  We continue to make great progress on seller migration. As Jamie mentioned, 71% of our global OEM platform volume was processed through managed payments during the quarter, which contributed approximately 18 points of incremental revenue growth year-over-year. The success of the payments ramp also drives the quarterly acceleration of 80 basis points to our transaction take rate, which is 11.3% for the quarter. We expect its rate to continue to grow throughout 2021 as we complete the payments rollout. We delivered $172 million of marketing services and other revenue up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in shipping programs.  While we continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising, the drug on total [Indiscernible] growth rate was less due to easier comps from a year ago. Turning to Slide 9, our major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. this represents a 6-point year-over-year decrease, driven primarily by lower volume. The cost of revenue has increased in line with payments growth due to processing costs. While these variable costs will increase as payments revenue grows, the incremental revenue provides leverage for our fixed expenses.  Most notably sales and marketing, and G&A. Product development costs increased year-over-year as we continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our strategic initiatives. Transaction losses were flat versus the prior year. As the benefits of netting seller fees against our net proceeds were offset by higher customer protection losses. Turning to EPS on slide 10, we delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, flat versus the prior year. Negative impacts from lapping COVID - driven volumes were offset by strategic initiatives, particularly payments, as well as a lower share count related to sharing repurchase.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, a decrease of 56% year-over-year. We elected the fair value accounting method for our investments in [Indiscernible]. The change in stock price between the close of the sale on June 24th, and the quarter-end on June 30th, drive a majority of the GAAP EPS to decrease. In addition, while we recognized further guidance on the Adyen launch in Q2, we're lapping significant guidance in the [Indiscernible] year. Moving to slide 11, we saw another strong quarter of cash generation with $910 million of free cash flow. The 7% year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational results, payments, and improvements in working capital.  This is partly offset by higher cash taxes. Turning to slide 12, we ended the quarter with cash [Indiscernible] investments of $7.6 billion and debt of $9.1 billion. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we completed the [Indiscernible] of our classified business to Adevinta during the quarter, generating cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. We expect to pay cash taxes associated with the sale of approximately $400 million in the third quarter. As a result of our strong underlying free cash flow performance, and the prices from this transaction, we updated our capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing the estimated share buyback to $5 billion. In Q2, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.  We repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of $62.60 per share, amounting to 1.5 billion, and paid a dividend of $121 million. We exited the quarter with $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our Board has approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion with no expiry, raising the total to approximately $7.3 billion. Finally, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes during the quarter, part of which will be used to repay our 2022 debt maturities. Moving to investments on Slide 13 on June 24th, we closed the classified sale and recorded investments on our balance sheet of $10.8 billion to reflect the 540 million shares we received as consideration.  The value of this stake stood at $10.4 billion at quarter-end. By some other venture stock price. Between the announcements of the deal last July and the close of the transaction this June, the value of our equity stake appreciated 61%. As a regulatory condition of the classified sale, we agreed to reduce our ownership stake in another vantage of 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. We recently announced an agreement with Permira to sell approximately 135 million shares for more than $2.4 billion.  This will reduce our ownership stake to 33%. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Turning to Adyen, the ones we acquired in the second quarter of 2018, are valued at $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter. an increase of over $500 million year-over-year. You'll find more information on the [Indiscernible] in our [Indiscernible]. We also want to highlight [Indiscernible] at the end of the second quarter, our investment was worth approximately $300 million. On August the 6th, they completed their IPO, which increased the value of our stake to over 900 million. Finally, on June 24th, we announced plans to sell about 80% of our Korean business to Emart.  We will retain an interest of less than 20% to the implied value of our interest was approximately $800 million at the time of the announcement. We remain excited about all these investments. The optionality they provide, and the significant value they generate for each of our shareholders. Turning to guidance on Slide 14, for Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, growing 6% to 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis, and approximately 7% to 9% on a spot basis. We anticipate payments and advertising, we'll continue to drive revenue to grow faster than volume, leading to type rate expansion.  This revenue guidance implies GMV is down low-to-mid teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up high single-digits compared to 2019. On a spot basis, today's rates would indicate a 2-point benefit versus FX-neutral growth rates in Q3. This is 2 points lower than the 4-point benefit we saw in Q2 GMV. We are [Indiscernible] that macro benefits, including stimulus and my ability, will be significantly less in Q3 than Q2. We also expect our efforts to improve the business will continue to enable modestly positive underlying growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, representing 4% to 9% growth. Year-over-year, we plan to continue investing in products and technology to deliver better [Indiscernible] experiences while improving marketing efficiencies.  We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of 64 to $0.68 per share in Q3. Looking at the full year, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. And we are not providing full-year guidance at this time. However, there are variables within our control that we're sharing in this context. Given the accelerated pace of the transition of the payments, we are raising our full-year forecast for payments revenue from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Payments' margin contribution continues to ramp towards our long-term target of 25%. The total operating margin for the business was expected to land at approximately 33%, which would be close to 150 basis points, better than 2019.  As I mentioned before, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $5 billion in 2021 at this time, which implies an additional $3.2 billion in the second half. In conclusion, during the quarter we delivered strong short-term results ahead of expectations while transforming the Company for the longer term. We are excited about the path forward on the growth potential of eBay. Innovation is leading to volume growth and our focus categories, despite tougher comps from a year ago. Our payments and advertising initiatives are driving better customer experience, resulting in incremental revenue and earnings growth.  Our balanced approach to cost management allows us to reinvest in our customers while delivering high margins with low capital intensity. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow and return value to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Our portfolio simplification has created over $20 billion of shareholder value, allowing us to intensely focus on growing the core.  As a purpose-driven Company, we're enabling economic opportunity for all, while supporting our people, our communities, and our planet. I would like to once more take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their tremendous work at the last quarter and for their support for our buyers and sellers in the eBay community. We will now take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction] [Operator Instructions] Please, standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question, Jamie, I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your buyer strategy. It sounds like we should expect that maybe that metric is under pressure the next couple of quarters. But what sort of underlies that the strategy around focus, around that, that's 20% of the buyer base.  And I guess relatedly with the portfolio improvements in streamlining the business, does this enhance your ability to execute more rapidly going forward? And maybe just the last one for Steve would love to hear a little bit more about your thought process and what -- what drove you to the business, given it's a little bit different from your prior background. Thanks very much.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first on the buyer strategy, this is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech lead reimagination as being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in 2019, where it was really just about the number of active buyers, even low-value buyers, or one and done buyers.  I've got the whole organization pivoted to focusing on those high-value buyers, buyers that are buying over $800, buying 6 times a year, or buyers who sell, and so as you think about these buyers, they are so strong at EBITDA. 20% of them, they make up 75% of GMV. and the goal is, how do we turn more buyers into these lifelong enthusiasts? I've met a lot of these buyers, they wake up and they get a cup of coffee, and they turn to eBay and open the eBay app.  And our focus is really not on just the total number, but really focused on how are we driving these buyers to become enthusiasts? The metrics that we show in the Board deck, are [Indiscernible] 12-month metric. So, we're obviously lapping the buyers that we acquired in Q2. But going forward, our focus will really be on these long-term enthusiasts.  So, I'm excited to say that their GMV is growing. They're growing as a population, and more and more, you're going to see us doing things to drive that longevity because we know the things that move buyers up the cohort curve into long-term buyers. On your second question on the portfolio, absolutely. A huge part of the portfolio simplification is about being able to focus on the marketplace, and as Steve talked about, we generated $20 billion in value for shareholders starting with the StubHub transaction. But I think more importantly now, it enables us to focus all of our attention on the Marketplace business. As I've talked about, we see a lot of growth opportunities in that business. The strategy that we have is working. We're in year one of a multi-year re-imagination of eBay.  But if you look at what we talked about a second ago with the 10% now about to reach 20% of categories. It's really working. Customer satisfaction is at 90, it's leading to a very strong GMV. And we see the same potential for this innovation playbook in every category on the site. And Steve, maybe you want to take the last one.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie. And thank you, Tom, for your question. It's good to meet you this afternoon. I suppose, I [Indiscernible] in two areas, I've [Indiscernible] from two Companies, which were leaders in an industry around customer-centricity and innovation.  And coming over to eBay a Company that's got a real sense of purpose. An amazing team and our hearts around customer-centricity and innovation were some of the core facets that I looked at when I came out to eBay. Since I've been here, it's really clear about the sheer size and scale of the enterprise and what opportunities are ahead of us in terms of its growth.  We really do have incredible durability of the financial model with a fortress balance sheet, best-in-class margins, incredible free cash flow. And even after a few weeks, I feel that the value of the enterprise is really misunderstood because of the potential that's ahead of us and the strategy that Jamie's laid out. So, I'm really excited to be here. I think there are huge opportunities for the enterprise and I'm looking for to my journey over here and eBay\nTom Champion: Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. So, Jamie, I know this question goes back away in terms of what we could be doing once the managed payments are fully deployed. But now we're pretty much at the goal line here, so there have to be pockets of the global demand base. You otherwise could not cater to before, because you just simply could not take their money.  So, what are the prospects of opening up the buyer acquisition funnel to that audience a bit more in those regions? And I guess on the second point, recently, you've launched the fulfillment service in the U.K. with a partner. So, can you talk about what kind of improvement you think you may see to either conversion rates and the buyer experience as you step up the level of service for the buyers in the country? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks for the question. On the first one we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%, that it opens up even more opportunities for us from a, how do we service our buyers and sellers? So, some examples of things that we've already launched, for example, is we launched a partnership with After pay as an additional form of payment in Australia, allowing people in that market to pay with installments.  It's very strong in Australia, and that's certainly helped us in Australia business. In our U.K. business, we've launched a partnership that allows us to do seller financing and help sellers out there. And we'll continue to expand in different ways throughout the globe on more opportunities around managed payments.  The other big one that I talked about earlier is that now that commerce and payments are one, and we can manage all of that on eBay, there's a lot of friction we can take out of the platform, so unpaid items are a great example where for 25 years since I was here the first time, sellers have had to face items where buyers wouldn't pay. We've now eliminated that in the 99% of options on our way to do that in best price -- I'm sorry, the best offer in auctions. We've eliminated fixed price on our way to do it, is the best offer in auctions.  And two weeks ago, we had eBay open with thousands of sellers online and we announced this. And it was massive rejoicing from them because this has been a key pain point. So, the other thing I'm excited about is just eliminating those pain points. On your question on the fulfillment service, what we saw in the U.S. and especially in our cross-border trade, coming out of Greater China, for example, is the ability to forward-deployed inventory is a benefit because of the predictability that it gives to buyers from that standpoint.  We're using it to help scale small businesses, to drive the ability to have for deployment. And basically, pass those savings onto the customer. So, we're just getting started with that program, but we've learned a lot about cross-border trade and, and we're excited that fulfillment services are going to help scale some of our small businesses and in their cross-border inventory.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael [Indiscernible] with Bank of America.\nMichael McGovern: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may, the first just on promoted listings, it looked like they were -- so the promoted listings revenue is on change quarter-on-quarter. So, there's a bit of a deceleration.  I was just wondering if there was anything to call out specifically for that in Q2? And then secondly, looking at the decline in sold items, it looks like the sold items were down by more than the GMV was down. And looking back to last year, GMV grew more than sold items last year. So, it looked doesn't look to be driven by comps. So, is there anything to call out for the decline in sold items for Q2 as well? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So, on the first one on Promoted Listings, no, that business is doing well, we frew it 8% in the quarter, despite the volume being down 11. And we actually are starting to scale up a couple of pilots that we launched in Q2. Specifically, ads for auctions, what we're calling Promoted Listings Express, which is a CBC business.  And then -- and off eBay advertising business. So, we continue to see lots of potential in that business, and these 3 areas are just getting started. On the sold items, that's really a reflection of the purposeful decisions that we've made, to one is moving away from low-value items that weren't driving the type of return and low-value buyers specifically, as well as a shift to higher ASP in general because of the strategy to focus categories strategy working.  So, we talked about the strength that we're seeing in trading cards and collectibles. Already having done $2 billion this year, the same as all of last year. Really driving our C2C business, and C2C tends to have a higher ASP. Our higher average selling price than our B2C business. And so that's also driving kind of that dynamic. so, it's actually in line with what -- with where we wanted to be, we think it's healthy for the ecosystem, and we think it's going to continue to be driven that way because C2C, as we look at it, we hope to continue to outpace B2C and lean in on these categories of value, like our luxury goods collectibles, et cetera.\nMichael McGovern: Okay. That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome, Steve. I guess jimmy first just wanted to follow up on the buyer strategy. I'm just trying to figure out how we should think about that, ultimately translating into marketplace growth, and is there going to be, for example, an extended period of decay in those fewer active users before the marketplace essentially normalizes, and then you can show growth. And then, secondly, I guess more housekeeping, in terms of, what was behind the acceleration and the move to manage payment stream, Q2? It seems like you may be about a quarter or 2 ahead of plan there, if I have the metrics right Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So, on your first question on the buyer strategy. Yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers who are kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyer. If you remember back in 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-month metrics, some of those numbers are actually still in our numbers even from 2019. But the reason I'm focused on is if you look at that 50% of buyers, they only contribute 5% of GMV. And the top 20% contribute 75%.  And so, by focusing the organization not on just how many buyers do we have on the platform, but how many of our buyers are we turning into these high-value buyers? We think that's much healthier for the growth of the platform in the long term, much healthier for sellers, et cetera.  Jive's better with the marketing strategies that we're going after while we're really focused on the first 90 days of a customer and getting them up to their lifecycle. So, this is going to be a purposeful strategy you are going to see us on for years, walking away from the work that we did back in 2019, what when you ask about the managed payments, what I'm really happy about is the execution from the team. If you look at when we started, for example, enabling greater China, we got to 90% penetration within 10 weeks.  And so, we took the learnings from what started two years ago with the U.S. and Germany, and we've learned a lot as we've rolled out all of the other countries. And that pace speaks to the -- the pace of execution of the team and what they're doing and another, a lot of questions of what we'd be able to even reach the targets we had for next year originally. And I'm just excited that we're ahead of schedule and we're starting to do things like the After pay and the seller financing because there's just a lot of potential for this business as we fully manage the payments by -- all through eBay.\nColin Sebastian: Okay. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEdward Yruma: Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions today, I guess first you guys have made a big push into authentication as part of your focus on some of these vertical enthusiasts\u2019 communities. And I know -- or we believe that a lot of this is done on an outsource basis, I guess at some point, you need to bring this in-house and kind of how scalable are your current authentication solutions.  And then kind of broadly speaking, it seems like you guys have been fairly innovative with adding more functionality to eBay stores. What is the uptake been of the subscription product and kind of what does the product roadmap look like from here? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited at how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication too, for sneakers to U.K., Australia, and Canada. This quarter we announced that we're authenticating handbags over $500 in the U.S. And we're using a mixture of third-party and in-house resources to do so.  But what we're seeing is that this authentication has a great ROI. What it's able to do in terms of driving GMV, driving new buyers into the site. I will just give you -- I'll reiterate the stat we talked about last quarter in sneakers, which is acquiring a Gen Z, they buy $500 in sneakers, but they buy $2,000 in other categories on the site. We're seeing the same thing in watches, where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches, and that's over 50 items.  And that's one of the benefits of eBay, is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate. On eBay stores, we talked about being the seller platform of choice and a big part of that is our strategy of really growing eBay stores. This quarter we announced a new program where it's much simpler to set up your eBay store. And I'm really excited by one of the features the team now -- announced, which was the ability for a seller to send coupons to repeat buyers. So, this is something that sellers have been asking for.  We built it in as part of the store's platform. And in just a few short months since launch, that product already has 1 million buyers taking advantage of those coupons from sellers. So, another thing that -- as we had our big eBay open event 2 weeks ago, our sellers were really excited. And frankly, we're just getting started on that program. so, we're even continuing to make sellers aware of these new capabilities. So, you'll continue to see quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year innovation on eBay Stores because it's an important part of our strategy.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, two questions on the model here. You've got about a 10-point easier comp for GMV on an [Indiscernible] basis. In the third quarter and you're calling for a little bit more? re-sell? from here. So, do we chalk that up to a kind of purging some of the low-quality buyers and that chunk of that 25% of GMV that they represent or is that just the macro is kind of dropping off any color on that would be great? And then your 33% operating margin for 2021, that's got the brunt [Indiscernible] payment ramp in there. So, as we look ahead to '22 and we expect GMV to start growing again, how should we think about that operating margin? Like what are the puts and takes on that going up or going down next year? Thanks a lot.\nSteve Priest: hey, we got Steve here. [Indiscernible] So I'll start off with -- the second quarter. And as it relates to everything else on an Apples -- Apple basis, we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all of the major metrics. We laid out our Q3 - third-quarter guidance, and obviously, that reflects the best view based on what we're seeing in our most recent trends in the first part of the quarter. And our latest outlook on my ability.  And this is actually an unchanged view versus what we communicated when me [Indiscernible] in the second quarter and what we indicated was that we expected the second half GMV growth will be similar to Q2 as the Asia comps will be offset by lower macro benefits in 2021 as some mobility got back to normal and we are seeing some of that, in particular, a couple of our key markets in the lights of Germany and the U.K. That underpins that.  And again, we still to -- when we look through that lens, we expect that to lead to a mid, low-to-mid teen volume declines year-over-year, which actually at the heart of it indicates modestly positive growth from the underlying business on the basis of us continuing to improve the customer experience and execute on the vision that Jamie has a light out. Specifically, with regards to your second question about the 33% operating margin for 2021, obviously, we're ramping payments up.  We talked extensively about the fact that that's actually a lower margin part of the businesses sort of 25%, we've guided our expectations that 2021 will end with that 33%. With our recast financials ties a 150 basis stronger than 2019. So, we're right on track with the margin accretion from all of the initiatives that we're driving forward. We're not guiding 2022 at this point, but I'm very pleased with the trajectory that we're sitting on.\nOperator: Your next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. Jamie, first of all, you spoke about being the platform of choice for sellers, but you've also hit a record transaction take rate of 11.3%, you're suggesting that a rise year-on-year. What's your message to sellers with the notion that they are seeing in terms of their costs on eBay continued to go up as there's been a lot of issues and glitches with working on final value fees and tax and so forth. And then a couple of quick questions for Steve.  Can you give us a bit more detail on the decline in gross margins you mentioned payments on authentication? And also, adjusting for the fair value of both warrants, and equity, and the investments, it looks like free cash flow would have been about a 1/3 lower. So, can you talk about what you're seeing in the underlying free cash flow of the business when we remove all these very noisy investment income and changes in fair value of warrants? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: On your first question, I think is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments. And now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of sellers will actually be paying lower fees when you look at the combined take rate that they pay, because they're no longer paying that separate piece, and it's one single rate. The reason you are still seeing a rise in intake rate and may continue to do so is just because of the ramp of payments. So as payments ramp up, that starts to get reflected in eBay's take rate.  But the seller is no longer paying that PayPal or other forms of payment take rate. The second key -- the second key thing for us is making sure that we return the value to the sellers for the fees that we're charging. And so, when you think about the scaling demand that we can bring in terms of 159 million buyers, in terms of new capabilities that we're bringing to them on the platform, like the ability to go back to repeat sellers. There are areas where we've discounted our fees like sneakers, which has worked out really well in terms of growing those categories.  We look in general at the value that we provide. And I would say in our core business, we actually feel really good about that. And what we're seeing in our advertising business is that the ROEs of the return on ad spend that our sellers are seeing, are actually higher than what they're getting on other platforms. Which also, I think speaks to the value of the demand that we're providing. I'll let Steve take the other questions.\nSteve Priest: Hi Richard, good to meet you remotely. I'll turn off the first question with regards to margins. So, I think about the 3 key areas that the underlying business, there are payments, and then there are the lights of authentication. And so, as a reminder, we laid out the strategy around payments a couple of years ago.  With regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue, $500 million of incremental [Indiscernible] margin, and as Jamie alluded to, that is going very well, the momentum's going well, we've increased the full cost for 2021 to 1.8, [Indiscernible] on the revenue side. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to be on the path for the incremental 150 basis points over two years on our margin story. So, it's not necessarily driving any dilution in the margin story.  It's great from a Net Income standpoint as we go forward. The second point on authentication, Jamie mentioned the return on investment that is providing, it rather de minimus when you look at the overall cost structure in terms of, in fact, less than the half of points of margin is where you go from authentication, but the amounts of stickiness that are providing for our customers when they are going to cost cross-category buying more than pays for itself, and it's an investment that we're really glad we're making as we think about the whole ecosystem and And then the ability for that to move [Indiscernible] -- across categories.  With regard to our free cash flow at an underlying level which generated a free cash flow of $910 million in the quarter. The warrants are not achieved yet, and the free cash flow's investments. What I would say is that we continue to invest in the product as part of our core platform. In terms of the payment\u2019s rollout, which is going extremely well, and other product investments with regards to moving this side forward in the categories that Jamie alluded to earlier. So, we're doing very well in terms of the organization and how we're moving forward, and very happy to follow offline if there are any further questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. To start off, just to follow up on Ross's question. Low-to-mid teens GMV decline in 3Q. Any way you can sort of giving us color on mobility assumptions behind that, should we expect some incremental deceleration in 4Q, or is 3Q sort of the reflection of all potential reversals due to mobility may [Indiscernible] that it's hard to forecast COVID dynamics. But I want to understand your guidance assumptions. And then the second one, you monetized some of your Adevinta stakes, how should we think about the approach with the rest? Is there any specific guidance or timeline that you have in mind? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Good afternoon, Deepak. So, I'll address the first question as you laid an eye in terms of my ability, we have, as I said in my prepared comments, assume that we start to ramp off the significant lockdowns coming from 2020 through '21.  We talked about the fact that mobility, in terms of people getting out and about would increase as we went through the second quarter. And so, as we got into the third, then that's rolling off. In fact, just -- if you look at, particularly, Germany, one of our biggest markets in the U.K., things are pretty much back to normal from my ability standpoint, travels going through the roof. If you look at Search, in terms of leisure activities in travel I think that's as it is going forward.  Obviously, it feels a little different, maybe over here at the moment with regards to the Delta variant, but in that sense, we are missing things where we're expecting that going forward, I'm not going to get beyond quarter 3 Deepak you know because we chose not to guide further than that because of the uncertainty.  But we are [Indiscernible] in the third quarter that things are starting to get back to some normality. And -- and we're not in the lockdown scenario. With regards to the Adevinta transaction, obviously, that was completed. When we think about Adyen and Korea, whilst we have a great [Indiscernible] transactions and not closed yet.  And obviously, therefore we're not getting into any discussions about the proceeds of [Indiscernible] those transactions until those are closed. So obviously leading into the [Indiscernible] venture Very pleased that we were able to increase the share buyback from 2 billion to 5 billion this year in terms of driving those returns to shareholders. But it's too early to say with regard to the other transactions that have not closed yet.\nJamie Iannone: Okay. Operator, I think we'll take one more, please.\nOperator: Your final question is from Dan Solomon with BMO Capital Markets.\nDan Solomon: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Jamie can come back and review the rollout of Promoted Listings Express and CPC pricing, whatever your key goals there, is it a greater advertiser base, deeper spend per advertiser, and bring more of your sellers in more deeply to the program, any more color on that would be great. And maybe an appropriate last comment for the call, you've mentioned eBay open a seller forum a couple of times here, and some of the pieces [Indiscernible] see back that you got. What would you say were the 2 to 3 most important that you heard from the sellers [Indiscernible]?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first on the Promoted Listings, yeah, the rollout of CBC is really to have additional ad formats and additional capabilities, for sellers to drive visibility of their listings. So, we talked last quarter about how we're only at 1% of GMV. And if you look at other platforms, we think there's significant potential in the kind of low-to-mid single-digit percentage of GMV. The backs of the existing program, where we've already done over a billion dollars, grew 8% this quarter. We're really on a single type of advertising in a single format. So, it was all CPA on fixed price.  So, as we expand now to auctions as we expand to a CPC where we introduce more bidding capabilities for our top spot and search, which just enables sellers to have more tools. So, we're in beta on that product right now, and I would just say in general, we're really excited by what we're seeing because our ROEs are really strong, meaning our buyer experience is performing well, and the return that the sellers are getting on that spend is productive and much more productive than they would get on other platforms. In terms of eBay Open, I think we had a lot of really positive feedback about the unpaid item noise.  I've known sellers forever get frustrated when that happens to them, especially for a new seller. and so, they're really excited that we're tackling that as part of managed payments. I'd say they're really excited by what we're doing in stores and coupons because they want to build their brand on eBay. They want to drive repeat business.  And so, I think they're really excited by that. I'd say the other form that was really well attended and -- and had a lot of excitement was the trading cards forum. The launch of computer vision, where we're driving 80% of the scans is really identifying what the product is and it's simplifying the listing flow. We launched this new my collections, which is a really popular feature for people because they can show up their collections. And we launched a price guide feature which -- eBay has this treasure trove of data in the 25 years of history, nobody has the data that we have. It's a really great asset for us.  So, I'd say that area and those sellers that joined in particular, we're really excited by the innovation that we're making. I love those forums because this platform gets better by listening to our sellers and hearing their feedback. And they give us lots of ideas of things to continue to work on in the tech lead reimagination. So, a great interaction, despite being virtual, they all can't wait to be in person again, like we can, but it was a really good session.\nDan Solomon: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. And thank you all for joining today. I would like to start by saying how excited and honored I am to be at eBay. I would also like to thank Andy for his leadership and guidance during my transition into the role. He has done an excellent job creating value for the Company and leading our finance team over the last couple of years. I'll start on Page 4 of our presentation. We have outlined the impact of moving our Korean business to discontinued operations and our guidance for Q2 Earnings. That's an aggregated level, this would have reduced guidance by approximately 2 points of GMV growth, $400 million of revenue, and $0.02 of EPS.  The Q2 results purely reflect the performance of our continuing marketplace business. On July 13th, we published a Form 8-K that includes the [Indiscernible] historical financial statements back to the start of 2019. These figures provide an apples-to-apples comparison versus our actual results. Excluding Korea, the implied Q2 guidance was between $2.58 billion and $2.63 billion of revenue growing 8 to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was between $0.89 and $0.94 per share, representing a decrease of 5 to 10% year-over-year. Turning to our highlights from the quarter on Slide 5, despite lapping an exceptional quarter last year, we delivered strong operational results.  Revenue grew double-digits, driven by payments and ads. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.99 per share. and our operating margin was 33%. We generated $910 million of free cash flow while returning $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. We generated significant value from our Portfolio as we work to transform eBay. We announced the agreement to sell about 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. We completed the classified transaction for a total value of $13.3 billion, including 2.5 billion in cash, and a 44% stake in Adevinta.  We then reached an agreement to sell a quarter of that stake to Permira for over $2.4 billion in cash. Finally, we increased our estimated 2021 share buyback to $5 billion from an initial 2 billion. Moving to the active part on Slide 6, we exited the quarter with 159 million buyers representing a 2% decrease year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. At the beginning of the pandemic in Q2 last year, we added more than 7 million buyers, our largest quarterly increase over. The [Indiscernible] buyers have matured in line with historical trends.  We are also seeing a reduction in the bias of life-priced items due to Chinese in our marketing mix. As Jamie mentioned, our strategy to attract new-time buyers has changed over the past several quarters. We've intentionally focused our marketing and product innovation on high-value buyers. These include buyers who sell or [Indiscernible], at least six days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base, and they purchase around 75% of our GMV. High-value buyers grew in Q2, as did the spend per buyer. Low-value bars on eBay like approximately half of our buyer base but the only purchase, about 5% of our GMV.  As we drive the strategy, we expect to see a further drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis. But an increase in GMV per buyer over the coming quarters. Moving to Slide 7, in Q2 we delivered $22.1 billion of GMV, down 11% year-over-year. On a spot basis, this represents a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Compared with Q2 of 2019, GMV grew 19% on an FX-neutral basis, and 23% on a spot basis. There were several factors that contributed to the Q2 GMV dynamic. First, we lapped the peak of the early impacts of the pandemic, including the first wave of my ability restrictions, stimulus payments, and supply chain disruptions. Second, there was a meaningful ongoing macro benefit from global mobility, although it was significantly less at the end of the quarter than at the beginning of Q2.  Our underlying business continued to show positive growth from site-wide product experience improvements and category performance. In the U.S. we generated approximately $10 billion of GMV in Q2, down 5% year-over-year. International GMV decreased 16% year-over-year to $12.1 billion. Our U.S. volume [Indiscernible] paced International primarily due to strength in trading cards, as well as benefits from government stimulus earlier in the quarter. Turning to Revenue on Slide 8, our net revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 11% on an FX-neutral basis and up 14% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.5 billion of transaction revenue up 11% year-over-year, mainly driven by payments.  We continue to make great progress on seller migration. As Jamie mentioned, 71% of our global OEM platform volume was processed through managed payments during the quarter, which contributed approximately 18 points of incremental revenue growth year-over-year. The success of the payments ramp also drives the quarterly acceleration of 80 basis points to our transaction take rate, which is 11.3% for the quarter. We expect its rate to continue to grow throughout 2021 as we complete the payments rollout. We delivered $172 million of marketing services and other revenue up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in shipping programs.  While we continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising, the drug on total [Indiscernible] growth rate was less due to easier comps from a year ago. Turning to Slide 9, our major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. this represents a 6-point year-over-year decrease, driven primarily by lower volume. The cost of revenue has increased in line with payments growth due to processing costs. While these variable costs will increase as payments revenue grows, the incremental revenue provides leverage for our fixed expenses.  Most notably sales and marketing, and G&A. Product development costs increased year-over-year as we continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our strategic initiatives. Transaction losses were flat versus the prior year. As the benefits of netting seller fees against our net proceeds were offset by higher customer protection losses. Turning to EPS on slide 10, we delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, flat versus the prior year. Negative impacts from lapping COVID - driven volumes were offset by strategic initiatives, particularly payments, as well as a lower share count related to sharing repurchase.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, a decrease of 56% year-over-year. We elected the fair value accounting method for our investments in [Indiscernible]. The change in stock price between the close of the sale on June 24th, and the quarter-end on June 30th, drive a majority of the GAAP EPS to decrease. In addition, while we recognized further guidance on the Adyen launch in Q2, we're lapping significant guidance in the [Indiscernible] year. Moving to slide 11, we saw another strong quarter of cash generation with $910 million of free cash flow. The 7% year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational results, payments, and improvements in working capital.  This is partly offset by higher cash taxes. Turning to slide 12, we ended the quarter with cash [Indiscernible] investments of $7.6 billion and debt of $9.1 billion. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we completed the [Indiscernible] of our classified business to Adevinta during the quarter, generating cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. We expect to pay cash taxes associated with the sale of approximately $400 million in the third quarter. As a result of our strong underlying free cash flow performance, and the prices from this transaction, we updated our capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing the estimated share buyback to $5 billion. In Q2, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.  We repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of $62.60 per share, amounting to 1.5 billion, and paid a dividend of $121 million. We exited the quarter with $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our Board has approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion with no expiry, raising the total to approximately $7.3 billion. Finally, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes during the quarter, part of which will be used to repay our 2022 debt maturities. Moving to investments on Slide 13 on June 24th, we closed the classified sale and recorded investments on our balance sheet of $10.8 billion to reflect the 540 million shares we received as consideration.  The value of this stake stood at $10.4 billion at quarter-end. By some other venture stock price. Between the announcements of the deal last July and the close of the transaction this June, the value of our equity stake appreciated 61%. As a regulatory condition of the classified sale, we agreed to reduce our ownership stake in another vantage of 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. We recently announced an agreement with Permira to sell approximately 135 million shares for more than $2.4 billion.  This will reduce our ownership stake to 33%. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Turning to Adyen, the ones we acquired in the second quarter of 2018, are valued at $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter. an increase of over $500 million year-over-year. You'll find more information on the [Indiscernible] in our [Indiscernible]. We also want to highlight [Indiscernible] at the end of the second quarter, our investment was worth approximately $300 million. On August the 6th, they completed their IPO, which increased the value of our stake to over 900 million. Finally, on June 24th, we announced plans to sell about 80% of our Korean business to Emart.  We will retain an interest of less than 20% to the implied value of our interest was approximately $800 million at the time of the announcement. We remain excited about all these investments. The optionality they provide, and the significant value they generate for each of our shareholders. Turning to guidance on Slide 14, for Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, growing 6% to 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis, and approximately 7% to 9% on a spot basis. We anticipate payments and advertising, we'll continue to drive revenue to grow faster than volume, leading to type rate expansion.  This revenue guidance implies GMV is down low-to-mid teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up high single-digits compared to 2019. On a spot basis, today's rates would indicate a 2-point benefit versus FX-neutral growth rates in Q3. This is 2 points lower than the 4-point benefit we saw in Q2 GMV. We are [Indiscernible] that macro benefits, including stimulus and my ability, will be significantly less in Q3 than Q2. We also expect our efforts to improve the business will continue to enable modestly positive underlying growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, representing 4% to 9% growth. Year-over-year, we plan to continue investing in products and technology to deliver better [Indiscernible] experiences while improving marketing efficiencies.  We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of 64 to $0.68 per share in Q3. Looking at the full year, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. And we are not providing full-year guidance at this time. However, there are variables within our control that we're sharing in this context. Given the accelerated pace of the transition of the payments, we are raising our full-year forecast for payments revenue from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Payments' margin contribution continues to ramp towards our long-term target of 25%. The total operating margin for the business was expected to land at approximately 33%, which would be close to 150 basis points, better than 2019.  As I mentioned before, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $5 billion in 2021 at this time, which implies an additional $3.2 billion in the second half. In conclusion, during the quarter we delivered strong short-term results ahead of expectations while transforming the Company for the longer term. We are excited about the path forward on the growth potential of eBay. Innovation is leading to volume growth and our focus categories, despite tougher comps from a year ago. Our payments and advertising initiatives are driving better customer experience, resulting in incremental revenue and earnings growth.  Our balanced approach to cost management allows us to reinvest in our customers while delivering high margins with low capital intensity. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow and return value to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Our portfolio simplification has created over $20 billion of shareholder value, allowing us to intensely focus on growing the core.  As a purpose-driven Company, we're enabling economic opportunity for all, while supporting our people, our communities, and our planet. I would like to once more take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their tremendous work at the last quarter and for their support for our buyers and sellers in the eBay community. We will now take your questions. Operator. Thank you, Jamie. And thank you, Tom, for your question. It's good to meet you this afternoon. I suppose, I [Indiscernible] in two areas, I've [Indiscernible] from two Companies, which were leaders in an industry around customer-centricity and innovation.  And coming over to eBay a Company that's got a real sense of purpose. An amazing team and our hearts around customer-centricity and innovation were some of the core facets that I looked at when I came out to eBay. Since I've been here, it's really clear about the sheer size and scale of the enterprise and what opportunities are ahead of us in terms of its growth.  We really do have incredible durability of the financial model with a fortress balance sheet, best-in-class margins, incredible free cash flow. And even after a few weeks, I feel that the value of the enterprise is really misunderstood because of the potential that's ahead of us and the strategy that Jamie's laid out. So, I'm really excited to be here. I think there are huge opportunities for the enterprise and I'm looking for to my journey over here and eBay hey, we got Steve here. [Indiscernible] So I'll start off with -- the second quarter. And as it relates to everything else on an Apples -- Apple basis, we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all of the major metrics. We laid out our Q3 - third-quarter guidance, and obviously, that reflects the best view based on what we're seeing in our most recent trends in the first part of the quarter. And our latest outlook on my ability.  And this is actually an unchanged view versus what we communicated when me [Indiscernible] in the second quarter and what we indicated was that we expected the second half GMV growth will be similar to Q2 as the Asia comps will be offset by lower macro benefits in 2021 as some mobility got back to normal and we are seeing some of that, in particular, a couple of our key markets in the lights of Germany and the U.K. That underpins that.  And again, we still to -- when we look through that lens, we expect that to lead to a mid, low-to-mid teen volume declines year-over-year, which actually at the heart of it indicates modestly positive growth from the underlying business on the basis of us continuing to improve the customer experience and execute on the vision that Jamie has a light out. Specifically, with regards to your second question about the 33% operating margin for 2021, obviously, we're ramping payments up.  We talked extensively about the fact that that's actually a lower margin part of the businesses sort of 25%, we've guided our expectations that 2021 will end with that 33%. With our recast financials ties a 150 basis stronger than 2019. So, we're right on track with the margin accretion from all of the initiatives that we're driving forward. We're not guiding 2022 at this point, but I'm very pleased with the trajectory that we're sitting on. Hi Richard, good to meet you remotely. I'll turn off the first question with regards to margins. So, I think about the 3 key areas that the underlying business, there are payments, and then there are the lights of authentication. And so, as a reminder, we laid out the strategy around payments a couple of years ago.  With regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue, $500 million of incremental [Indiscernible] margin, and as Jamie alluded to, that is going very well, the momentum's going well, we've increased the full cost for 2021 to 1.8, [Indiscernible] on the revenue side. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to be on the path for the incremental 150 basis points over two years on our margin story. So, it's not necessarily driving any dilution in the margin story.  It's great from a Net Income standpoint as we go forward. The second point on authentication, Jamie mentioned the return on investment that is providing, it rather de minimus when you look at the overall cost structure in terms of, in fact, less than the half of points of margin is where you go from authentication, but the amounts of stickiness that are providing for our customers when they are going to cost cross-category buying more than pays for itself, and it's an investment that we're really glad we're making as we think about the whole ecosystem and And then the ability for that to move [Indiscernible] -- across categories.  With regard to our free cash flow at an underlying level which generated a free cash flow of $910 million in the quarter. The warrants are not achieved yet, and the free cash flow's investments. What I would say is that we continue to invest in the product as part of our core platform. In terms of the payment's rollout, which is going extremely well, and other product investments with regards to moving this side forward in the categories that Jamie alluded to earlier. So, we're doing very well in terms of the organization and how we're moving forward, and very happy to follow offline if there are any further questions. Good afternoon, Deepak. So, I'll address the first question as you laid an eye in terms of my ability, we have, as I said in my prepared comments, assume that we start to ramp off the significant lockdowns coming from 2020 through '21.  We talked about the fact that mobility, in terms of people getting out and about would increase as we went through the second quarter. And so, as we got into the third, then that's rolling off. In fact, just -- if you look at, particularly, Germany, one of our biggest markets in the U.K., things are pretty much back to normal from my ability standpoint, travels going through the roof. If you look at Search, in terms of leisure activities in travel I think that's as it is going forward.  Obviously, it feels a little different, maybe over here at the moment with regards to the Delta variant, but in that sense, we are missing things where we're expecting that going forward, I'm not going to get beyond quarter 3 Deepak you know because we chose not to guide further than that because of the uncertainty.  But we are [Indiscernible] in the third quarter that things are starting to get back to some normality. And -- and we're not in the lockdown scenario. With regards to the Adevinta transaction, obviously, that was completed. When we think about Adyen and Korea, whilst we have a great [Indiscernible] transactions and not closed yet.  And obviously, therefore we're not getting into any discussions about the proceeds of [Indiscernible] those transactions until those are closed. So obviously leading into the [Indiscernible] venture Very pleased that we were able to increase the share buyback from 2 billion to 5 billion this year in terms of driving those returns to shareholders. But it's too early to say with regard to the other transactions that have not closed yet."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today I'll begin the call with key highlights from the second quarter. Then I will share some updates on the progress towards our strategic vision. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, our new CFO, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The second quarter of 2021 marked several important milestones in the ongoing transformation of eBay. I want to thank our team for making it happen.  We've accelerated our pace of innovation while executing several complex transactions. Their dedication and focus have created tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. Let me start with a few of our portfolio enhancements. We completed the transition of eBay's classified business to Adevinta. This deal was originally valued at approximately $9.2 billion, but closing in June had appreciated to 13.3 billion.  Shortly after closing, we announced the deal with [Indiscernible] to sell approximately 135 million of our [Indiscernible] shares for over $2.4 billion. This agreement fulfills regulatory commitments while returning value to eBay shareholders. We also increased our share buyback plan for the year from $2 billion to $5 billion. In June, we announced the sale of over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion, bringing together two meeting e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock significant potential in Korea.  We anticipate the deal will close either later this year or in early 2022. These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward. When I spoke to you last July, I outlined a renewed vision and strategic plan for the Company. We set out on a multi-year journey to become the best global marketplace for sellers and buyers through a tech lead reimagination. Our priorities were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers, and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers by turning them into enthusiasts. To date, our progress is very encouraging, our underlying growth is positive, and the strategy is working.  Q2 results were strong and all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations. Revenue grew 11% driven by an acceleration in the payments' migration and advertising growth. We funded incremental investments in product development while delivering $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS above the high end of our range. As expected, GMV declined 11% compared to last year when results were heavily impacted by the initial pandemic lockdown. Importantly, compared to prepare endemic levels two years ago, we're seeing positive underlying GMV growth. Our customer metrics remain healthy on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 5% to 19 million globally.  As more small businesses and consumers continue to turn to eBay's global platform to reach millions of potential customers from around the world. This quarter, global active buyers totaled 159 million, down 2% versus last year, and up 3% versus 2019. We have been focused on building lifelong trusted relationships with enthusiast buyers. Changes in our marketing mix and product investments have been focused on attracting and retaining these enthusiasts, particularly, Gen Z and millennials. In parallel, we have discontinued legacy tactics that led to low-value infrequent or one-and-done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy.  These high-value buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher-quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term. Moving on from buyer trends, the payments and advertising initiatives continue to deliver a simpler product experience, and meaningful benefits for sellers, buyers, and shareholders. Managed payments are now live in every market globally, and the transition is progressing faster than expected. During the second quarter, we processed 71% of on-platform volume through managed payments.  We exited Q2 at a run rate of over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter. Managing the payments experience ourselves enabled us to eliminate a pain point that seller occasionally faced on eBay, unpaid items. Changes to checkout have been made to address this issue, and today, 99% of fixed-price transactions are paid upfront. We have also started to address this issue for best offers and auctions by asking buyers to provide a payment method in order to bid. This is a significant win for sellers as it frees up inventory and reduces their post-transaction costs. Our advertising business continues to perform well.  In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by [Indiscernible] listings, which delivered almost $224 million up 8%, more than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements that increase conversion. We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing promoted listings offerings and from new product innovations. Following a number of successful trials in Q2, we are scaling several new products globally over the next few months.  Previously, sellers could only promote fixed-priced listings, but now they can increase visibility for a flat fee on auctions to increase conversion. In June, we also introduced a Cost per Click ad product to sellers in our major markets. Initial results from the first 100,000 listings showed that sellers' return on ad spends with higher than industry benchmarks. We're placing more AI-powered recommendations for pricing and keyword bidding into the Seller Hub to help sellers drive predictable volume. Finally, we are beginning to syndicate ads off eBay's platform to drive more buyers to listings.  Importantly, sellers maintain control of pricing invisibility while benefiting from the scaled marketing capabilities of eBay. In addition to advertising and payments, we are driving a number of other site-wide initiatives. For consumer sellers, we're simplifying the selling process with a heavy focus on mobile. This includes easier label printing solutions in the app and faster listing through image or barcode scans. In trading cards, where we first launched image-based listing, sellers [Indiscernible] are able to match scans over 80% of the time. The time it takes to create a listing has been dramatically reduced and we plan to expand the capability to more product categories later this year. For Small Business sellers, we continue to expand and optimize their eBay toolkit. To help drive repeat businesses from enthusiasts to eBay stores, we built a CRM tool that enables sellers to fund and distribute their own coupons. Since launching a few months ago, over 1 million buyers have purchased items through these targeted campaigns. As you've heard me say in the past, we are focused on a number of categories where we are well-positioned to serve both sellers and buyers. These categories are growing significantly faster than the overall business, and I'm delighted with the progress our team is making.  Our innovation playbook has included increasing customer satisfaction, improving trust, growing supply, and marketing to enthusiasts. As we exited Q2, we have applied this playbook to approximately 10% of our volume across our top 3 markets. With our current plan and ongoing momentum, we expect to expand coverage to approximately 20% by the end of the year. One of these categories is trading cards. In North America, we continue to see substantial growth with approximately $2 billion of GMV in the first half of the year, equal to all of 2020.  Despite these strong results, we see additional untapped potential in the market that we plan to capture with further innovation. We recently launched a price guide and collection tools aimed at trading card enthusiasts. These new features leverage unparalleled inventory and pricing data, allowing customers to view, manage, and track the value of their collections in real-time. As a leader in trading cards with 25 years of transactional data, no one is better positioned to estimate the value of every card ever sold.  In addition, the collection tool seamlessly tracks all eBay activity and offline inventory in one place. This makes it easy for enthusiasts to assess opportunities, quickly trade, and increase the value of their collections. Sneakers and watches continue to outgrow our overall marketplace. Since launching one year ago, we have authenticated nearly 1 million items, enabling a game-changing level of trust. Both categories are seeing close to 90% customer satisfaction rates on authenticated transactions. Our sneakers business saw strong double-digit growth, despite tougher comps from a year ago.  And based on the success, we have expanded sneaker authentication to the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Luxury watches are also sustaining double-digit growth, improved by our trust is leading to strong cross-category shopping behavior similar to what we have seen in sneakers. In fact, luxury watch buyers spend $8,000 on more than 50 items in other categories, well above the average eBay buyer. The next luxury category we were focused on is handbags. We plan to leverage a similar playbook from watches and sneakers to deliver a higher NPS for buyers and sellers.  We have started in the U.S., by authenticating handbags over $500 from major brands. Refurbished electronics continues to be another area of growth across our largest markets. Our certified refurbished experience is strengthening relationships with best-in-class brands by opening new sales channels. We recently welcomed Samsung Galaxy to the program, providing eBay buyers access to exclusive like new products, at exceptional prices. Vehicles, parts, and accessories have historically been one of the strongest performing categories on eBay and remain so today.  Our platform offers a wide inventory selection supported by a robust catalog. The fitment shopping experience matches car parts to vehicles to help buyers shop efficiently and confidently. In Q2, we expanded this capability by enabling a motorcycle parts finder in Germany and the U.K. We also expanded my garage feature, which allows buyers to store their vehicle data, leading to a more tailored shopping experience in Canada, Italy, France, and Spain. We plan to launch more technology-driven innovations in this category later this year to further build on our success.  Taking a step back, eBay exists to create economic opportunity for all, that purpose guides our approach to our customers, our communities, and our team at eBay. This year, our leadership team's individual goals focused on accelerating meaningful change in diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout every level of our Company. We formed an ESG Council composed of senior leaders across the Company whose role is to guide and ensure the success of sustainability initiatives. During the quarter, we published our 5th annual impact report and 3rd annual diversity, equity, and inclusion report, detailing the progress we made in the past year, as well as outlining our 2025 goals.  The full list of activities is extensive, but I would like to share a few highlights. We made progress on our journey to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. Our communities of inclusion have conducted 150 events with more than 10,000 attendees in the past year. We have also continued multi-year efforts to ensure gender pay equity, resulting in 100% pay parity in the U.S. and 99.7% globally. Another priority is managing our environmental impact. Investing in clean energy is a focus for the Company and our goal is to source 100% renewable energy by 2025, we have already reached 74% of our goal through a combination of power purchase agreements and local programs.  Just last week, we announced that we are teaming up with McDonald's in an agreement with light source BP to purchase power from Louisiana's largest solar project. The electricity produced will be greater than the power used at our largest data center. Finally, I would like to call up the incredible generosity of our buyers and sellers. During Q2, customers contributed over $35 million to their favorite course through eBay for charity. This represented a 16% growth versus last year. And the platform is on track to hit the 2025 goal of raising $600 million. These are just a sample of the ongoing ESG related activities and I encourage you to check out more at eBay Inc.com.  Q2 was another step forward in the multi-year transformation of eBay. The business delivered strong results, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Customers are delighted with the innovation in our focus categories, leading to volume growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. We are harnessing the power of next-gen technology to make eBay the seller platform of choice, and to attract lifelong enthusiasts. Our payments transition is nearly complete, delivering benefits to sellers, buyers, and shareholders.  Our advertising product portfolio is expanding, giving sellers more tools to grow their business. And we simplified our portfolio, enabling us to focus on the core while creating significant Shareholder value. Our team continues to be relentlessly focused on executing for our customers. I'm delighted to welcome four new exceptional leaders to our executive team this year. In addition, we have hired critical talent in areas such as technology, AI, analytics, and category management.  The teams in place are well-positioned to propel this business forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Before I do, I want to say how excited I am to have another world-class customer-centric leader on our team to help us realize our vision. Steve, over to you. Yes. So first on the buyer strategy, this is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech lead reimagination as being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in 2019, where it was really just about the number of active buyers, even low-value buyers, or one and done buyers.  I've got the whole organization pivoted to focusing on those high-value buyers, buyers that are buying over $800, buying 6 times a year, or buyers who sell, and so as you think about these buyers, they are so strong at EBITDA. 20% of them, they make up 75% of GMV. and the goal is, how do we turn more buyers into these lifelong enthusiasts? I've met a lot of these buyers, they wake up and they get a cup of coffee, and they turn to eBay and open the eBay app.  And our focus is really not on just the total number, but really focused on how are we driving these buyers to become enthusiasts? The metrics that we show in the Board deck, are [Indiscernible] 12-month metric. So, we're obviously lapping the buyers that we acquired in Q2. But going forward, our focus will really be on these long-term enthusiasts.  So, I'm excited to say that their GMV is growing. They're growing as a population, and more and more, you're going to see us doing things to drive that longevity because we know the things that move buyers up the cohort curve into long-term buyers. On your second question on the portfolio, absolutely. A huge part of the portfolio simplification is about being able to focus on the marketplace, and as Steve talked about, we generated $20 billion in value for shareholders starting with the StubHub transaction. But I think more importantly now, it enables us to focus all of our attention on the Marketplace business. As I've talked about, we see a lot of growth opportunities in that business. The strategy that we have is working. We're in year one of a multi-year re-imagination of eBay.  But if you look at what we talked about a second ago with the 10% now about to reach 20% of categories. It's really working. Customer satisfaction is at 90, it's leading to a very strong GMV. And we see the same potential for this innovation playbook in every category on the site. And Steve, maybe you want to take the last one. Thanks for the question. On the first one we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%, that it opens up even more opportunities for us from a, how do we service our buyers and sellers? So, some examples of things that we've already launched, for example, is we launched a partnership with After pay as an additional form of payment in Australia, allowing people in that market to pay with installments.  It's very strong in Australia, and that's certainly helped us in Australia business. In our U.K. business, we've launched a partnership that allows us to do seller financing and help sellers out there. And we'll continue to expand in different ways throughout the globe on more opportunities around managed payments.  The other big one that I talked about earlier is that now that commerce and payments are one, and we can manage all of that on eBay, there's a lot of friction we can take out of the platform, so unpaid items are a great example where for 25 years since I was here the first time, sellers have had to face items where buyers wouldn't pay. We've now eliminated that in the 99% of options on our way to do that in best price -- I'm sorry, the best offer in auctions. We've eliminated fixed price on our way to do it, is the best offer in auctions.  And two weeks ago, we had eBay open with thousands of sellers online and we announced this. And it was massive rejoicing from them because this has been a key pain point. So, the other thing I'm excited about is just eliminating those pain points. On your question on the fulfillment service, what we saw in the U.S. and especially in our cross-border trade, coming out of Greater China, for example, is the ability to forward-deployed inventory is a benefit because of the predictability that it gives to buyers from that standpoint.  We're using it to help scale small businesses, to drive the ability to have for deployment. And basically, pass those savings onto the customer. So, we're just getting started with that program, but we've learned a lot about cross-border trade and, and we're excited that fulfillment services are going to help scale some of our small businesses and in their cross-border inventory. Yes. So, on the first one on Promoted Listings, no, that business is doing well, we frew it 8% in the quarter, despite the volume being down 11. And we actually are starting to scale up a couple of pilots that we launched in Q2. Specifically, ads for auctions, what we're calling Promoted Listings Express, which is a CBC business.  And then -- and off eBay advertising business. So, we continue to see lots of potential in that business, and these 3 areas are just getting started. On the sold items, that's really a reflection of the purposeful decisions that we've made, to one is moving away from low-value items that weren't driving the type of return and low-value buyers specifically, as well as a shift to higher ASP in general because of the strategy to focus categories strategy working.  So, we talked about the strength that we're seeing in trading cards and collectibles. Already having done $2 billion this year, the same as all of last year. Really driving our C2C business, and C2C tends to have a higher ASP. Our higher average selling price than our B2C business. And so that's also driving kind of that dynamic. so, it's actually in line with what -- with where we wanted to be, we think it's healthy for the ecosystem, and we think it's going to continue to be driven that way because C2C, as we look at it, we hope to continue to outpace B2C and lean in on these categories of value, like our luxury goods collectibles, et cetera. Yeah. So, on your first question on the buyer strategy. Yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers who are kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyer. If you remember back in 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-month metrics, some of those numbers are actually still in our numbers even from 2019. But the reason I'm focused on is if you look at that 50% of buyers, they only contribute 5% of GMV. And the top 20% contribute 75%.  And so, by focusing the organization not on just how many buyers do we have on the platform, but how many of our buyers are we turning into these high-value buyers? We think that's much healthier for the growth of the platform in the long term, much healthier for sellers, et cetera.  Jive's better with the marketing strategies that we're going after while we're really focused on the first 90 days of a customer and getting them up to their lifecycle. So, this is going to be a purposeful strategy you are going to see us on for years, walking away from the work that we did back in 2019, what when you ask about the managed payments, what I'm really happy about is the execution from the team. If you look at when we started, for example, enabling greater China, we got to 90% penetration within 10 weeks.  And so, we took the learnings from what started two years ago with the U.S. and Germany, and we've learned a lot as we've rolled out all of the other countries. And that pace speaks to the -- the pace of execution of the team and what they're doing and another, a lot of questions of what we'd be able to even reach the targets we had for next year originally. And I'm just excited that we're ahead of schedule and we're starting to do things like the After pay and the seller financing because there's just a lot of potential for this business as we fully manage the payments by -- all through eBay. Yes. So first on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited at how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication too, for sneakers to U.K., Australia, and Canada. This quarter we announced that we're authenticating handbags over $500 in the U.S. And we're using a mixture of third-party and in-house resources to do so.  But what we're seeing is that this authentication has a great ROI. What it's able to do in terms of driving GMV, driving new buyers into the site. I will just give you -- I'll reiterate the stat we talked about last quarter in sneakers, which is acquiring a Gen Z, they buy $500 in sneakers, but they buy $2,000 in other categories on the site. We're seeing the same thing in watches, where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches, and that's over 50 items.  And that's one of the benefits of eBay, is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate. On eBay stores, we talked about being the seller platform of choice and a big part of that is our strategy of really growing eBay stores. This quarter we announced a new program where it's much simpler to set up your eBay store. And I'm really excited by one of the features the team now -- announced, which was the ability for a seller to send coupons to repeat buyers. So, this is something that sellers have been asking for.  We built it in as part of the store's platform. And in just a few short months since launch, that product already has 1 million buyers taking advantage of those coupons from sellers. So, another thing that -- as we had our big eBay open event 2 weeks ago, our sellers were really excited. And frankly, we're just getting started on that program. so, we're even continuing to make sellers aware of these new capabilities. So, you'll continue to see quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year innovation on eBay Stores because it's an important part of our strategy. On your first question, I think is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments. And now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of sellers will actually be paying lower fees when you look at the combined take rate that they pay, because they're no longer paying that separate piece, and it's one single rate. The reason you are still seeing a rise in intake rate and may continue to do so is just because of the ramp of payments. So as payments ramp up, that starts to get reflected in eBay's take rate.  But the seller is no longer paying that PayPal or other forms of payment take rate. The second key -- the second key thing for us is making sure that we return the value to the sellers for the fees that we're charging. And so, when you think about the scaling demand that we can bring in terms of 159 million buyers, in terms of new capabilities that we're bringing to them on the platform, like the ability to go back to repeat sellers. There are areas where we've discounted our fees like sneakers, which has worked out really well in terms of growing those categories.  We look in general at the value that we provide. And I would say in our core business, we actually feel really good about that. And what we're seeing in our advertising business is that the ROEs of the return on ad spend that our sellers are seeing, are actually higher than what they're getting on other platforms. Which also, I think speaks to the value of the demand that we're providing. I'll let Steve take the other questions. Okay. Operator, I think we'll take one more, please. Yes. So first on the Promoted Listings, yeah, the rollout of CBC is really to have additional ad formats and additional capabilities, for sellers to drive visibility of their listings. So, we talked last quarter about how we're only at 1% of GMV. And if you look at other platforms, we think there's significant potential in the kind of low-to-mid single-digit percentage of GMV. The backs of the existing program, where we've already done over a billion dollars, grew 8% this quarter. We're really on a single type of advertising in a single format. So, it was all CPA on fixed price.  So, as we expand now to auctions as we expand to a CPC where we introduce more bidding capabilities for our top spot and search, which just enables sellers to have more tools. So, we're in beta on that product right now, and I would just say in general, we're really excited by what we're seeing because our ROEs are really strong, meaning our buyer experience is performing well, and the return that the sellers are getting on that spend is productive and much more productive than they would get on other platforms. In terms of eBay Open, I think we had a lot of really positive feedback about the unpaid item noise.  I've known sellers forever get frustrated when that happens to them, especially for a new seller. and so, they're really excited that we're tackling that as part of managed payments. I'd say they're really excited by what we're doing in stores and coupons because they want to build their brand on eBay. They want to drive repeat business.  And so, I think they're really excited by that. I'd say the other form that was really well attended and -- and had a lot of excitement was the trading cards forum. The launch of computer vision, where we're driving 80% of the scans is really identifying what the product is and it's simplifying the listing flow. We launched this new my collections, which is a really popular feature for people because they can show up their collections. And we launched a price guide feature which -- eBay has this treasure trove of data in the 25 years of history, nobody has the data that we have. It's a really great asset for us.  So, I'd say that area and those sellers that joined in particular, we're really excited by the innovation that we're making. I love those forums because this platform gets better by listening to our sellers and hearing their feedback. And they give us lots of ideas of things to continue to work on in the tech lead reimagination. So, a great interaction, despite being virtual, they all can't wait to be in person again, like we can, but it was a really good session."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Joe Billante, VP of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.\nJoe Billante: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the first quarter of 2021. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cring, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Andy's commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie's and Andy's remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise. In this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of April 28, 2021, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll begin the call with key highlights from the first quarter. Then, I will share some reflections from my first 12 months as CEO and provide an update on the status of our tech-led re-imagination. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The first quarter of 2021 was an excellent start to the year for sellers and buyers on eBay. Gross merchandise volume grew 24%, ahead of expectations. Revenue grew 38% outpacing volume, primarily due to payments and advertising. This is the fastest our revenues have grown since 2005, and we lean [ph] further into technology and vertical marketing investments, but still delivered $1.09 in non-GAAP earnings per share above our expectation. Importantly, our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 8% to 20 million globally, more small businesses are joining the platform and more consumers are engaging and selling. C2C GMV growth outpaced B2C for the fourth quarter in a row. This is positive for the long term as consumer sellers bring unique inventory at compelling prices and spend more than twice as much as buyers, who don't sell. Active buyers grew 7% to 187 million globally. We are retaining buyers acquired over the last year at similar rates as pre-pandemic level, and we're seeing higher customer satisfaction in several categories as well as increased spend per buyer. We have continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives payments and advertising, which contribute to a seamless customer experience, increase our platform monetization and deliver compelling financial results. Managed payments ended Q1 with over four million sellers migrated. This includes millions of consumer sellers and hundreds of thousands of businesses globally. During the quarter, eBay managed payments representing over 52% of on-platform volume, up from 38% last quarter. In the US, we exited the quarter over 80% complete. By applying what we learned in previous markets, rollouts in France, Italy, and Spain progressed at an even faster pace, and we're on track to launch Greater China this quarter and all remaining markets by the middle of the year. We continue to see higher seller satisfaction due to a simpler end-to-end experience that reduces cost and complexity. For many years before managed payments, sellers had to manage delays between purchase and payment across two platforms that tied up their inventory. As sellers migrate to managed payments, that pain point has resolved saving time and money. And in Q1, we reduced unpaid items by approximately 80% on fixed-price transaction. We remain on track to complete the vast majority of the payments transition by the end of this year, which will deliver our stated financial goals at the least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in annualized operating income in 2022. In Q1, advertising growth outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings which delivered close to $224 million of revenue, up 58%. More than 1.3 million sellers promoted close to 400 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by increased seller adoption and AI improvements that increased conversion. Inspired by the success of Promoted Listings over the past few years, we are investing aggressively in innovation. We reached $1 billion of advertising revenue in 2020, primarily through Promoted Listings which leverages a risk free CPA model for fixed price inventory. To capture our next billion, we are running multiple experiments, including an ad product for auctions and cost per click capabilities. We are also exploring a new capability that expands seller exposure by increasing off-eBay traffic to promoted listings. Q1 clearly demonstrates that the ongoing execution of our long-term vision is driving better results. Small business and consumer sellers are thriving, and buyers are finding unique items at great prices. We have seen strong growth in volume, revenue, and earnings over the past year due to a combination of mobility driven tailwinds and the execution of our multiyear monetization initiatives. And we are driving value through portfolio optimization and returning capital to shareholders. Despite these notable achievements, there's still a tremendous amount of potential to be realized. Now, I'd like to take a step back to a year ago when I rejoined this remarkable company as CEO. I knew eBay as a pioneer in e-commerce with a globally recognized brand, robust organic traffic, and long-standing customer relationships. And I've always been inspired by the purpose and special culture it creates. Last July, we set out a vision for a tech-led reimagination of eBay. First, we believe that we can drive growth in our core by significantly increasing customer satisfaction. Second, we saw the need to better serve our small businesses and consumer sellers to become their platform of choice. And third, we identified the opportunity to evolve our relationship with buyers to drive better, long-term retention. I am confident we can deliver on these three pillars positioning us to more effectively compete and win in a huge and growing addressable market. Our results to date are very encouraging. Our underlying growth is accelerating, sellers and buyers are growing, and we are making progress in our pursuit to be the best global marketplace to buy and sell. Simply put, our strategy is working. Let me share some examples with you. In the US we are growing our core. In Q1, sneakers valued above $100 grew at a triple-digit rate once again. Since launching authentication, we verified hundreds of thousands of sneakers, and we're seeing buyer satisfaction above 80 as a result. In addition, we are expanding our engagement with Gen Z and Millennials through a wide range of social channels. Based on the tremendous success we've seen in the US, we are rapidly expanding identical capabilities to other major markets. We have set up local authentication centers and are launching in the UK, Australia, and Canada this quarter. These centers will also unlock cross-border trade opportunities in sneakers and in other categories.  In luxury watches, we saw growth accelerate from 16% in Q4 to 38% in Q1 in the US. For authenticated items, we are seeing customer satisfaction that was close to 90% and is changing customer behavior. Sellers are listing more items and seeing a higher price realization. Buyers are visiting eBay more often and spending more. One of the key advantages of our platform is cross-category shopping. Our luxury watch buyers like our sneakers enthusiasts spend thousands of dollars on other categories across the platform. In addition, based on the value we are delivering in luxury watches, we recently raised fees in this category to create more investment capacity. For our certified refurbished experience, eBay sellers continue to see strong velocity and we've expanded in the US to over 150 brands. We've also rolled certified refurbished out to the UK, Canada, and Germany with more than 100 top brands signed up already. Buyers love the low prices on like-new products as well as free shipping, extended warranties, and extended returns. Now I want to highlight the next core category where we see significant potential, trading cards, a key part of our collectibles business. eBay is a market leader in this category with the widest selection across all price levels. We've seen explosive growth to start the year. In the US, GMV was over $1 billion in Q1, which represents more than half of 2020's record setting volume. Active buyers of trading cards doubled and existing buyers purchased more items at higher prices than last year. To dramatically simplify selling, we've recently launched image-based scanning for our top selling trading cards. In addition, we introduced a new low cost track and shipping service and aggressively market it to buyers on social and enthusiast forums. We plan to launch more innovation for trading cards throughout this year. Another area of focus for us is customization. Beginning next month in the UK and Germany, we will offer a new capability to all sellers to offer personalized goods in categories, such as home, fashion and jewelry. This will allow buyers to find and enter specific customization requests to the seller. In the past, this process was manual, which limited GMV. But we believe this new experience can significantly improve customer satisfaction, bring more supply onto the platform, and capture more growth. We plan to expand this capability to all major markets in the coming months. As I mentioned upfront, our playbook to grow the core is working. We have a series of innovations rolling out to more markets throughout the year. While we've only touched a small percentage of global volume so far, all of our largest eBay categories collectibles, home and garden, fashion, electronics, and parts and accessories have addressable opportunities that can benefit from this playbook. In addition to category-specific changes, we are rolling out site-wide improvements for all sellers. For consumer, sellers and small businesses we are focused on significantly reducing complexity, helping maximize value and driving sustainable growth. We believe these changes will increase seller satisfaction and grow the number of active sellers on the platform. Here are some examples of what we are doing. Image-based listing can remove up to 75% of the time it takes to list an item. We have activated this feature in trading cards, and we plan to expand to multiple categories and geographies throughout the year. Last quarter we talked about how we have migrated almost all of our store subscribers to our new platform that increases traffic to their items by approximately 20%. This quarter we empowered sellers with new CRM features, allowing them to directly issue coupons to acquire buyers. In addition, they can set coupon budgets, include QR codes on packing slips, and drive repeat business to their eBay stores. Recently we opened up Terapeak product research free for all Seller Hub users in several markets, including price insights and listing quality reports. In addition, we launched sourcing insights that help sellers analyze trending categories, top products and signals what inventory is most likely to sell. To acquire more buyers, we are also adding new ad formats to our display and social marketing, including video and we improved the inventory feeds that power them. Once we acquire these buyers, we are making changes to increase engagement and trust in their first 90 days and beyond. As an example, we are leveraging a mobile-first approach and revamping key communications buyers received. We are seeing increased engagement from Gen Z and millennial customers through social shopping, such as eBay Sneaker Showdown. For our experienced buyers, we continue to optimize the end-to-end shopping experience. In Q1, we increased conversion by improving our search engine's understanding of longer complex queries, and we added functionality to help buyers identify free local pickup items in their community. We are excited that all three of our strategic pillars are producing volume, seller and buyer growth, but we have a long runway ahead of us. We will continue to drive our investment decisions both organic and inorganic in pursuit of achieving this vision. While I'm pleased with our business results, I am more proud of the way our employees and our platform are fulfilling our purpose of providing economic opportunity for all. As part of our commitment to empowering small businesses everywhere, we announced an investment of $25 million into the Clear Vision Impact Fund to help support small and medium-sized minority-owned businesses that support historically underserved communities. We continue to support the UK's National Health Care Service efforts and I'm happy to report that we're now up to 2 billion PPE items distributed utilizing eBay's technology. Additionally, we remain active in philanthropy during Q1. We raised over $35 million through eBay for charity. The company also contributed to Asian Americans Advanced Justice and supported employee giving during Black History Month and the Lunar New Year and we quadrupled employee matching gift limits through the eBay Foundation. Finally, another area that inspires me is eBay's impact on the planet. Many companies make admirable investments into adjacent programs, but at eBay sustainability is the core of our business. Since eBay was founded over 25 years ago, re-commerce or the resale of pre-owned goods has been an integral part of our platform and purpose. Our community connects and trades pre-owned items that hold meaning and usefulness and keeps these items out of landfills. A recent survey confirmed that re-commerce resonates with our customers. In the US, 87% of respondents say they have sold pre-owned goods in the last 12 months. And they aren't just selling 81% of Gen V customers surveyed said that buying pre-owned items has become more common in the last year. In summary, we are making great progress on the tech library imagination of eBay. We delivered historically strong Q1 results, putting us in a stronger position today than we thought we'd be coming into the year. Looking forward, we are excited because our long-term strategy is working. By increasing customer satisfaction, we are accelerating our core business while attracting and retaining sellers and buyers. There is more work to do, but I couldn't be prouder of the eBay team. They are focused and driven and they work hard every day to innovate, keeping our customers at the forefront. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?\nAndy Cring: Thanks Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our first quarter financial highlights starting on slide four of the earnings presentation. The first quarter was another great quarter for eBay. We generated over $27 billion of GMV, our highest GMV quarter ever. We delivered $3 billion of revenue, $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS, and $855 million of free cash flow, while returning $414 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on slide 5. We exited the quarter with 187 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth consistent with the fourth quarter. We've added 13 million buyers to the ecosystem since the beginning of 2020 and are experiencing retention rates that remain in line with historical trends. And as we said throughout 2020, we continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts. Moving to slide 6. In Q1, we enabled $27.5 billion of marketplace GMV, up 24% accelerating six points versus the fourth quarter. On a spot basis this represents growth of 29%, an acceleration of eight points versus the fourth quarter. As over 60% of our GMV is generated outside of the US, we saw a five-point translation benefit due to the weaker dollar. On platform volume, which represents nearly 85% of total GMV grew at 28% a seven-point acceleration versus Q4, driven by site-wide product experience improvements, progress we're making in key categories, increased mobility restrictions and additional stimulus in the US. Our platform business in Korea was relatively stable versus the fourth quarter at 4% year-on-year growth. In the US, we generated $10.4 billion of GMV in Q1, up 36% year-on-year accelerating 11 points from the fourth quarter, driven by mobility dynamics, stimulus payments and strength in our core categories including collectibles. International GMV was up 17% year-on-year, a two-point acceleration versus the fourth quarter, driven by strength in our core categories and mobility dynamics. Turning to revenue on slide 7, our Q1 net revenue was $3 billion, up 38% and accelerating 10 points on an FX-neutral basis. As Jamie said this was our strongest quarter since 2005. On a spot basis this represents growth of 42%. We delivered $2.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 40%, accelerating nine points from the fourth quarter mostly driven by our payments migration and volume strength. In managed payments, we continue to execute and have made great progress on seller migration to the new payments platform. As Jamie mentioned, we process over half of our global on-platform volume in the quarter, which contributed approximately 15 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2020. Transaction take rate was 10% for the quarter accelerating 20 basis points driven by managed payments, partially offset by category and seller mix in addition to currency hedging impacts. When we started the managed payments journey, we expect it to progressively increase monetization of our site, while delivering better seller economics and improved experience for both buyers and sellers and overall revenue growth for the business. We continue to deliver across all of these dimensions. We delivered $291 million of marketing services and other revenue up 22%, accelerating 19 points from the fourth quarter, driven by first-party growth in Korea which grew approximately 120% in addition to strength in advertising and shipping. Turning to slide eight and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. This is up approximately 140 basis points year-on-year driven by volume and advertising, partially offset by product and marketing reinvestments, the impact of managed payments growth, and FX. For each of the non-GAAP expense buckets, volume and a higher take rate provided leverage as a percent of revenue. I will provide additional context for other significant drivers. Cost of revenue was up nearly four points year-over-year as leverage was more than offset by scaling managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea. As a reminder, the managed payments cost structure includes payment processing costs that scale in line with payments revenue. This dynamic has been fully contemplated in our 2022 margin targets. Sales and marketing expense was down nearly two points versus the prior year as leverage was partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy, strategic reinvestments in online marketing, and FX. Product development costs were down 10 basis points as leverage was mostly offset by investments in end-to-end product experience in addition to managed payments and advertising. G&A was down nearly two points primarily from leverage and a disciplined cost control. Transaction losses were down approximately one and a half points from the benefit of fee netting in our managed payments initiative and lapping COVID-driven deferred fees and seller protection increases. Turning to EPS on slide nine, in Q1, we delivered $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS up 59% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, growth in payments and advertising, and the reduction in share count driven by our repurchases, partially offset by investments in product and marketing. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82 up 44% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by the fair value of the Adyen warrant. Moving to slide 10, in Q1, we had a very strong quarter of cash generation, finishing Q1 with $855 million of free cash flow, a 65% increase year-on-year driven by topline growth, increased working capital, and lower capital expenditures. Turning to slide 11, for the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $3.9 billion and debt of $7 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $55.70 per share amounting to $292 million. We exited the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Moving to slide 12 and investments, when we announced the classifieds transaction with Adevinta on July 20 of last year, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and the value of Adevinta shares at that time. As of April 27th, the Adevinta share price had appreciated by nearly 37%, which increased the value of the deal to over $12.7 billion. We continue to expect the deal to close in the second quarter with the cash portion of the transaction providing approximately $2 billion net of tax. Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of over $700 million year-on-year. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. We remain excited about both of these investments, the optionality they provide and the significant value each can generate for our shareholders. Turning to guidance on slide 13. For Q2 we are projecting revenue between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion, growing between 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis, representing 12% to 14% growth on a spot basis. This assumes marketplace volume declines high single to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis, representing a decline of mid to high single digits on a spot basis. This volume guidance is driven by three main components. First, the negative impact from lapping our second largest quarter ever, which was fueled by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions. Second, the ongoing benefit from macro factors, including mobility and stimulus payments across our on-platform businesses, which we estimate are contributing high single-digit growth this quarter. Third and most importantly, continued delivery on initiatives driving us towards our vision, many of which Jamie highlighted earlier. On a year-over-two-year basis, this guidance represents growth in the high teens on a spot basis, which is more than $4 billion of incremental GMV versus the same quarter in 2019, as our sellers and buyers have discovered or rediscovered the power and reach of our global platform. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.96 per share, representing a 6% to 11% decrease, primarily driven by volume deleverage and continued investments in product and marketing in support of our strategy, partially offset by managed payments and a lower share count. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in Q2. Finally, on Q2 our EPS guidance assumes approximately $400 million of share buyback. While we aren't providing guidance for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context on our path forward. On volume, our conviction in the vision is increasing and we are confident these efforts will continue to drive additional growth as we scale. While difficult to forecast, mobility will likely continue to improve throughout the second half, pressuring growth. And when combined with easier lapping, that could result in second half FX-neutral volume growth rates similar to those of our second quarter guidance. For buyers, similar to GMV we expect growth will be pressured as we lap periods of high buyer acquisition. We expect revenue growth will continue to materially outpace GMV growth, as our monetization initiatives drive a higher effective take rate. Specifically in payments, we're more than halfway done with the migration of on-platform GMV and expect to deliver at least $1.7 billion of revenue in 2021, well on our way to realizing at least $2 billion of revenue in 2022. On margin we are on target and remain committed to delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We said along the way that margin accretion won't be linear. And in 2021, we expect margin will be approximately 29% for the full year. With regards to cash and capital allocation, we will continue to deliver strong free cash flow. We remain committed to our targets and tenants and we will continue to optimize our capital structure within them. Specifically, on buybacks. For the full year we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of stock excluding deal proceeds. We will update plans for use of proceeds from the classifieds transaction at the time of closure. For our Korea business, we have a strategic review process underway, which includes the possibility of a sale, with interest from multiple parties. We are exploring that interest and we'll provide an update when we have material information to share. And finally, on FX. At current rates, we'd expect the benefit of currency to be smaller in the second half, as we lap a relatively weaker US dollar. In conclusion, Q1 was a record quarter for eBay and we entered Q2 excited about the path forward to deliver on all aspects of our long-term plan. We will continue to execute on our multi-year monetization initiatives, which are driving material benefits to our customers and shareholders, as we move towards at least $2 billion of revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in managed payments and the next $1 billion of advertising revenue. We are delivering on our core strategy, increasing customer satisfaction and attracting and retaining customers as we capitalize on a $0.5 trillion addressable market that is growing double-digits. We're delivering consistent strong free cash flow and continue to deploy that cash in a disciplined manner by investing in our platform for the long-term and returning capital to shareholders. On margins, we remain on target for at least two points of improvement in 2022 compared to 2019, while we continue to drive efficiencies and strategically reinvest to accelerate growth. And finally, we're executing on our portfolio reviews and will deploy capital in a disciplined manner balancing reinvestment in the core, capacity for mergers and acquisitions, paying a dividend and buying back our undervalued stock. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. I have three questions if that's okay. For the guidance, you gave like kind of loss in the year-on-year. But if we look at 1Q to 2Q sequentially, I think, it assumes about a 7% decline Q-on-Q for GMV, normally kind of flat Q-on-Q. So, I guess, can you parse that into how much is like stimulus burning off versus these economies reopening in the context of what Jamie said about buyers retaining at a high level and spend per buyer going up just trying to reconcile that. Second one is on the margins. So, the 29% margin guidance, is that just from all this payment revenue coming in at a lower margin or are there other discrete areas that you're layering in on the investment? And then lastly on the trading cards, are there other categories like this that just kind of have emerged over the last year that you guys maybe had that were nascent and just now are being like activated because consumer behavior has changed? Anything else besides trading cars you would point to that would be an example of coming out of this whole thing why eBay would be in much better shape from a category perspective. Thanks a lot.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. I'll start with the trading card ones and then I'll let Andy talk about the other two. So, yes, we've always had a great history in the Collectibles business and a great history in trading cards. Obviously, Q1 was really strong doing it over $1 billion in the quarter, which was more than half of last year's record setting. And I'd say in general, what we see is that when we take category-by-category, and we changed the NPS, and we changed the customer experience, that changes the buyers and sellers and the GMV follows. And in that case, it's similar to what we saw in sneakers and in watches where that change led to a dramatically different performance. We see customization, which we just launched this quarter as another one of those opportunities. We do millions of items on the site today, but we do it in a way that's really full of a lot of friction between the buyer and the seller, and this makes it really seamless and I think gives us the opportunity to open up more GMV. But as I said upfront, we haven't even touched the -- some of the major categories that we have like home and garden, fashion, electronics, and parts and accessories. These are big core categories that all have addressable opportunities that we think can benefit from this playbook.\nAndy Cring: Yes, Ross. On the other two questions on Q2, and Q1 versus Q2 dynamics. I mean, clearly, the first quarter was a huge quarter for us, as I said, our largest quarter ever. As we indicated in January, we had seen increasing restrictions late last year through most of our markets and those kind of persisted into the first quarter, and the growth in the first quarter driven by two main factors. As we've said, the continued underlying performance and then the correlation between mobility and GMV. And then as the quarter progressed, a lot of further developments and things we learned along the way back to January pace of vaccines were very different from where they are today. Mobility has improved throughout the quarter in most markets. And then you've got as you mentioned the impact of stimulus payments in the US, which it's hard to say exactly the impact, but -- or when it started or when it will stop, but we believe the peak of that impact was probably in the March time frame. So when you look then on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the biggest difference between Q1 and the outlook for Q2 would be the fact that the stimulus -- or not stimulus, sorry, but the mobility is in a better place today than it was at the beginning of the first quarter. Underlying performance continues to be great. And then as we've said, progress on payments is continuing to be very positive as well. That leads a little bit into your second question on margin rate for the year. I think a couple of things to consider. We're still on target for the 30% that we said for next year, and we have said all along, it's not going to be linear. We're going to have quarters where we're up or down, and we're going to continue to balance growth and margin along the way. A couple of things, when you look at Q1 relative to the rest of the year and then the second half -- and again, you hit on a couple. I think it's important to remember, our historical trend is that Q1 is a bit higher than the rest of the year, and typically higher than Q2. Last year, that was a bit muted with the amount of growth that we saw, but I think this year we're -- with the relative size of the two quarters more on that trend. And then without getting into a specific walk on the second half, I think three things. One would be, moderating growth, which will have some impact on volume and deleverage. We continue to invest for long-term health. So we're not going to be managing to a quarterly margin target. We're working towards longer-term business health. And then you did call it, and it's a great problem, which is payments is scaling rapidly. It's delivering a tremendous amount of incremental op income and it does come with a minor bit of pressure on operating margin, but we feel great about that progress and what it does for the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, first off, bigger picture question for you Jamie. You talked a bit about some of the additional product planning with advertising, and so more broadly, I wonder, how you think about the ramp of overall seller monetization, how much additional upside you see there or if you see perhaps an opportunity longer term to shift the model towards more ad orientation like we see with marketplaces in other markets? And then secondly, on the margin side, on the spending side, obviously dynamics this year are a little bit different given the comps. But we've seen periods of reinvestments with eBay over the last decade. And so Jimmy, you outlined a bit of a division last year and it sounds like you're happy with the progress this year so far this year with the verticals. But how do you weigh the need to invest long term and measure your performance on a short-term basis? And how quickly, are you going to be able to pivot if necessary?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So, first on the monetization side. So look obviously both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about -- we feel great about the business in part, because our sellers are seeing a great return on the ad spend. And we think there's a lot of opportunity left from that perspective to help them be able to move their products with velocity. So what we're announcing this quarter is that, we're basically rolling out three new experiments or pilots in our advertising business. The first being placement for our auctions. So the growth that we've seen to date has really just been on the fixed price business. So that will be a new capability. We're also testing a CPC-based capability for our sellers, which is a new potential growth vector. And we're looking at off eBay opportunities for our sellers to even further increase their exposure. So we continue to look at the monetization and are we adding value to sellers? A great example for that is in watches this quarter, we saw an opportunity to increase our fees there, because of the value that we're creating for our sellers in that category. Overall, when I look at advertising, it's still only 1% of GMV. And if you look at benchmarks, there's significant opportunity above that. And we -- as long as we continue to add value to sellers we think that will be a continued opportunity.  On the second side on the investments, we laid out in July, the strategic plan and started with the category idea on verticals specifically of reinventing the experience, changing the NPS and driving GMV. And if you look at the results of the past few quarters, this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have triple-digit growth in sneakers. This is a business that had been declining double-digits. Our watches went from 16% last quarter to 38%. More importantly though we're seeing customer satisfaction metrics in the 80s and 90s. And so we think this concept of really applying it to other parts of the business. So what you're going to see over the next coming quarters and years is us continuing to expand that focus and invest in and roll out additional categories.  Like I said upfront, the majority of our big categories like parts and accessories, electronics, fashion all have similar opportunities to follow that playbook. So we're going to continue to do it in a balanced way as I talked about in July, managing what we spend with what we see as the growth opportunity. And we've already done that in a lot of areas especially in marketing over the past couple of quarters.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess just first as a follow-up to the previous question, it was interesting that you took up take rate and watches. I guess, Jamie if you step back and look at take rate overall base take rate, are there more opportunities to take uptake rate? Are there services you can continue to add that exclude advertising that would allow you to have that higher take rate?  And then I guess as you guys make some of these muscle moves in specific verticals, any sense as to how large these verticals are as a percent of total GMV? And then a follow-up on fashion. I know you've been doing some off-price fashion tests in the UK timing on rolling that out to the US? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So on take rate, obviously, with payments we actually think we are -- for the vast majority of sellers they're going to experience lower fees even though it will mean at least $0.5 billion of operating income to our business. And we continue to look for ways that we can drive kind of the new experience. The off eBay advertising is a great example of that.  And to your comment on watches, it's really kind of a category-by-category basis of us looking at what value are we creating and what opportunities are there for our sellers. On how large this can be? Why we're focused on the non-new in season is because we believe it's a $500 million total addressable market. And if you look at our categories on the site, we have high single-digit, low double-digit penetration. And so we think there's lots of opportunity.  And coming back to the core of what we said about re-commerce, I think more and more especially in younger generations are interested in the re-commerce of pre-loved items. And so it's why we're leaning in so much towards that. Also we're seeing this strategy is working with C2C. So our C2C again, outgrew our B2C growth 34% versus 21%. But that only -- not only brings the unique inventory, but it turns those buyers into twice as valuable buyers when they try casual selling.  And then lastly, the tests we've been doing on the brand outlet side in the UK has been performing well. We're growing double-digits ahead of market rates. And as I mentioned before, what's great is that while we went out and sourced all of the initial programs to kind of build that up and now the brands are actually calling us and asking us to be part of that program. So you've seen this playbook from us over the past few quarters where we're trying things in different markets, finding success and then rolling them out more broadly. So we've had a lot of success with sneakers in the US and we're now rolling that out to UK, Canada and Australia this quarter. And you could see us continue to follow that playbook.\nEdward Yruma: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a follow-up to the prior question. I think last quarter, you framed GMV covered by new category experiences and it was single-digits or kind of less than 10% of GMV in the fourth quarter. And just curious if you could update that metric, where these new category experiences reach this quarter and maybe what could be achieved by year-end? Any comments on that would be helpful.  And then Jamie I'm just curious, if you could talk about what are the remaining seller pain points that you're really focused on? You've clearly done a lot of work with payments and maybe reach on the advertising side. But what are you hearing from sellers as to the features that they'd like to see? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So look what I'd say is that on the categories that we've tackled thus far we're still in single-digit percentage territory. And what we've said is that we believe that over half over the -- coming years over half of the GMV is addressable in this type of opportunity and especially in some of these major categories. And frankly there's probably opportunities across all categories over time to be able to ever change it. We really wanted to see if the thesis that we laid out worked and it's been working pretty consistently and that's the feedback we're getting from buyers and sellers and we're obviously seeing it in the business. There's a lot of opportunity for us on the seller side. So on the store side, we're migrating all of our stores to the NextGen platform. That's mostly complete, which is a much better platform for them. This quarter we're rolling out CRM capabilities, which has been a long-standing ask of theirs, so that they can remarket to buyers through packing slips, through e-mail et cetera. So that's been pretty significant. And then even things like the customization that we're launching is a long-standing seller request to drive their business. We didn't talk much about this but one of the pain points that's existed in the eBay community for our sellers has been unpaid items for -- since the company really started payments was divorced from -- or separated from purchase, and so sellers sometimes would have a transaction close without getting paid. The ability -- now that we've launched manage payments and we're migrating a bunch of new technologies, we actually reduced that by 80% for our sellers. So that's a pain point that we're really happy to be able to eliminate for them. And then on the C2C side, it\u2019s really about making it easier, why you see us launching things like image base listing? It is because we want to take all of the friction of the experience and make it a really short couple of minute process to get your items up on to the platforms. So, we\u2019re doing a lot more education, things around the seller business, really focused on continuing to drive that C2C business. So I think each quarter, we'll be rolling out features that really address this key thesis of taking all the friction of the experience and making this the best marketplace in the world.\nTom Champion: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nShweta Khajuria: This is Shweta for Mark. I was wondering if you could please comment on buyer growth. You laid out some of the initiatives that you are taking to continue to drive growth. So where do you think -- what do you think could be a sustainable growth rate for buyers? And then the second thing, you also pointed to some of your top category and that includes collectibles, home and garden, electronics, fashion, parts and accessories. I may have missed some, but how big are they currently today as a part of -- as a percentage of GMV? And how do you think the cross-category shift plays out in face of reopening? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So first on buyers look in Q1, we added 7% to our active buyer count to $187 million globally. Over the past year we've added 13 million buyers to the marketplace. And what we're seeing is that those buyers are behaving with strong performance like pre-pandemic. So they're not just coming to eBay for during the pandemic time period and leaving. We're converting a good amount to our strategy of long-standing enthusiasts. We're really focused on the first 90 days for buyers and making sure that they have a great experience on the site. And what you're seeing is that the NPS is up, especially in focused categories like watches and sneakers, certified refurbished where you now have a two-year warranty and have the free returns. So we're really pleased with that. The cross-category nature and the size of these categories is one of the best assets of eBay. We talked last quarter about our sneaker buyer where we acquire a new Gen Z buyer; they end up buying $500 in sneakers but another $2,000 outside sneakers. We're seeing the same type of thing in watches where we're acquiring a buyer of new high-end watches and they're spending thousands of dollars outside of other categories. So we continue to lean in because it's a huge accelerator for us to get buyers purchasing cross-category and a lot of the marketing technology that we've built and we worked on, the AI with recommendations et cetera is really centered on this idea of capturing buyers and having them transact in multiple categories.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: There's going to be a lot of moving parts this year with e-commerce facing the comps and it's not just you. And so what do you think is the best way to measure your progress this year as we think about it? Is it market share versus e-commerce spend? And what specific milestones if GMV matches your outlook, should we be looking for that really show you're making progress this year? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So I mean one that we're clearly looking at is with last year being such an anomaly with the pandemic is a year over two-year and the growth that we're seeing there, which we're excited by. Clearly we'll be lapping some of the buyer, extensive buyer growth that we had in last Q2 but we're looking at the performance of those active buyers on a go-forward basis and we're pretty pleased with that performance. And then the last thing I'd say is that, look, a lot of the stuff that we're doing on the core strategy is really about the long-term growth. So we're going to see things in the short-term variances versus prior year. But I think for me the core thing is the playbook that we put in place is working. This thesis of really changing the growth trajectory of the category by investing in the playbook is what the team is focused on. And we're going to stay on that for the near to medium future. If I look at coming into this in 2019, we were I think declining 2% from a GMV perspective. And if you look at our revenue growth projected next quarter, we're looking at double-digit revenue growth. So we feel good about where we're positioned coming out of the pandemic.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. So Jamie, now that the US payment penetration is -- seems to be approaching the finish line here, is there anything you can say about how the simplified checkout versus what the buyer has had to go through before? And how that might be resulting in, hopefully a decrease to the overall friction and hence an increase in conversion rate or purchase velocity? And I guess as a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on advertising, as an increasing portion of the transactions end up being C2C or what might be more unique, collectible or enthusiast items, should we still be thinking that that type of gross merchandise value is still appropriate for PLA because it seems like advertising should work best for probably those categories where there are multiple sellers trying to sell a fairly homogeneous item? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first on the payment side, I would say, yes, not only buyers now have more choices of how to pay including Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit card, debit, PayPal, et cetera. But you no longer have to set up two different accounts. You no longer have to manage a claims process or returns process in two different areas. It's one eBay money back guarantee. So to us it dramatically simplifies the whole experience for a buyer and makes it easier. They keep that payment on file and it's just a dramatically easier experience. And then it's helping the seller too because I mentioned the unpaid item example earlier on the call but also the ability for them to manage all their business in one place makes it much more streamlined to just run a business on eBay. On the Promoted Listings, we see opportunities really across every category and every price point of GMV. The beauty of the CPA model that we've had of the cost per acquisition model has been just the simplicity of it of just adding the percentage and it makes it really easy. But the PC model that we're launching also gives the opportunity to really kind of push volume in a different way with a different set of capabilities. But even on single and unique items, people want to promote those items and get more exposure for them. They have for the longest period of time. It's why we're launching the ad feature for auction and testing that is to really go after it. And it's still not -- we still have a lot of opportunity across our listings to increase the penetration. Like I said before, we're only at 1% of GMV.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first can you provide some color on what categories are specifically seeing reversals with mobility improving in second quarter? And then on the commentary around the second half GMV trends, comps are also progressively getting easier once you navigate past second quarter, but you're saying that potentially GMV trends could be similar to second quarter. I know there are always certain one-time items in 2Q and there's potentially some geographies coming out later in terms of mobility. But can you parse out between those? And do you expect further reversal in terms of kind of comparable basis on volumes beyond 2Q?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. I'll take the first one and I'll let Andy take the second. So on the category piece, we talked about last year was, people started by panic buying everything that was related to kind of health needs across the board on eBay. And then we saw that expand into kind of stay-at-home categories, fitness and laptops, those types of things in our electronics business. And then, really went kind of across the board over the course of the year. So as you think about this year it's really just a change against the backdrop of what we were buying last year. I'll let Andy take the second part of that.\nAndy Cring: Yes. And look, we didn't provide guidance for the second half just because of the dynamic environment and the wide range of outcomes. You are right. When you look at the comps for Q3 and Q4 they are modestly easier as we go through the year. The second piece, I'd say is, we continue to expect to see the underlying business perform. I think the wildcard in all of this is the macro factors, mobility and stimulus, incredibly hard to predict. There's certainly some benefit in the second quarter to those. And it's possible that as regions open up and mobility improves that that offsets some of the comps, the easier comps that we see in the second half. It's a scenario. It's just -- it's hard to accurately predict where mobility heads.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it.\nJoe Billante: Operator, we've got time for one more.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about -- you've done a great job of tackling and handling these categories with sneakers and luxury watches authenticated and now trading cards. And as someone who sold a Barry Sanders rookie card, it is a much better experience. So the question is, as we sort of look ahead to the next 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of GMV that you're going to redo, what is sort of the main technological constraint that you think is going to sort of dictate how quickly or slowly you're going to be able to sort of redo the rest of the categories on the platform? And as you're talking about the back half, are you assuming you're going to have more categories rolled on to the new stronger interface yet?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So the first thing I'd say is that, on the category piece, in some cases the categories have overlapped in terms of features or capabilities we need to build in order to make that a winning NPS for us. So we build authentication once. It took us a couple of months to build it out, but then we're able to roll it out to the next category in a couple of weeks and expand that geographically. And so, I think that's actually true for a lot of areas, where there's components or features that we're building specifically to drive the NPS of a category that will be applicable to a broad set of categories across the experience. And in terms of pace, we're going to continue to do what we've done before, which is, roll them out in a specific geography, make sure that we're seeing the intended impact and then roll it out across the board. We don't really want to talk about which category is next and what we're focused on for competitive reasons. But I would just say that, we're really pleased with the playbook. We're really pleased that we're able to drive significant growth and a significant change in trajectory and most importantly, a significant change in the customer experience. And so, you're just going to see us continue feature after feature, category after category. The second thing I'd say is that the verticals is not the only investment that we're making. A lot of our investment is going to site-wide investments that impact all categories. Clearly, that's true for payments and advertising, but the same is true across our seller tools, across our API business, across the CRM and couponing capabilities that we just rolled out, investments that we have in search and in SEO, which apply to the whole business. So the way I think about them is kind of, a good amount of investment in vertical to really change the NPS of those categories, but a significant amount of site-wide investments as well, which lifts all categories. So that's the strategy. That's how we think about it and we're really pleased with the performance.\nOperator: There are no further time for questions. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andy Cring",
            "content": "Thanks Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our first quarter financial highlights starting on slide four of the earnings presentation. The first quarter was another great quarter for eBay. We generated over $27 billion of GMV, our highest GMV quarter ever. We delivered $3 billion of revenue, $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS, and $855 million of free cash flow, while returning $414 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on slide 5. We exited the quarter with 187 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth consistent with the fourth quarter. We've added 13 million buyers to the ecosystem since the beginning of 2020 and are experiencing retention rates that remain in line with historical trends. And as we said throughout 2020, we continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts. Moving to slide 6. In Q1, we enabled $27.5 billion of marketplace GMV, up 24% accelerating six points versus the fourth quarter. On a spot basis this represents growth of 29%, an acceleration of eight points versus the fourth quarter. As over 60% of our GMV is generated outside of the US, we saw a five-point translation benefit due to the weaker dollar. On platform volume, which represents nearly 85% of total GMV grew at 28% a seven-point acceleration versus Q4, driven by site-wide product experience improvements, progress we're making in key categories, increased mobility restrictions and additional stimulus in the US. Our platform business in Korea was relatively stable versus the fourth quarter at 4% year-on-year growth. In the US, we generated $10.4 billion of GMV in Q1, up 36% year-on-year accelerating 11 points from the fourth quarter, driven by mobility dynamics, stimulus payments and strength in our core categories including collectibles. International GMV was up 17% year-on-year, a two-point acceleration versus the fourth quarter, driven by strength in our core categories and mobility dynamics. Turning to revenue on slide 7, our Q1 net revenue was $3 billion, up 38% and accelerating 10 points on an FX-neutral basis. As Jamie said this was our strongest quarter since 2005. On a spot basis this represents growth of 42%. We delivered $2.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 40%, accelerating nine points from the fourth quarter mostly driven by our payments migration and volume strength. In managed payments, we continue to execute and have made great progress on seller migration to the new payments platform. As Jamie mentioned, we process over half of our global on-platform volume in the quarter, which contributed approximately 15 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2020. Transaction take rate was 10% for the quarter accelerating 20 basis points driven by managed payments, partially offset by category and seller mix in addition to currency hedging impacts. When we started the managed payments journey, we expect it to progressively increase monetization of our site, while delivering better seller economics and improved experience for both buyers and sellers and overall revenue growth for the business. We continue to deliver across all of these dimensions. We delivered $291 million of marketing services and other revenue up 22%, accelerating 19 points from the fourth quarter, driven by first-party growth in Korea which grew approximately 120% in addition to strength in advertising and shipping. Turning to slide eight and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. This is up approximately 140 basis points year-on-year driven by volume and advertising, partially offset by product and marketing reinvestments, the impact of managed payments growth, and FX. For each of the non-GAAP expense buckets, volume and a higher take rate provided leverage as a percent of revenue. I will provide additional context for other significant drivers. Cost of revenue was up nearly four points year-over-year as leverage was more than offset by scaling managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea. As a reminder, the managed payments cost structure includes payment processing costs that scale in line with payments revenue. This dynamic has been fully contemplated in our 2022 margin targets. Sales and marketing expense was down nearly two points versus the prior year as leverage was partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy, strategic reinvestments in online marketing, and FX. Product development costs were down 10 basis points as leverage was mostly offset by investments in end-to-end product experience in addition to managed payments and advertising. G&A was down nearly two points primarily from leverage and a disciplined cost control. Transaction losses were down approximately one and a half points from the benefit of fee netting in our managed payments initiative and lapping COVID-driven deferred fees and seller protection increases. Turning to EPS on slide nine, in Q1, we delivered $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS up 59% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, growth in payments and advertising, and the reduction in share count driven by our repurchases, partially offset by investments in product and marketing. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82 up 44% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by the fair value of the Adyen warrant. Moving to slide 10, in Q1, we had a very strong quarter of cash generation, finishing Q1 with $855 million of free cash flow, a 65% increase year-on-year driven by topline growth, increased working capital, and lower capital expenditures. Turning to slide 11, for the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $3.9 billion and debt of $7 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $55.70 per share amounting to $292 million. We exited the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Moving to slide 12 and investments, when we announced the classifieds transaction with Adevinta on July 20 of last year, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and the value of Adevinta shares at that time. As of April 27th, the Adevinta share price had appreciated by nearly 37%, which increased the value of the deal to over $12.7 billion. We continue to expect the deal to close in the second quarter with the cash portion of the transaction providing approximately $2 billion net of tax. Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of over $700 million year-on-year. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. We remain excited about both of these investments, the optionality they provide and the significant value each can generate for our shareholders. Turning to guidance on slide 13. For Q2 we are projecting revenue between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion, growing between 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis, representing 12% to 14% growth on a spot basis. This assumes marketplace volume declines high single to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis, representing a decline of mid to high single digits on a spot basis. This volume guidance is driven by three main components. First, the negative impact from lapping our second largest quarter ever, which was fueled by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions. Second, the ongoing benefit from macro factors, including mobility and stimulus payments across our on-platform businesses, which we estimate are contributing high single-digit growth this quarter. Third and most importantly, continued delivery on initiatives driving us towards our vision, many of which Jamie highlighted earlier. On a year-over-two-year basis, this guidance represents growth in the high teens on a spot basis, which is more than $4 billion of incremental GMV versus the same quarter in 2019, as our sellers and buyers have discovered or rediscovered the power and reach of our global platform. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.96 per share, representing a 6% to 11% decrease, primarily driven by volume deleverage and continued investments in product and marketing in support of our strategy, partially offset by managed payments and a lower share count. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in Q2. Finally, on Q2 our EPS guidance assumes approximately $400 million of share buyback. While we aren't providing guidance for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context on our path forward. On volume, our conviction in the vision is increasing and we are confident these efforts will continue to drive additional growth as we scale. While difficult to forecast, mobility will likely continue to improve throughout the second half, pressuring growth. And when combined with easier lapping, that could result in second half FX-neutral volume growth rates similar to those of our second quarter guidance. For buyers, similar to GMV we expect growth will be pressured as we lap periods of high buyer acquisition. We expect revenue growth will continue to materially outpace GMV growth, as our monetization initiatives drive a higher effective take rate. Specifically in payments, we're more than halfway done with the migration of on-platform GMV and expect to deliver at least $1.7 billion of revenue in 2021, well on our way to realizing at least $2 billion of revenue in 2022. On margin we are on target and remain committed to delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We said along the way that margin accretion won't be linear. And in 2021, we expect margin will be approximately 29% for the full year. With regards to cash and capital allocation, we will continue to deliver strong free cash flow. We remain committed to our targets and tenants and we will continue to optimize our capital structure within them. Specifically, on buybacks. For the full year we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of stock excluding deal proceeds. We will update plans for use of proceeds from the classifieds transaction at the time of closure. For our Korea business, we have a strategic review process underway, which includes the possibility of a sale, with interest from multiple parties. We are exploring that interest and we'll provide an update when we have material information to share. And finally, on FX. At current rates, we'd expect the benefit of currency to be smaller in the second half, as we lap a relatively weaker US dollar. In conclusion, Q1 was a record quarter for eBay and we entered Q2 excited about the path forward to deliver on all aspects of our long-term plan. We will continue to execute on our multi-year monetization initiatives, which are driving material benefits to our customers and shareholders, as we move towards at least $2 billion of revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in managed payments and the next $1 billion of advertising revenue. We are delivering on our core strategy, increasing customer satisfaction and attracting and retaining customers as we capitalize on a $0.5 trillion addressable market that is growing double-digits. We're delivering consistent strong free cash flow and continue to deploy that cash in a disciplined manner by investing in our platform for the long-term and returning capital to shareholders. On margins, we remain on target for at least two points of improvement in 2022 compared to 2019, while we continue to drive efficiencies and strategically reinvest to accelerate growth. And finally, we're executing on our portfolio reviews and will deploy capital in a disciplined manner balancing reinvestment in the core, capacity for mergers and acquisitions, paying a dividend and buying back our undervalued stock. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator? Yes, Ross. On the other two questions on Q2, and Q1 versus Q2 dynamics. I mean, clearly, the first quarter was a huge quarter for us, as I said, our largest quarter ever. As we indicated in January, we had seen increasing restrictions late last year through most of our markets and those kind of persisted into the first quarter, and the growth in the first quarter driven by two main factors. As we've said, the continued underlying performance and then the correlation between mobility and GMV. And then as the quarter progressed, a lot of further developments and things we learned along the way back to January pace of vaccines were very different from where they are today. Mobility has improved throughout the quarter in most markets. And then you've got as you mentioned the impact of stimulus payments in the US, which it's hard to say exactly the impact, but -- or when it started or when it will stop, but we believe the peak of that impact was probably in the March time frame. So when you look then on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the biggest difference between Q1 and the outlook for Q2 would be the fact that the stimulus -- or not stimulus, sorry, but the mobility is in a better place today than it was at the beginning of the first quarter. Underlying performance continues to be great. And then as we've said, progress on payments is continuing to be very positive as well. That leads a little bit into your second question on margin rate for the year. I think a couple of things to consider. We're still on target for the 30% that we said for next year, and we have said all along, it's not going to be linear. We're going to have quarters where we're up or down, and we're going to continue to balance growth and margin along the way. A couple of things, when you look at Q1 relative to the rest of the year and then the second half -- and again, you hit on a couple. I think it's important to remember, our historical trend is that Q1 is a bit higher than the rest of the year, and typically higher than Q2. Last year, that was a bit muted with the amount of growth that we saw, but I think this year we're -- with the relative size of the two quarters more on that trend. And then without getting into a specific walk on the second half, I think three things. One would be, moderating growth, which will have some impact on volume and deleverage. We continue to invest for long-term health. So we're not going to be managing to a quarterly margin target. We're working towards longer-term business health. And then you did call it, and it's a great problem, which is payments is scaling rapidly. It's delivering a tremendous amount of incremental op income and it does come with a minor bit of pressure on operating margin, but we feel great about that progress and what it does for the P&L. Yes. And look, we didn't provide guidance for the second half just because of the dynamic environment and the wide range of outcomes. You are right. When you look at the comps for Q3 and Q4 they are modestly easier as we go through the year. The second piece, I'd say is, we continue to expect to see the underlying business perform. I think the wildcard in all of this is the macro factors, mobility and stimulus, incredibly hard to predict. There's certainly some benefit in the second quarter to those. And it's possible that as regions open up and mobility improves that that offsets some of the comps, the easier comps that we see in the second half. It's a scenario. It's just -- it's hard to accurately predict where mobility heads."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll begin the call with key highlights from the first quarter. Then, I will share some reflections from my first 12 months as CEO and provide an update on the status of our tech-led re-imagination. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The first quarter of 2021 was an excellent start to the year for sellers and buyers on eBay. Gross merchandise volume grew 24%, ahead of expectations. Revenue grew 38% outpacing volume, primarily due to payments and advertising. This is the fastest our revenues have grown since 2005, and we lean [ph] further into technology and vertical marketing investments, but still delivered $1.09 in non-GAAP earnings per share above our expectation. Importantly, our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 8% to 20 million globally, more small businesses are joining the platform and more consumers are engaging and selling. C2C GMV growth outpaced B2C for the fourth quarter in a row. This is positive for the long term as consumer sellers bring unique inventory at compelling prices and spend more than twice as much as buyers, who don't sell. Active buyers grew 7% to 187 million globally. We are retaining buyers acquired over the last year at similar rates as pre-pandemic level, and we're seeing higher customer satisfaction in several categories as well as increased spend per buyer. We have continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives payments and advertising, which contribute to a seamless customer experience, increase our platform monetization and deliver compelling financial results. Managed payments ended Q1 with over four million sellers migrated. This includes millions of consumer sellers and hundreds of thousands of businesses globally. During the quarter, eBay managed payments representing over 52% of on-platform volume, up from 38% last quarter. In the US, we exited the quarter over 80% complete. By applying what we learned in previous markets, rollouts in France, Italy, and Spain progressed at an even faster pace, and we're on track to launch Greater China this quarter and all remaining markets by the middle of the year. We continue to see higher seller satisfaction due to a simpler end-to-end experience that reduces cost and complexity. For many years before managed payments, sellers had to manage delays between purchase and payment across two platforms that tied up their inventory. As sellers migrate to managed payments, that pain point has resolved saving time and money. And in Q1, we reduced unpaid items by approximately 80% on fixed-price transaction. We remain on track to complete the vast majority of the payments transition by the end of this year, which will deliver our stated financial goals at the least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in annualized operating income in 2022. In Q1, advertising growth outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings which delivered close to $224 million of revenue, up 58%. More than 1.3 million sellers promoted close to 400 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by increased seller adoption and AI improvements that increased conversion. Inspired by the success of Promoted Listings over the past few years, we are investing aggressively in innovation. We reached $1 billion of advertising revenue in 2020, primarily through Promoted Listings which leverages a risk free CPA model for fixed price inventory. To capture our next billion, we are running multiple experiments, including an ad product for auctions and cost per click capabilities. We are also exploring a new capability that expands seller exposure by increasing off-eBay traffic to promoted listings. Q1 clearly demonstrates that the ongoing execution of our long-term vision is driving better results. Small business and consumer sellers are thriving, and buyers are finding unique items at great prices. We have seen strong growth in volume, revenue, and earnings over the past year due to a combination of mobility driven tailwinds and the execution of our multiyear monetization initiatives. And we are driving value through portfolio optimization and returning capital to shareholders. Despite these notable achievements, there's still a tremendous amount of potential to be realized. Now, I'd like to take a step back to a year ago when I rejoined this remarkable company as CEO. I knew eBay as a pioneer in e-commerce with a globally recognized brand, robust organic traffic, and long-standing customer relationships. And I've always been inspired by the purpose and special culture it creates. Last July, we set out a vision for a tech-led reimagination of eBay. First, we believe that we can drive growth in our core by significantly increasing customer satisfaction. Second, we saw the need to better serve our small businesses and consumer sellers to become their platform of choice. And third, we identified the opportunity to evolve our relationship with buyers to drive better, long-term retention. I am confident we can deliver on these three pillars positioning us to more effectively compete and win in a huge and growing addressable market. Our results to date are very encouraging. Our underlying growth is accelerating, sellers and buyers are growing, and we are making progress in our pursuit to be the best global marketplace to buy and sell. Simply put, our strategy is working. Let me share some examples with you. In the US we are growing our core. In Q1, sneakers valued above $100 grew at a triple-digit rate once again. Since launching authentication, we verified hundreds of thousands of sneakers, and we're seeing buyer satisfaction above 80 as a result. In addition, we are expanding our engagement with Gen Z and Millennials through a wide range of social channels. Based on the tremendous success we've seen in the US, we are rapidly expanding identical capabilities to other major markets. We have set up local authentication centers and are launching in the UK, Australia, and Canada this quarter. These centers will also unlock cross-border trade opportunities in sneakers and in other categories.  In luxury watches, we saw growth accelerate from 16% in Q4 to 38% in Q1 in the US. For authenticated items, we are seeing customer satisfaction that was close to 90% and is changing customer behavior. Sellers are listing more items and seeing a higher price realization. Buyers are visiting eBay more often and spending more. One of the key advantages of our platform is cross-category shopping. Our luxury watch buyers like our sneakers enthusiasts spend thousands of dollars on other categories across the platform. In addition, based on the value we are delivering in luxury watches, we recently raised fees in this category to create more investment capacity. For our certified refurbished experience, eBay sellers continue to see strong velocity and we've expanded in the US to over 150 brands. We've also rolled certified refurbished out to the UK, Canada, and Germany with more than 100 top brands signed up already. Buyers love the low prices on like-new products as well as free shipping, extended warranties, and extended returns. Now I want to highlight the next core category where we see significant potential, trading cards, a key part of our collectibles business. eBay is a market leader in this category with the widest selection across all price levels. We've seen explosive growth to start the year. In the US, GMV was over $1 billion in Q1, which represents more than half of 2020's record setting volume. Active buyers of trading cards doubled and existing buyers purchased more items at higher prices than last year. To dramatically simplify selling, we've recently launched image-based scanning for our top selling trading cards. In addition, we introduced a new low cost track and shipping service and aggressively market it to buyers on social and enthusiast forums. We plan to launch more innovation for trading cards throughout this year. Another area of focus for us is customization. Beginning next month in the UK and Germany, we will offer a new capability to all sellers to offer personalized goods in categories, such as home, fashion and jewelry. This will allow buyers to find and enter specific customization requests to the seller. In the past, this process was manual, which limited GMV. But we believe this new experience can significantly improve customer satisfaction, bring more supply onto the platform, and capture more growth. We plan to expand this capability to all major markets in the coming months. As I mentioned upfront, our playbook to grow the core is working. We have a series of innovations rolling out to more markets throughout the year. While we've only touched a small percentage of global volume so far, all of our largest eBay categories collectibles, home and garden, fashion, electronics, and parts and accessories have addressable opportunities that can benefit from this playbook. In addition to category-specific changes, we are rolling out site-wide improvements for all sellers. For consumer, sellers and small businesses we are focused on significantly reducing complexity, helping maximize value and driving sustainable growth. We believe these changes will increase seller satisfaction and grow the number of active sellers on the platform. Here are some examples of what we are doing. Image-based listing can remove up to 75% of the time it takes to list an item. We have activated this feature in trading cards, and we plan to expand to multiple categories and geographies throughout the year. Last quarter we talked about how we have migrated almost all of our store subscribers to our new platform that increases traffic to their items by approximately 20%. This quarter we empowered sellers with new CRM features, allowing them to directly issue coupons to acquire buyers. In addition, they can set coupon budgets, include QR codes on packing slips, and drive repeat business to their eBay stores. Recently we opened up Terapeak product research free for all Seller Hub users in several markets, including price insights and listing quality reports. In addition, we launched sourcing insights that help sellers analyze trending categories, top products and signals what inventory is most likely to sell. To acquire more buyers, we are also adding new ad formats to our display and social marketing, including video and we improved the inventory feeds that power them. Once we acquire these buyers, we are making changes to increase engagement and trust in their first 90 days and beyond. As an example, we are leveraging a mobile-first approach and revamping key communications buyers received. We are seeing increased engagement from Gen Z and millennial customers through social shopping, such as eBay Sneaker Showdown. For our experienced buyers, we continue to optimize the end-to-end shopping experience. In Q1, we increased conversion by improving our search engine's understanding of longer complex queries, and we added functionality to help buyers identify free local pickup items in their community. We are excited that all three of our strategic pillars are producing volume, seller and buyer growth, but we have a long runway ahead of us. We will continue to drive our investment decisions both organic and inorganic in pursuit of achieving this vision. While I'm pleased with our business results, I am more proud of the way our employees and our platform are fulfilling our purpose of providing economic opportunity for all. As part of our commitment to empowering small businesses everywhere, we announced an investment of $25 million into the Clear Vision Impact Fund to help support small and medium-sized minority-owned businesses that support historically underserved communities. We continue to support the UK's National Health Care Service efforts and I'm happy to report that we're now up to 2 billion PPE items distributed utilizing eBay's technology. Additionally, we remain active in philanthropy during Q1. We raised over $35 million through eBay for charity. The company also contributed to Asian Americans Advanced Justice and supported employee giving during Black History Month and the Lunar New Year and we quadrupled employee matching gift limits through the eBay Foundation. Finally, another area that inspires me is eBay's impact on the planet. Many companies make admirable investments into adjacent programs, but at eBay sustainability is the core of our business. Since eBay was founded over 25 years ago, re-commerce or the resale of pre-owned goods has been an integral part of our platform and purpose. Our community connects and trades pre-owned items that hold meaning and usefulness and keeps these items out of landfills. A recent survey confirmed that re-commerce resonates with our customers. In the US, 87% of respondents say they have sold pre-owned goods in the last 12 months. And they aren't just selling 81% of Gen V customers surveyed said that buying pre-owned items has become more common in the last year. In summary, we are making great progress on the tech library imagination of eBay. We delivered historically strong Q1 results, putting us in a stronger position today than we thought we'd be coming into the year. Looking forward, we are excited because our long-term strategy is working. By increasing customer satisfaction, we are accelerating our core business while attracting and retaining sellers and buyers. There is more work to do, but I couldn't be prouder of the eBay team. They are focused and driven and they work hard every day to innovate, keeping our customers at the forefront. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy? Yes. I'll start with the trading card ones and then I'll let Andy talk about the other two. So, yes, we've always had a great history in the Collectibles business and a great history in trading cards. Obviously, Q1 was really strong doing it over $1 billion in the quarter, which was more than half of last year's record setting. And I'd say in general, what we see is that when we take category-by-category, and we changed the NPS, and we changed the customer experience, that changes the buyers and sellers and the GMV follows. And in that case, it's similar to what we saw in sneakers and in watches where that change led to a dramatically different performance. We see customization, which we just launched this quarter as another one of those opportunities. We do millions of items on the site today, but we do it in a way that's really full of a lot of friction between the buyer and the seller, and this makes it really seamless and I think gives us the opportunity to open up more GMV. But as I said upfront, we haven't even touched the -- some of the major categories that we have like home and garden, fashion, electronics, and parts and accessories. These are big core categories that all have addressable opportunities that we think can benefit from this playbook. Yeah. So, first on the monetization side. So look obviously both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about -- we feel great about the business in part, because our sellers are seeing a great return on the ad spend. And we think there's a lot of opportunity left from that perspective to help them be able to move their products with velocity. So what we're announcing this quarter is that, we're basically rolling out three new experiments or pilots in our advertising business. The first being placement for our auctions. So the growth that we've seen to date has really just been on the fixed price business. So that will be a new capability. We're also testing a CPC-based capability for our sellers, which is a new potential growth vector. And we're looking at off eBay opportunities for our sellers to even further increase their exposure. So we continue to look at the monetization and are we adding value to sellers? A great example for that is in watches this quarter, we saw an opportunity to increase our fees there, because of the value that we're creating for our sellers in that category. Overall, when I look at advertising, it's still only 1% of GMV. And if you look at benchmarks, there's significant opportunity above that. And we -- as long as we continue to add value to sellers we think that will be a continued opportunity.  On the second side on the investments, we laid out in July, the strategic plan and started with the category idea on verticals specifically of reinventing the experience, changing the NPS and driving GMV. And if you look at the results of the past few quarters, this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have triple-digit growth in sneakers. This is a business that had been declining double-digits. Our watches went from 16% last quarter to 38%. More importantly though we're seeing customer satisfaction metrics in the 80s and 90s. And so we think this concept of really applying it to other parts of the business. So what you're going to see over the next coming quarters and years is us continuing to expand that focus and invest in and roll out additional categories.  Like I said upfront, the majority of our big categories like parts and accessories, electronics, fashion all have similar opportunities to follow that playbook. So we're going to continue to do it in a balanced way as I talked about in July, managing what we spend with what we see as the growth opportunity. And we've already done that in a lot of areas especially in marketing over the past couple of quarters. Yes. So on take rate, obviously, with payments we actually think we are -- for the vast majority of sellers they're going to experience lower fees even though it will mean at least $0.5 billion of operating income to our business. And we continue to look for ways that we can drive kind of the new experience. The off eBay advertising is a great example of that.  And to your comment on watches, it's really kind of a category-by-category basis of us looking at what value are we creating and what opportunities are there for our sellers. On how large this can be? Why we're focused on the non-new in season is because we believe it's a $500 million total addressable market. And if you look at our categories on the site, we have high single-digit, low double-digit penetration. And so we think there's lots of opportunity.  And coming back to the core of what we said about re-commerce, I think more and more especially in younger generations are interested in the re-commerce of pre-loved items. And so it's why we're leaning in so much towards that. Also we're seeing this strategy is working with C2C. So our C2C again, outgrew our B2C growth 34% versus 21%. But that only -- not only brings the unique inventory, but it turns those buyers into twice as valuable buyers when they try casual selling.  And then lastly, the tests we've been doing on the brand outlet side in the UK has been performing well. We're growing double-digits ahead of market rates. And as I mentioned before, what's great is that while we went out and sourced all of the initial programs to kind of build that up and now the brands are actually calling us and asking us to be part of that program. So you've seen this playbook from us over the past few quarters where we're trying things in different markets, finding success and then rolling them out more broadly. So we've had a lot of success with sneakers in the US and we're now rolling that out to UK, Canada and Australia this quarter. And you could see us continue to follow that playbook. Yeah. So look what I'd say is that on the categories that we've tackled thus far we're still in single-digit percentage territory. And what we've said is that we believe that over half over the -- coming years over half of the GMV is addressable in this type of opportunity and especially in some of these major categories. And frankly there's probably opportunities across all categories over time to be able to ever change it. We really wanted to see if the thesis that we laid out worked and it's been working pretty consistently and that's the feedback we're getting from buyers and sellers and we're obviously seeing it in the business. There's a lot of opportunity for us on the seller side. So on the store side, we're migrating all of our stores to the NextGen platform. That's mostly complete, which is a much better platform for them. This quarter we're rolling out CRM capabilities, which has been a long-standing ask of theirs, so that they can remarket to buyers through packing slips, through e-mail et cetera. So that's been pretty significant. And then even things like the customization that we're launching is a long-standing seller request to drive their business. We didn't talk much about this but one of the pain points that's existed in the eBay community for our sellers has been unpaid items for -- since the company really started payments was divorced from -- or separated from purchase, and so sellers sometimes would have a transaction close without getting paid. The ability -- now that we've launched manage payments and we're migrating a bunch of new technologies, we actually reduced that by 80% for our sellers. So that's a pain point that we're really happy to be able to eliminate for them. And then on the C2C side, it's really about making it easier, why you see us launching things like image base listing? It is because we want to take all of the friction of the experience and make it a really short couple of minute process to get your items up on to the platforms. So, we're doing a lot more education, things around the seller business, really focused on continuing to drive that C2C business. So I think each quarter, we'll be rolling out features that really address this key thesis of taking all the friction of the experience and making this the best marketplace in the world. Yeah. So first on buyers look in Q1, we added 7% to our active buyer count to $187 million globally. Over the past year we've added 13 million buyers to the marketplace. And what we're seeing is that those buyers are behaving with strong performance like pre-pandemic. So they're not just coming to eBay for during the pandemic time period and leaving. We're converting a good amount to our strategy of long-standing enthusiasts. We're really focused on the first 90 days for buyers and making sure that they have a great experience on the site. And what you're seeing is that the NPS is up, especially in focused categories like watches and sneakers, certified refurbished where you now have a two-year warranty and have the free returns. So we're really pleased with that. The cross-category nature and the size of these categories is one of the best assets of eBay. We talked last quarter about our sneaker buyer where we acquire a new Gen Z buyer; they end up buying $500 in sneakers but another $2,000 outside sneakers. We're seeing the same type of thing in watches where we're acquiring a buyer of new high-end watches and they're spending thousands of dollars outside of other categories. So we continue to lean in because it's a huge accelerator for us to get buyers purchasing cross-category and a lot of the marketing technology that we've built and we worked on, the AI with recommendations et cetera is really centered on this idea of capturing buyers and having them transact in multiple categories. Yes. So I mean one that we're clearly looking at is with last year being such an anomaly with the pandemic is a year over two-year and the growth that we're seeing there, which we're excited by. Clearly we'll be lapping some of the buyer, extensive buyer growth that we had in last Q2 but we're looking at the performance of those active buyers on a go-forward basis and we're pretty pleased with that performance. And then the last thing I'd say is that, look, a lot of the stuff that we're doing on the core strategy is really about the long-term growth. So we're going to see things in the short-term variances versus prior year. But I think for me the core thing is the playbook that we put in place is working. This thesis of really changing the growth trajectory of the category by investing in the playbook is what the team is focused on. And we're going to stay on that for the near to medium future. If I look at coming into this in 2019, we were I think declining 2% from a GMV perspective. And if you look at our revenue growth projected next quarter, we're looking at double-digit revenue growth. So we feel good about where we're positioned coming out of the pandemic. Yes. So first on the payment side, I would say, yes, not only buyers now have more choices of how to pay including Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit card, debit, PayPal, et cetera. But you no longer have to set up two different accounts. You no longer have to manage a claims process or returns process in two different areas. It's one eBay money back guarantee. So to us it dramatically simplifies the whole experience for a buyer and makes it easier. They keep that payment on file and it's just a dramatically easier experience. And then it's helping the seller too because I mentioned the unpaid item example earlier on the call but also the ability for them to manage all their business in one place makes it much more streamlined to just run a business on eBay. On the Promoted Listings, we see opportunities really across every category and every price point of GMV. The beauty of the CPA model that we've had of the cost per acquisition model has been just the simplicity of it of just adding the percentage and it makes it really easy. But the PC model that we're launching also gives the opportunity to really kind of push volume in a different way with a different set of capabilities. But even on single and unique items, people want to promote those items and get more exposure for them. They have for the longest period of time. It's why we're launching the ad feature for auction and testing that is to really go after it. And it's still not -- we still have a lot of opportunity across our listings to increase the penetration. Like I said before, we're only at 1% of GMV. Yes. I'll take the first one and I'll let Andy take the second. So on the category piece, we talked about last year was, people started by panic buying everything that was related to kind of health needs across the board on eBay. And then we saw that expand into kind of stay-at-home categories, fitness and laptops, those types of things in our electronics business. And then, really went kind of across the board over the course of the year. So as you think about this year it's really just a change against the backdrop of what we were buying last year. I'll let Andy take the second part of that. Yes. So the first thing I'd say is that, on the category piece, in some cases the categories have overlapped in terms of features or capabilities we need to build in order to make that a winning NPS for us. So we build authentication once. It took us a couple of months to build it out, but then we're able to roll it out to the next category in a couple of weeks and expand that geographically. And so, I think that's actually true for a lot of areas, where there's components or features that we're building specifically to drive the NPS of a category that will be applicable to a broad set of categories across the experience. And in terms of pace, we're going to continue to do what we've done before, which is, roll them out in a specific geography, make sure that we're seeing the intended impact and then roll it out across the board. We don't really want to talk about which category is next and what we're focused on for competitive reasons. But I would just say that, we're really pleased with the playbook. We're really pleased that we're able to drive significant growth and a significant change in trajectory and most importantly, a significant change in the customer experience. And so, you're just going to see us continue feature after feature, category after category. The second thing I'd say is that the verticals is not the only investment that we're making. A lot of our investment is going to site-wide investments that impact all categories. Clearly, that's true for payments and advertising, but the same is true across our seller tools, across our API business, across the CRM and couponing capabilities that we just rolled out, investments that we have in search and in SEO, which apply to the whole business. So the way I think about them is kind of, a good amount of investment in vertical to really change the NPS of those categories, but a significant amount of site-wide investments as well, which lifts all categories. So that's the strategy. That's how we think about it and we're really pleased with the performance."

You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of February 22, 2023, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year of consistent execution for eBay, as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories drove underlying growth in our business, as we expanded global coverage for our 16 million Enthusiast Buyers. In motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, growth accelerated as we improved our fitting capabilities, increased supply of OEM parts and enhanced trust signals for buyers. We extended authentication to new categories like trading cards and fine jewelry and opened authentication centers in several new countries for handbags. We opened the Vault to store and usually transact valuable items and adoption has grown steadily week over week. We retired legacy technology, simplified the architecture of our core services and improved our tech velocity. Our advertising growth accelerated as we scaled our three newer Promoted Listings products, optimize performance and automated more elements of campaigns. We expanded our financial services portfolio by adding FX conversion, new forms of payments like Klarna and Afterpay, faster debit card payouts and a digital wallet. And we balanced our investments in innovation with prudent cost discipline to establish a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth for many years to come. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics came in ahead of expectations despite the ongoing macro uncertainty. We generated over $18 billion in GMV and more than $2.5 billion in revenue. We delivered an operating margin of close to 30%, while making critical investments in product and marketing to support our long-term growth strategy. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07, up 2% year-over-year. Our focused category strategy was a major component of our strong financial performance during the fourth quarter. Focus categories grew more than 7 points faster than the rest of our marketplace during Q4, which was 2 points faster than the prior quarter. Establishing a game changing level of trust between sellers and buyers has been an important driver of the momentum in our focus categories. Authenticity Guarantee enables trust in our luxury categories like watches, sneakers, handbags and fine jewelry. We have observed notable turnarounds in GMV growth since we launched authentication, improved the product experience and grew awareness to the great inventory in these categories. In aggregate, our luxury focused categories have grown at roughly double-digit CAGR since Q4 of 2019, proving these investments have been highly effective. We dramatically improved trust in our refurbished offering by introducing warranties and half of returns, which attracted more brand and new categories to our marketplace. Those investments paid dividends in Q4 and with positive year-over-year GMV growth and the biggest sales week ever for refurbished goods during Cyber Week. Trust in our motors, parts and accessories category is most reliant on equipement for ensuring the compatibility of auto parts with a specific vehicle. During the last few months, we have taken major steps forward with our fitment capabilities. We acquired myFitment in Q3 to help sellers populate their listings with accurate fitment data, which ensures compatibility for buyers. In Q4, we began making myFitment's technology accessible to all buyers, starting with a pilot group of P&A sellers. Listings enhanced by this technology are seeing a measurable uplift in conversion, and we will expand this program further in 2023. Our significant investments in fitment over the past few years allowed us to launch a prominent Fit Your Vehicle badge in Q4. Similar to the Authenticity Guaranteed logo, we show on luxury goods, this badge provides a clear indication of which parts fit your vehicle throughout the buyer journey across search, merchandising, view item and checkout. This is no small feat with over 500 million active P&A listings on eBay and the increasing complexity of vehicles in the marketplace. These advancements have significantly elevated our capabilities for P&A shoppers, and I'm pleased to share a new program we launched just last week called eBay Guaranteed Fit. This program is the breakthrough for trust and P&A that Authenticity Guarantee is in luxury and warranties are for eBay refurbished. It provides buyers with assurance that eBay will stand behind them if a part doesn't fit their vehicle. Guaranteed Fit is a huge milestone for the P&A category and the culmination of our multiyear fitment journey. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for executing the foundational work, making this program possible and I'm looking forward to seeing their continued innovation in the category. I'm also excited about our team's work in collectibles, which has benefited from a steady cadence of product development and partnerships, including most recently, our live commerce beta. During Q4, we scaled up a number of eBay live events with select sellers, bringing a healthy level of viewers, engagement and GMV to participating sellers. We also introduced the eBay Live Hub, where users can subscribe to channels and receive notifications about future events. This hub will serve as a central discovery point as we broaden the availability of live commerce to more sellers and categories this year. Our acquisition of TCGplayer has also greatly enhanced our collectibles category. And in Q4, we began developing synergies between our respective marketplaces. In addition to its customer base of nearly 800,000 hobbyists, a major competitive advantage for TCGplayer is its relationship with thousands of local brick-and-mortar hobby shops with many subscribing to its point of sale and channel management solution. Due to this software, sellers can now more easily streamline listings and inventory on both TCGplayer and eBay. TCGplayer also further diversified its marketplace by introducing Comex during Q4, which is a natural adjacency to collectible card games. eBay's historical sales data enabled TCGplayer to launch Comex with robust pricing intelligence, which will help us scale this offering. While our integration is in its early days, I'm incredibly excited to see what TCGplayer community will bring to eBay over time. One of the key pillars of our strategy is being the platform of choice for sellers. eBay's scale and global footprint represent key advantages for our platform as we work toward achieving this vision. In 2022, roughly one-fifth of our GMV was facilitated through cross-border trade. Sellers who activate their listings internationally can reach buyers in over 200 countries globally. However, less than half of the inventory in our top three markets is currently available for export due to the friction associated with these transactions. To unlock more valuable inventory for global buyers, last fall, we announced a major revamp of our cross-border capabilities with the launch of eBay International Shipping. Under this program, eBay handles any customs forms, coordinates duties with buyers, and intermediates returns. Sellers are protected from item not received complaints, while buyers benefit from greater selection and lower shipping costs. The program is resonating well as we gradually ramp enrollment for sellers, while buyer satisfaction on eBay International Shipping transactions reached 80%. Steve will discuss the financial implications of this program, and I'm confident it will increase cross-border inventory and drive incremental GMV for eBay. Investments in AI are also improving customer perception of our shipping capabilities. In Q4, we deployed a new machine learning model for estimated delivery date in the U.S. and select international markets, enabling us to make more accurate delivery predictions to buyers. Applying this model in the US reduced the average delivery estimate by one and a half days for all domestic listings, resulting in a noticeable uplift in conversion. A separate model deployed for eligible Authenticity Guarantee products resulted in an average reduction of approximately two days for US listings. These rollouts are just the latest example of our ability to leverage AI to make our existing processes more efficient, which will be a continued focus for us in 2023 and beyond. Moving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4 despite headwinds in the broader digital ad market. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue of $276 million, up 27% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth. Over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q4 and we eclipsed $700 million live voted listings. Additionally, our total ad revenue is nearing 1.8% penetration of GMV. Promoted Listing Standard was again the largest contributor to growth, both on a sequential and an annual basis as optimization gains from prior quarters continue to benefit ad rates. In Q4, we also improved our merchandising algorithms to show a greater diversity of products, which improves buyer satisfaction, while also preserving relevance and conversion. Our newer ad products also continued to scale nicely in Q4 and grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click product continues to be a standout among the new products. Seller adoption of Advanced has grown, as we have expanded access and automated more elements of campaign management to make this powerful ad unit easier to use. In Q4, we launched Quick Setup, a one-click campaign creation solution for sellers, where eBay automates and optimizes the campaign structure, ad groups targeting and keyword bids for CPC advertisers. We also introduced multiuser account access across our full suite of promoted listings, which enables eBay sellers to delegate campaign management to trusted third parties like brands or ad agencies. Turning to payments. We continue to roll out additional payment services to support high ASP transactions and improve fire conversion. During Q4, we introduced split payments in the US for transactions over $1,000, enabling buyers to spread large purchases across two credit cards. We've already processed transactions from thousands of buyers at an average order value of over $3,000, and we're excited to expand this offering globally later this year to better support our focus categories. Additionally, building on the success of Afterpay, we recently partnered with Zip to introduce a suite of buy now pay later options to our Australian buyers. Zip supports purchases of up to $10,000, extending our ASP coverage in this valuable market. By managing our end-to-end payments process, we are also able to leverage our own proprietary risk models to assess transaction requests across our marketplace. Last year, our risk and protection team without enhanced controls that allowed us to approve transactions that may have otherwise been declined in the past, enabling over $0.5 billion of annualized GMV and reducing potential escalations to customer service. In connection with risk management, we continue to invest in the security of our marketplace to ensure our capabilities remain world-class. Last week, we announced the acquisition of 3PM Shield, a provider of state-of-the-art marketplace compliance tool. 3PM Shield offers effective solutions for the prevention and identification of counterfeit listings and prohibited items. Combining this technology with our proprietary data, will further enhance the integrity of our marketplace. Before we move on, I'd like to touch on the actions we've taken to sharpen our focus as a company and run our business more efficiently, particularly in light of the uncertain economic environment. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 500 jobs or roughly 4% of our global employee base. This decision followed a thoughtful review of our organization to ensure our people and roles were aligned with priorities that advance eBay's commitment to long-term sustainable growth. These changes provide additional flexibility for us to invest efficiently and create new roles in high potential areas of our business like new technologies, trusted customer experiences and key markets. There is no easy way to say goodbye to our talented colleagues, their passion and accomplishments over the last few years have helped us get us to where we are today. We are incredibly thankful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this difficult transition. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones from our ESG efforts last year, starting with e-commerce. In 2022, our marketplace generated $4.6 billion in positive economic impact through the sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions and kept 73,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. E-commerce continues to provide significant economic benefit for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. And buying pre-loved items shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, just yesterday, we published our third annual e-commerce report, which found that 90% of surveyed respondents engaged in e-commerce during 2022. Cost savings were the most popular motivator for buying pre-loved especially among Gen Z buyers. 64% of whom said its financial savings as a primary reason for shopping e-commerce and sustainability was the second most important factor with people increasingly turning to pre-loved to help the environment. This positions us well as we continue to pave the way as an industry leader enabling economic empowerment and sustainability through our platform. Now, let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. In Q4, eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $35 million. And for the year, customers raised over $163 million. This represents an all-time high in fund raised through eBay for Charity, since we started this program 20 years ago. The eBay Foundation granted nearly $23 million in 2022, primarily to non-profit organizations advancing, inclusive entrepreneurship and through our employee matching gift programs. This represents another all-time high for annual foundation grants. I am fortunate to lead a purpose-driven company with a team dedicated to helping communities around the world, while protecting our planet. For the fourth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. We were also included on CDP's A List for 2022, which recognizes companies that are leading the way in environmental transparency and performance on climate change. Additionally, eBay ranks number one on cross-border commerce Europe's list of the top sustainable marketplaces operating in Europe. Looking to 2023, I'm incredibly excited about the road map ahead of us. Today, I'll offer just a glimpse of a few areas where you should expect to see progress from us this year. We'll continue to innovate for customers in our focus categories and extend to new countries and categories this year. We will continue our work in P&A by expanding the guaranteed FIT program and fifth-year vehicle badge globally. We'll also grow our tire installation capabilities after we began improving the end-to-end tire shopping experience and broaden our network of installation partners in five markets during Q4. We'll ramp assets in the vault and extend eligibility for more collectible items. While integrations with TCG player and known Origin will strengthen our value proposition for collectors. We will also continue to iterate next-gen shopping features like live commerce to better engage with enthusiasts. And we will further develop the category landing pages we debut for sneakers, watches and handbags in Q4, which offer trending inventory and personalized recommendations, powered by machine learning. Sellers across our marketplace will benefit from the expansion of our international shipping program to more markets, which will drive incremental GMV as sellers tap into our global demand. We will continue to scale our advertising offering as we track toward our next $1 billion by 2025, and \u2013 we'll simplify and grow adoption of float listings advance, deliver more AI-driven optimization and further expand our ads portfolio. Finally, just as we have done in focus categories, this year, we will adapt our one-size-fits-all approach, to build more relevant and compelling localized experiences in some of our European markets. We will enhance local discoverability, reduce friction through simplified selling experiences, offer new local forms of payment and address other market-specific experience gaps in search, language and return policies. In closing, I would like to thank our extraordinary eBay employees for their accomplishments this year. Their unrelenting focus on serving our community has supported our sellers and buyers during these challenging economic times. I'm confident that with our talented eBay team, our strategic vision and a persistent focus on operational excellence we will continue to develop compelling experiences for customers and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the fourth quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and some additional color on 2020 fit before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations and landed near the high end or above our expected guidance at Aegis. Gross merchandise volume declined 6% to $18.2 billion, while FX was a 6-point headwind to reported growth. Revenue was down 1% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points, primarily due to FX and robust growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 1.8 points due to volume deleverage and continued investment at the marketing to support the strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 2% year-over-year, and we generated $533 million of free cash flow, up 43% year-over-year, while returning $419 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results demonstrate the continued resilience of our marketplace amid economic uncertainty. I'm extremely proud of our teams delivering on their quarterly financial commitments, maintaining prudent cost discipline and executing key deliverables in support of our long-term growth objectives. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume is down 6% year-over-year, decelerating roughly 1 point sequentially. Our business remains resilient despite headwinds from geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, low consumer confidence and rising interest rates. Additionally, FX was a headwind of approximately 6 points of GMV roughly 0.5 point greater than Q3. Momentum in focused categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business. In aggregate, focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year during Q4, roughly two points faster than the prior quarter delta. Motus Parts accessories growth accelerated sequentially and remain the largest contributor to this outperformance. And we are excited to see what recent rollouts like fix you vehicle badge and Guaranteed Fit program will do for momentum in this category. Refurbished goods also contributed positively to growth in Q4, as we continue to expand to new brands and categories. We've also made the onboarding process for third-party sellers more scalable to increase the breadth and depth of refurbished selection on our marketplace. Within our luxury and trading cards categories, we continue to see healthy trends in authenticated item transactions in Q4, which has mitigated the macro driven ASP pressure observed across these industries in recent months. As you'll recall, we closed the acquisition of TCGplayer at the end of October. A partial quarter of GMV revenue and expenses are included in our financials for Q4. But based on the timing of the deal close, TCGplayer's contribution is not material to results. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. Our US GMV declined 9% year-over-year decelerating by roughly two points versus the prior quarter. International GMV declined 4% on an FX neutral basis, which was stable sequentially. Compared to Q4 of 2019, our total marketplace grew 2%, a deceleration from 6% last quarter versus 2019, US GMV rose 12% in Q4 while international GMV was down 5%. Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focused category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4. Moving to active buyers. 134 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months. We had 132 million active buyers, excluding our TCGplayer acquisition and bias from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down roughly $1 million sequentially as a gradual improvement in buyer reactivation over the past few quarters has led to modest stabilization in our active buyer counts. Enthusiast buyers accounted for over 16 million of our active buyers in Q4, less than $0.5 million sequentially from churn within enthusiasts remains de minimis. The net downward migration of enthusiast is the mid-value group was also the lowest we observed since we began disclosing these buyer groups as lapping pressure has eased in recent quarters. Average spend per enthusiast rose again sequentially and continue to be healthy at above $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. You'll notice in our Q4 earnings release and upcoming 10-K that we are now presenting a single net revenues line, which better aligns our reporting with how our business is operated. We provided one final quarter of marketing services and other revenue in slide 12 of our earnings presentation. Today, I'm moving forward when we r efer to take rate, we will be referencing our all-in net revenue divided by GMV. Net revenue was down 1% to over $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter, one point acceleration versus Q3. Our take rate was 13.8% in Q4 at roughly 40 basis points sequentially. Although FX hedge gains were the most significant driver of our sequential take rate increased in Q4, we continue to see healthy contributions in both advertising and payments revenue. Our advertising business continues to build momentum. Total ad revenue grew 19% during the quarter. Our first-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the second straight quarter. This extraordinary result was primarily driven by optimization and performance improvements in our standard promoted listings product. Healthy growth in our newer products, most notably our cost per click as also contributed meaningfully. Our legacy third-party display ads were weaker in Q4 due to industry-wide headwinds over the Holloway, but these ads represent an increasingly smaller portion of our mix. Managed payments contributed nearly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate expansion driven by new financial service offerings. These include buyer and seller FX conversion that facilitates cross-border trade, faster debit card payouts, and new high SP transaction services supporting our luxury categories. Importantly, both advertising and payments remain on track to meet our multiyear revenue targets we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9% in Q4, up nearly one point sequentially but down 1.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were down modestly year-over-year due to volume deleverage and authentication costs, partly offset by lower payment processing fees. Sales and marketing rose by over one point as a percentage of revenue as we invested in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories, while product development was relatively flat as some one-time impacts offset continued hiring of technical talent. Our G&A expense rise as a percentage of revenue due to charitable contributions and other one-time items. In Q4, we recognized a GAAP charge within G&A expense of $50 million related to pending legal matters. You'll see these adjustments including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Additional details on this accrual will be provided in our upcoming Form 10-K. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, up 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a 12% reduction in share count from our share repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, with the delta being driven by a recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 43% to $533 million in Q4, driven primarily by the lapping of cash tax payments on investment sales in the prior year. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.9 billion and gross debt of $8.9 billion, following a successful $1.2 billion debt raise in November. We repurchased roughly $300 million of shares at an average price of approximately $42 during Q4 and have over $2.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $119 million in December or $0.22 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments were valued at approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the sale of a de minimis number of shares in December to satisfy regulatory requirements, our $404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Our Adyen investment value is calculated based on the probability of our remaining warrant tranche successful. In addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2022, we continue to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our strategic objectives by our Build By Partner framework. We closed the acquisition of 3PM Shield last week, which will strengthen trust in our marketplace, they're helping us prevent and detect problematic listings with even greater precision. Moving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we forecast GMV between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 4% year-over-year. This GMV outlook includes an estimated $100 million from one-time benefits already recognized in Q1 and anticipate an FX headwind to reported growth between two and three points. We expect to generate revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.5 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year. We anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin between 29.1% and 29.7%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.09 and representing EPS growth between flat and up 3% year-over-year. Although, we are not providing full year guidance at this time, given the dynamic operating environment, we will share some directional color on how we are currently thinking about 2023. Our baseline expectation is that the external demand environment does not materially improve during the first half of the year, as a result of continued macro uncertainty across our largest markets. While we do see potential for an improvement in underlying economic conditions as the year progresses, it is too early to predict the second half recovery, buying out with confidence. As a result, we currently expect our sequential GMV growth beyond Q1 to roughly approximately seasonality we observed during 2022, excluding the impact of currency. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year on a spot basis, as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives in 2023. This forecast contemplates one-time impacts to our P&L from recent M&A and the rollout of the eBay International Shipping program this year. These one-time factors combined are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind for operating margin of approximately 120 basis points versus 2022. Our expense growth forecast is also net of roughly $100 million of OpEx savings from our structural cost program as we continue to look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. I'd like to share some additional context on the one-time impact to margin. Over the past year, we accelerated our progress towards several core strategic objectives through the acquisitions of TCGplayer, KnownOrigin, myFitment, and 3PM Shield. While we are excited about the synergies and long-term growth potential of these assets, lowering them into a scale in the marketplace with our level of profitability does present a natural drag on margins in the short-term, which will diminish as our integration work progresses. The rollout of eBay International Shipping will improve seller velocity and global availability of unique inventory over the long run. Our role in intermediating shipping and returns in this program will shift us to principal relationship with sellers versus being an agency in our previous global shipping program. From an accounting perspective, this means revenue from the new program will be recognized on a gross basis, while the vast majority of expenses are variable and recognize the cost of revenue, while the operating margin headwind from this program will abate as we progressively scale it through 2023. It's primarily variable costs or impact to our reported gross margins. We expect this program to generate incremental operating profit this year despite representing a headwind of 30 basis points of gross margin in Q1, rising to 120 basis points in Q4. Additionally, we expect foreign exchange to represent a headwind of approximately 1% of GMV in 2023 and between 3% to 4% to non-GAAP EPS, following the unwinding of recent US dollar strength. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. On the capital allocation front, I'm pleased to announce our Board recently approved a 14% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising to $0.25 per share in 2023. We continue to target returning approximately 125% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2022 and 2024, and our broader capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our fortress balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage in this environment that enables us to invest organically in our business, accelerate our strategic objectives with disciplined inorganic investments, while still delivering healthy capital return to shareholders. In the current macro environment, we believe it is prudent to balance the timing and magnitude of share repurchases with our capital needs from quarter-to-quarter. Our first priority is offsetting dilution, and we expect to be opportunistic with regard to larger repurchases. In closing, our Q4 results capped off a resilient year for eBay in 2022 as we made meaningful progress towards our long-term strategy, despite significant macro uncertainty. We exceeded consensus expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS during Q4. Our focused categories continue to outperform and are driving underlying growth in our business. Our advertising revenue continues to meaningfully outpace volume growth, while payment initiatives continue to scale in line with expectations. We achieved a full year operating margin of 30% despite contending with a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We generated nearly $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, equating to nearly 170% of our free cash flow. I'm proud that eBay continues to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment and sustainability to our platform. We once again achieved carbon neutrality in 2022 and remain committed to reducing 90% of our carbon emissions from our operations by 2030. I'm incredibly appreciative of our team's focus and execution during 2022, as we delivered on a number of our core strategic objectives, despite navigating uncertain macro environment. I'm confident our investments in 2022 enabled us to exit the year stronger than when we entered it, keeping us on a path to sustainable long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions for me. Maybe, Jamie, at a high level, first off, you seem generally satisfied with the strategic focus on enthusiast buyers and the non-new-in-season segment that you outlined a year ago. But I wonder, if you could talk about any ways in which you'd say this strategy has evolved through the year as you plan for the next couple of years? Some of that may be more nuanced, but curious on your views there. And then, Steve, I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the 2023 outlook. I think we understand the GMV perspective and some of the margin impacts. On the take rate, should we assume that, that gap between GMV and revenue growth continues to grow, given the increasing contribution of advertising and payments through the year? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first on the kind of where we are, we're pleased with the progress that we're seeing. So if you think about focused categories outgrowing the rest of the business by 7 points, the double-digit change that we've seen in customer satisfaction, we took on our largest focus category at the end of last year with parts and accessories, and we're seeing that return to market share growth, which is great. It's a very large business. We outlined that at Investor Day being over $10 billion. And the shift that we made to non-new-in-season, I think, is really helping us, especially in these challenging economic times. All the work we did and refurbished to build that as a strong category on eBay. Now we're seeing -- we had our largest week ever during Cyber Week. And during challenging economic times, people really turn to value. And I think we're leaning into where the consumer is headed. I'd point you to the re-commerce Report, which we put out yesterday, which said 90% of the respondents bought re-commerce in 2022 and Gen Z, 64% of them said it was because of the financial value that's provided. So, we think we're right in there. We're going to continue to enhance and build on that strategy. We're doing a lot of additional work in artificial intelligence and bringing that not only to our focused categories, but also to our horizontal businesses. I talk about the work that we did in search as one example of that, the work that we did in advertising with the merchandising there as a second one. And then you see us continuing to expand what we're doing on the horizontal side. I'd just end with eBay International Shipping. Cross-border trade is now one in five transactions on eBay. It's one of the unique value propositions that we have, especially for the individual consumer. And we're making that a whole lot easier with what we're doing with eBay International Shipping, and that's another kind of huge opportunity across the board on the horizontal side. So over the course of the year, I'll get into more and more details about it, but we feel really good about the vector that we're on. Steve, do you want to take the second part?\nSteve Priest: Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Colin. With regard to as payments, versus say is really pleased with the execution from the teams did a tremendous job and we're tracking well towards the direction that we gave at Investor Day in terms of our medium-term targets, in terms of payments and ads. We don't give any specific guidance on the call associated with that in payments for '23, but you should expect them to continue to outpace GMV, as they did in 2022. So, great execution from the teams and pleased with where we are.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Hey good afternoon, guys. Steve, maybe a quick one for you. Could you please talk about the GMV growth you've seen internationally, it looks like international FX-neutral exceeded domestic for the second quarter in a row. And I'm just curious, if you're kind of surprised by that result. I think you referenced P&A and maybe luxury driving that. And then curious that the $100 million benefit, I believe, to GMV in the guidance. I think there was some reference to that in the guidance. Maybe, Jamie, just a quick one for you, if I could, can you just talk about authenticity and how you feel like you are executing and whether you've turned a corner there. I think most of the recent acquisitions have been centered around authenticity and removing fake goods. How do you feel about your progress there? And how much further do you need to go? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Tom, I'll pick up the first one. Obviously, we're seeing different dynamics based on our international business and the U.S. business based on the macro environment - the dynamic macro environment that we've been operating in. And obviously, some of those challenges were more pronounced than the international business earlier than the U.S., and we called out some color with regards to that as we guided the fourth quarter actually in terms of some of the U.S. softness that we saw in October coming through that. The thing I would say is that, the execution our own focused categories, both in Europe and the U.S. is seeing underlying momentum P&A, for example, we're number one in a couple of the key markets in Europe, in the UK and Germany; and number two in the U.S. and things like P&A, luxury, refurb are seeing good momentum both internationally and in the U.S. Specifically, pertaining to the $100 million that we laid out in the prepared comments, this is a specific GMV benefit as a one-time item in Q1, which we do not expect to continue through the year. It's most notably around Chinese sellers, keeping their stores open through the Lunar New Year, which is not typical for this time of year. Jamie over to you?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Tom. So on authenticity, we're feeling great about what we're seeing in terms of the impact that it's having on customer satisfaction and the execution of it. If you think about it for those focused categories like luxury handbag, sneakers, watches, authenticity is what provides the game-changing level of trust. That's different in other categories. So in refurbish, for example, it's the two-year warranties and the 30-day hassle-free returns. And then something like P&A, we just launched this week Guaranteed Fit, which is really the game-changing level of trust, which is guaranteeing that, that part is going to fit your product, which is really key. The acquisition that we did recently with 3PM Shield, it's really a state-of-the-art market compliance capability that they've built using really advanced AI technologies to help keep prohibited items off the platform. And that's really just continuing the theme of building trust on the marketplace, and eBay as a trusted place to shop, which has paid massive dividends, giving us a great ROI from the investments that we've made to-date, and we feel really good about the progress and where we are.\nTom Champion: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nNikhil Devnani: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I had a couple on GMV growth, please. Steve, you mentioned that U.S. softness that you called out in October, did that persist, or did you see any kind of changes in trends there better or worse? And then in terms of the 2023 growth framework, thanks for that, but is \u201822 the right year to use for seasonality given Omicron and just post-COVID dynamics it feels like you started the year well. Just wondering why GMV would step down in Q2, Q3, especially as you invest in the marketplace as well to make it better? Thanks a lot.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Nikhil, thank you for the questions. First of all, with regards to the fourth quarter and coming in, as we said in our prepared comments, really pleased to see some of the execution particularly in a couple of key focus categories like P&A and refurb continue to sort of be highlights for the fourth quarter as we came through it. As we've mentioned, came through towards the top end of the guide. And really, we did have less headwind as we'd expected on an exchange rate basis, with the US dollars we went through. But some core strength in a couple of the focus categories as we come through the fourth quarter. With regards to the sequencing, we're dealing with an incredibly dynamic macro environment and we wanted to give some color for the investor community as we start to think about 2023. And obviously, the macro dynamic has been challenged during 2022. And so in that directional color, we've given a comprehensive guide for the first quarter. We continue to execute in the underlying business. But based on the uncertainty that we are facing at the moment and the continuation of that macro challenge we felt it was most prudent just to sort of lay out that sequencing relating to 2023.\nNikhil Devnani: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up to that GMV sequencing answer on that last one. So it doesn't sound like you really ascribe to the theory that consumers may shift some wallet share away from services and back to goods in 2023, which is kind of the opposite of what happened in 2022. So any comment on that? And then I guess, just what would it take to get back to that GMV framework that you laid out at Analyst Day. Is there anything else in your control that you can see to get those GMV growth rates up to the mid-singles? And then the second question is just we're seeing a lot of inflation around the world, different rates in different countries. You guys have a lot of cross-border corridor. So how is lower inflation in the US potentially than places like the UK and Germany impacting your business as far as the cross-border? Thanks a lot.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Ross, I'll take those. So with regard to the GMV sequencing, we haven't guided the full year. We're just trying to give some directional alignment. We're just trying to plan our business effectively around the dynamic macro environment that we're seeing. Again, put a very comprehensive guide up for the first quarter, really pleased with the execution of the strategy, which is working well and leaning into the focus categories that we're still to execute. We mentioned the fact that we do see as many commentators say, a very, very challenged and certain first half of the year. Again, we're just given some direction on alignment about how we think about things as we navigate through 2023. So just providing some color accordingly. With regards to the Investor Day GMV framework, we're leaning in exactly where we said we would, whether it's luxury, whether it's P&A, Jamie talked extensively about the benefits of authentication impacting the business. And so we are seeing underlying positive growth in our business as we execute the strategy, continue to be fueled by the momentum that we're seeing with payments and ads. In terms of the timing of the GMV framework that we laid out at Investor Day, that's really a function of the potential severity and duration of the macro environment that we're operating in, which will obviously have an indication in terms of the timing of when we get to those longer-term targets. And then finally, with regards to inflation, as you imagine, inflation is impacting a number of our businesses across the US and in Europe. Europe has been more pronounced over recent quarters because of -- particularly because of the energy challenges as we go forward. And in addition, you've got some labor pressure being impacted in Europe as well that's impacting the business. Specifically, around eBay, we do have a resilient business, but however, general inflation does have a, I suppose, a mixed impact on our business because we lead into non-new-in-season items, that really just helped impact where consumers are looking for value, and we have a lot of pre-loved and refurbished items on our platform and that performance in Q4 was a great reflection of that. However, because of the macro challenges, we're not immune to the inflationary pressures on the discretionary consumer spending. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color in terms of how we think about the business.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Thank you. So, Jamie, I think we spent quite a bit of time talking through the re-commerce opportunity on this call. Now, given eBay's history with cataloging, I have to think that having increased parameters on how gently or not gently used the same item may be and how that's described from seller-to-seller, that's probably creating a unique sorting problem. So, can you talk about how you are tapping the opportunity and ultimately, sort of the correct results to the user?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Stephen, I basically would just point you, for example, the parts and accessories, right? What we're doing there is using our knowledge around fitments and all the investments that we've made over the last couple of quarters and being able to say, if you're looking on the site in parts and accessories, you're going to see these big green check marks, let's say, Fits Your Vehicle. And now with what we've released just last week, we're actually going to say it's guaranteed to fit. Think about that as like authenticity guarantee for vehicles. So, we're continuing to category-by-category, find the best way to improve that search experience. And something like refurbished it's certifying the quality of that refurbishment and saying we're going to stand behind that with a 30-day hassle-free return eBay Money-Back Guarantees. So, the combination of the great work that our search team does with AI to really drive more relevance on the platform drive better recall in our search results, et cetera, combined with the category-specific work that we're doing to really optimize that experience on a category-by-category basis, is really the intersection of those two. It's what's working out, I think, so well for us and why we're seeing strong numbers in the strategy and in the focused categories that we've rolled out.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thanks so much. I just want to shift gears and ask about expenses, Steve, and the 2% growth in non-GAAP expenses and in 2023. If you could just talk about some of the key investments here and puts and takes? And I guess, in particular, how we should be thinking about sales and marketing, assuming that you'll continue to do full funnel margin on the focus categories? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Good afternoon, Doug. I think at a macro level, I would say that we will continue, as we always have been to lean into the short-term to drive operational efficiencies through the likes of the structured cost program where we're going very deep on the organization, while at the same time continue to invest for the future for the long-term trajectory and growth of the business. In terms of the investments we'll be making in 2023 is continue the strategic playbook. It's continuing to invest in product that customers want to continue to invest in trust on the platform and then continue to invest in full funnel marketing in terms of making sure that we get the communication matters out to our customers. The 2% increase in year-over-year non-GAAP expense growth includes the 120 basis points of margin headwinds that we talked about associated with M&A and the eBay International Shipping program, and it's net of $100 million of the structural cost program that we've laid out. So if I stand back, we've got a couple of headwinds with those two items I've talked about. We're leaning in to drive cost efficiencies, and we're continuing to invest for the future long-term sustainability of the business.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So first, can you give us some color on the growth in focus categories where you've had the user experience enhancements for a while now, specifically, sneakers and luxury watches and some of those categories. I understand that macro is volatile, but are you seeing sustained share gains in these categories now? Any additional color on recent growth there would be great. And then, Steve, can you unpack the 2023 EPS guide for us for a little bit? Clearly, we recognize that there's a lot of uncertainties. But how should we think about the magnitude and cadence of buybacks for this year? And maybe is it fair to use 2022 seasonality also as a proxy for quarterly cadence on EPS as well?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So -- hi, Deepak, let me take the first one. So yeah, we're really pleased with what we're seeing with focused categories. It's growing seven points faster than the rest of the platform. The way to think about that is plus 2% if you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. When you look at our coverage, we're at about 25% across the whole business. If you look at our big three markets where we've been focusing, it's about 28% coverage, so making nice progress there. But it's not just about investing in new coverage. It's also about investing in existing categories that are driving the underlying growth in our business and balancing reinvestment there. And we're really pleased. We continue to invest in sneakers, we launched two years ago, but we're continuing to invest with manage shipping, which we launched in 2022. We talked on the call about luxury goods having roughly double-digit growth rates over the past couple of years. So we are seeing that market share -- return to market share growth for those businesses, which is really healthy. And I'd say the largest one of which is P&A, and we're really excited by the progress that we're seeing in P&A. On the product side, the work we're doing in fitment and Guaranteed Fit and making the catalog available via the apps. The new acquisition with myFitment, further increasing our ability to do there, combined with the marketing that we're doing in the US, we're doing the actual personalities from car talk in the UK were associated with Pimp My Ride. So we're really going after that enthusiast buyer, and it's really working. So I'm really pleased with the performance on focus categories. Steve, maybe you want to take the second part?\nSteve Priest: Yes. So Deepak, we've obviously gotten a very comprehensive Q1 guide. And as I mentioned earlier, because of the uncertainty still the dynamic macro environment, we've not given a full year guide at this point. With regard to the seasonality question that you had, that pertains to directional color associated with GMV. And so that's how I would sort of locate that. Specifically thinking about capital returns that we've laid out, just sort of taking a step back, in 2022, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which is 170% of free cash flow. As you're thinking about capital returns, we remain committed to the 125% of free cash flow target that we laid out at the investor event between 2022 and 2024. So we're sort of tracking above that. And as I think about 2023, our priority really to start with is going to be to be committed to offsetting dilution in terms of the such share count, while continuing to balance the capital needs of the business. We have lent in and done a 14% increase in the dividend from $0.22 to $0.25. But for me, our fortress balance sheet continues to be a key competitive advantage in this environment to enable us to continue to invest in the business. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color about how we're thinking about 2023.\nJohn Egbert : Operator, can we do one last question, please?\nOperator: Your final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions, please. This advertising continued ramp penetration now to 1.8% of GMV. As you've looked at third-party data points and maybe as you've looked at that penetration within verticals, do you have a better sense of how high that penetration can rise overall? And then secondly, just talk a little bit about you had the step up in focused category marketing spend and just your confidence level that you're getting a good return on that. There's a clear deleverage in the model, but there's a lot of noise in there. So just how do you look at that and the proof that that's actually working out for you? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone : Yes. Thanks, Mark. So on the ad side, like we said at Investor Day, we have line of sight to 3%, which we still feel great about. If you look at the performance, Promoted Listing Standard continues to be the workhorse of the product, and we're continuing to drive additional penetration there, hitting 2 million sellers and 700 million listings. But we're also excited by our new products. They once again grew 20% quarter-over-quarter and we're making it easier for sellers. I talked about Quick Setup, which makes it much easier to come into the program and use the program. And then we're working on things like multi-user access, which we just launched which enables more flexibility to actually bring in an ad agency to help you manage your ad campaigns. So I feel great about the potential there, growing 30-plus percent over volume and what we're seeing. On the focused category side, been really happy with the performance of the marketing spend. If you think about it, we've shifted our model from being really kind of lower funnel optimization to doing more full funnel. And that's driving more enthusiast buyers into the platform, and it's allowing the overall spend to work a little bit harder. But at the same time, it's really allowing us to bring buyers in and then leverage them across multiple categories. So if you think about like a sneaker buyer, they will come in and buy $450 in sneakers, but then they'll buy $1,900 in other products in other categories. A handbag buyer will buy $2,500, but then spend $5,000 elsewhere. So when you look at the return on marketing spend, usually full funnel has a longer return on it, but we think it's the absolute right spend. We're seeing the right change in consideration and we're really driving, I think, the unique value proposition that we have to offer at eBay. So, you're going to continue to see, just like we've done in parts, really specific marketing tailored to those enthusiasts with the right full funnel approach, because we like the performance of what we're seeing.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the fourth quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and some additional color on 2020 fit before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations and landed near the high end or above our expected guidance at Aegis. Gross merchandise volume declined 6% to $18.2 billion, while FX was a 6-point headwind to reported growth. Revenue was down 1% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points, primarily due to FX and robust growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 1.8 points due to volume deleverage and continued investment at the marketing to support the strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 2% year-over-year, and we generated $533 million of free cash flow, up 43% year-over-year, while returning $419 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results demonstrate the continued resilience of our marketplace amid economic uncertainty. I'm extremely proud of our teams delivering on their quarterly financial commitments, maintaining prudent cost discipline and executing key deliverables in support of our long-term growth objectives. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume is down 6% year-over-year, decelerating roughly 1 point sequentially. Our business remains resilient despite headwinds from geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, low consumer confidence and rising interest rates. Additionally, FX was a headwind of approximately 6 points of GMV roughly 0.5 point greater than Q3. Momentum in focused categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business. In aggregate, focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by over 7 points year-over-year during Q4, roughly two points faster than the prior quarter delta. Motus Parts accessories growth accelerated sequentially and remain the largest contributor to this outperformance. And we are excited to see what recent rollouts like fix you vehicle badge and Guaranteed Fit program will do for momentum in this category. Refurbished goods also contributed positively to growth in Q4, as we continue to expand to new brands and categories. We've also made the onboarding process for third-party sellers more scalable to increase the breadth and depth of refurbished selection on our marketplace. Within our luxury and trading cards categories, we continue to see healthy trends in authenticated item transactions in Q4, which has mitigated the macro driven ASP pressure observed across these industries in recent months. As you'll recall, we closed the acquisition of TCGplayer at the end of October. A partial quarter of GMV revenue and expenses are included in our financials for Q4. But based on the timing of the deal close, TCGplayer's contribution is not material to results. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. Our US GMV declined 9% year-over-year decelerating by roughly two points versus the prior quarter. International GMV declined 4% on an FX neutral basis, which was stable sequentially. Compared to Q4 of 2019, our total marketplace grew 2%, a deceleration from 6% last quarter versus 2019, US GMV rose 12% in Q4 while international GMV was down 5%. Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focused category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4. Moving to active buyers. 134 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months. We had 132 million active buyers, excluding our TCGplayer acquisition and bias from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations in July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down roughly $1 million sequentially as a gradual improvement in buyer reactivation over the past few quarters has led to modest stabilization in our active buyer counts. Enthusiast buyers accounted for over 16 million of our active buyers in Q4, less than $0.5 million sequentially from churn within enthusiasts remains de minimis. The net downward migration of enthusiast is the mid-value group was also the lowest we observed since we began disclosing these buyer groups as lapping pressure has eased in recent quarters. Average spend per enthusiast rose again sequentially and continue to be healthy at above $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. You'll notice in our Q4 earnings release and upcoming 10-K that we are now presenting a single net revenues line, which better aligns our reporting with how our business is operated. We provided one final quarter of marketing services and other revenue in slide 12 of our earnings presentation. Today, I'm moving forward when we r efer to take rate, we will be referencing our all-in net revenue divided by GMV. Net revenue was down 1% to over $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter, one point acceleration versus Q3. Our take rate was 13.8% in Q4 at roughly 40 basis points sequentially. Although FX hedge gains were the most significant driver of our sequential take rate increased in Q4, we continue to see healthy contributions in both advertising and payments revenue. Our advertising business continues to build momentum. Total ad revenue grew 19% during the quarter. Our first-party ads grew 27%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the second straight quarter. This extraordinary result was primarily driven by optimization and performance improvements in our standard promoted listings product. Healthy growth in our newer products, most notably our cost per click as also contributed meaningfully. Our legacy third-party display ads were weaker in Q4 due to industry-wide headwinds over the Holloway, but these ads represent an increasingly smaller portion of our mix. Managed payments contributed nearly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate expansion driven by new financial service offerings. These include buyer and seller FX conversion that facilitates cross-border trade, faster debit card payouts, and new high SP transaction services supporting our luxury categories. Importantly, both advertising and payments remain on track to meet our multiyear revenue targets we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9% in Q4, up nearly one point sequentially but down 1.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were down modestly year-over-year due to volume deleverage and authentication costs, partly offset by lower payment processing fees. Sales and marketing rose by over one point as a percentage of revenue as we invested in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories, while product development was relatively flat as some one-time impacts offset continued hiring of technical talent. Our G&A expense rise as a percentage of revenue due to charitable contributions and other one-time items. In Q4, we recognized a GAAP charge within G&A expense of $50 million related to pending legal matters. You'll see these adjustments including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Additional details on this accrual will be provided in our upcoming Form 10-K. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, up 2% year-over-year, benefiting from a 12% reduction in share count from our share repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, with the delta being driven by a recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 43% to $533 million in Q4, driven primarily by the lapping of cash tax payments on investment sales in the prior year. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.9 billion and gross debt of $8.9 billion, following a successful $1.2 billion debt raise in November. We repurchased roughly $300 million of shares at an average price of approximately $42 during Q4 and have over $2.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $119 million in December or $0.22 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments were valued at approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the sale of a de minimis number of shares in December to satisfy regulatory requirements, our $404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Our Adyen investment value is calculated based on the probability of our remaining warrant tranche successful. In addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2022, we continue to evaluate inorganic opportunities to accelerate our strategic objectives by our Build By Partner framework. We closed the acquisition of 3PM Shield last week, which will strengthen trust in our marketplace, they're helping us prevent and detect problematic listings with even greater precision. Moving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we forecast GMV between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 4% year-over-year. This GMV outlook includes an estimated $100 million from one-time benefits already recognized in Q1 and anticipate an FX headwind to reported growth between two and three points. We expect to generate revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.5 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year. We anticipate a non-GAAP operating margin between 29.1% and 29.7%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.09 and representing EPS growth between flat and up 3% year-over-year. Although, we are not providing full year guidance at this time, given the dynamic operating environment, we will share some directional color on how we are currently thinking about 2023. Our baseline expectation is that the external demand environment does not materially improve during the first half of the year, as a result of continued macro uncertainty across our largest markets. While we do see potential for an improvement in underlying economic conditions as the year progresses, it is too early to predict the second half recovery, buying out with confidence. As a result, we currently expect our sequential GMV growth beyond Q1 to roughly approximately seasonality we observed during 2022, excluding the impact of currency. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue by approximately 2% year-over-year on a spot basis, as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives in 2023. This forecast contemplates one-time impacts to our P&L from recent M&A and the rollout of the eBay International Shipping program this year. These one-time factors combined are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind for operating margin of approximately 120 basis points versus 2022. Our expense growth forecast is also net of roughly $100 million of OpEx savings from our structural cost program as we continue to look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. I'd like to share some additional context on the one-time impact to margin. Over the past year, we accelerated our progress towards several core strategic objectives through the acquisitions of TCGplayer, KnownOrigin, myFitment, and 3PM Shield. While we are excited about the synergies and long-term growth potential of these assets, lowering them into a scale in the marketplace with our level of profitability does present a natural drag on margins in the short-term, which will diminish as our integration work progresses. The rollout of eBay International Shipping will improve seller velocity and global availability of unique inventory over the long run. Our role in intermediating shipping and returns in this program will shift us to principal relationship with sellers versus being an agency in our previous global shipping program. From an accounting perspective, this means revenue from the new program will be recognized on a gross basis, while the vast majority of expenses are variable and recognize the cost of revenue, while the operating margin headwind from this program will abate as we progressively scale it through 2023. It's primarily variable costs or impact to our reported gross margins. We expect this program to generate incremental operating profit this year despite representing a headwind of 30 basis points of gross margin in Q1, rising to 120 basis points in Q4. Additionally, we expect foreign exchange to represent a headwind of approximately 1% of GMV in 2023 and between 3% to 4% to non-GAAP EPS, following the unwinding of recent US dollar strength. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. On the capital allocation front, I'm pleased to announce our Board recently approved a 14% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising to $0.25 per share in 2023. We continue to target returning approximately 125% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2022 and 2024, and our broader capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our fortress balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage in this environment that enables us to invest organically in our business, accelerate our strategic objectives with disciplined inorganic investments, while still delivering healthy capital return to shareholders. In the current macro environment, we believe it is prudent to balance the timing and magnitude of share repurchases with our capital needs from quarter-to-quarter. Our first priority is offsetting dilution, and we expect to be opportunistic with regard to larger repurchases. In closing, our Q4 results capped off a resilient year for eBay in 2022 as we made meaningful progress towards our long-term strategy, despite significant macro uncertainty. We exceeded consensus expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS during Q4. Our focused categories continue to outperform and are driving underlying growth in our business. Our advertising revenue continues to meaningfully outpace volume growth, while payment initiatives continue to scale in line with expectations. We achieved a full year operating margin of 30% despite contending with a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We generated nearly $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, equating to nearly 170% of our free cash flow. I'm proud that eBay continues to pave the way as an industry leader, enabling economic empowerment and sustainability to our platform. We once again achieved carbon neutrality in 2022 and remain committed to reducing 90% of our carbon emissions from our operations by 2030. I'm incredibly appreciative of our team's focus and execution during 2022, as we delivered on a number of our core strategic objectives, despite navigating uncertain macro environment. I'm confident our investments in 2022 enabled us to exit the year stronger than when we entered it, keeping us on a path to sustainable long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Colin. With regard to as payments, versus say is really pleased with the execution from the teams did a tremendous job and we're tracking well towards the direction that we gave at Investor Day in terms of our medium-term targets, in terms of payments and ads. We don't give any specific guidance on the call associated with that in payments for '23, but you should expect them to continue to outpace GMV, as they did in 2022. So, great execution from the teams and pleased with where we are. Hi, Tom, I'll pick up the first one. Obviously, we're seeing different dynamics based on our international business and the U.S. business based on the macro environment - the dynamic macro environment that we've been operating in. And obviously, some of those challenges were more pronounced than the international business earlier than the U.S., and we called out some color with regards to that as we guided the fourth quarter actually in terms of some of the U.S. softness that we saw in October coming through that. The thing I would say is that, the execution our own focused categories, both in Europe and the U.S. is seeing underlying momentum P&A, for example, we're number one in a couple of the key markets in Europe, in the UK and Germany; and number two in the U.S. and things like P&A, luxury, refurb are seeing good momentum both internationally and in the U.S. Specifically, pertaining to the $100 million that we laid out in the prepared comments, this is a specific GMV benefit as a one-time item in Q1, which we do not expect to continue through the year. It's most notably around Chinese sellers, keeping their stores open through the Lunar New Year, which is not typical for this time of year. Jamie over to you? Hi, Nikhil, thank you for the questions. First of all, with regards to the fourth quarter and coming in, as we said in our prepared comments, really pleased to see some of the execution particularly in a couple of key focus categories like P&A and refurb continue to sort of be highlights for the fourth quarter as we came through it. As we've mentioned, came through towards the top end of the guide. And really, we did have less headwind as we'd expected on an exchange rate basis, with the US dollars we went through. But some core strength in a couple of the focus categories as we come through the fourth quarter. With regards to the sequencing, we're dealing with an incredibly dynamic macro environment and we wanted to give some color for the investor community as we start to think about 2023. And obviously, the macro dynamic has been challenged during 2022. And so in that directional color, we've given a comprehensive guide for the first quarter. We continue to execute in the underlying business. But based on the uncertainty that we are facing at the moment and the continuation of that macro challenge we felt it was most prudent just to sort of lay out that sequencing relating to 2023. Hi, Ross, I'll take those. So with regard to the GMV sequencing, we haven't guided the full year. We're just trying to give some directional alignment. We're just trying to plan our business effectively around the dynamic macro environment that we're seeing. Again, put a very comprehensive guide up for the first quarter, really pleased with the execution of the strategy, which is working well and leaning into the focus categories that we're still to execute. We mentioned the fact that we do see as many commentators say, a very, very challenged and certain first half of the year. Again, we're just given some direction on alignment about how we think about things as we navigate through 2023. So just providing some color accordingly. With regards to the Investor Day GMV framework, we're leaning in exactly where we said we would, whether it's luxury, whether it's P&A, Jamie talked extensively about the benefits of authentication impacting the business. And so we are seeing underlying positive growth in our business as we execute the strategy, continue to be fueled by the momentum that we're seeing with payments and ads. In terms of the timing of the GMV framework that we laid out at Investor Day, that's really a function of the potential severity and duration of the macro environment that we're operating in, which will obviously have an indication in terms of the timing of when we get to those longer-term targets. And then finally, with regards to inflation, as you imagine, inflation is impacting a number of our businesses across the US and in Europe. Europe has been more pronounced over recent quarters because of -- particularly because of the energy challenges as we go forward. And in addition, you've got some labor pressure being impacted in Europe as well that's impacting the business. Specifically, around eBay, we do have a resilient business, but however, general inflation does have a, I suppose, a mixed impact on our business because we lead into non-new-in-season items, that really just helped impact where consumers are looking for value, and we have a lot of pre-loved and refurbished items on our platform and that performance in Q4 was a great reflection of that. However, because of the macro challenges, we're not immune to the inflationary pressures on the discretionary consumer spending. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color in terms of how we think about the business. Good afternoon, Doug. I think at a macro level, I would say that we will continue, as we always have been to lean into the short-term to drive operational efficiencies through the likes of the structured cost program where we're going very deep on the organization, while at the same time continue to invest for the future for the long-term trajectory and growth of the business. In terms of the investments we'll be making in 2023 is continue the strategic playbook. It's continuing to invest in product that customers want to continue to invest in trust on the platform and then continue to invest in full funnel marketing in terms of making sure that we get the communication matters out to our customers. The 2% increase in year-over-year non-GAAP expense growth includes the 120 basis points of margin headwinds that we talked about associated with M&A and the eBay International Shipping program, and it's net of $100 million of the structural cost program that we've laid out. So if I stand back, we've got a couple of headwinds with those two items I've talked about. We're leaning in to drive cost efficiencies, and we're continuing to invest for the future long-term sustainability of the business. Yes. So Deepak, we've obviously gotten a very comprehensive Q1 guide. And as I mentioned earlier, because of the uncertainty still the dynamic macro environment, we've not given a full year guide at this point. With regard to the seasonality question that you had, that pertains to directional color associated with GMV. And so that's how I would sort of locate that. Specifically thinking about capital returns that we've laid out, just sort of taking a step back, in 2022, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which is 170% of free cash flow. As you're thinking about capital returns, we remain committed to the 125% of free cash flow target that we laid out at the investor event between 2022 and 2024. So we're sort of tracking above that. And as I think about 2023, our priority really to start with is going to be to be committed to offsetting dilution in terms of the such share count, while continuing to balance the capital needs of the business. We have lent in and done a 14% increase in the dividend from $0.22 to $0.25. But for me, our fortress balance sheet continues to be a key competitive advantage in this environment to enable us to continue to invest in the business. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color about how we're thinking about 2023."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year of consistent execution for eBay, as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories drove underlying growth in our business, as we expanded global coverage for our 16 million Enthusiast Buyers. In motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, growth accelerated as we improved our fitting capabilities, increased supply of OEM parts and enhanced trust signals for buyers. We extended authentication to new categories like trading cards and fine jewelry and opened authentication centers in several new countries for handbags. We opened the Vault to store and usually transact valuable items and adoption has grown steadily week over week. We retired legacy technology, simplified the architecture of our core services and improved our tech velocity. Our advertising growth accelerated as we scaled our three newer Promoted Listings products, optimize performance and automated more elements of campaigns. We expanded our financial services portfolio by adding FX conversion, new forms of payments like Klarna and Afterpay, faster debit card payouts and a digital wallet. And we balanced our investments in innovation with prudent cost discipline to establish a strong foundation for sustainable profitable growth for many years to come. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered solid results in Q4 as our key financial metrics came in ahead of expectations despite the ongoing macro uncertainty. We generated over $18 billion in GMV and more than $2.5 billion in revenue. We delivered an operating margin of close to 30%, while making critical investments in product and marketing to support our long-term growth strategy. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07, up 2% year-over-year. Our focused category strategy was a major component of our strong financial performance during the fourth quarter. Focus categories grew more than 7 points faster than the rest of our marketplace during Q4, which was 2 points faster than the prior quarter. Establishing a game changing level of trust between sellers and buyers has been an important driver of the momentum in our focus categories. Authenticity Guarantee enables trust in our luxury categories like watches, sneakers, handbags and fine jewelry. We have observed notable turnarounds in GMV growth since we launched authentication, improved the product experience and grew awareness to the great inventory in these categories. In aggregate, our luxury focused categories have grown at roughly double-digit CAGR since Q4 of 2019, proving these investments have been highly effective. We dramatically improved trust in our refurbished offering by introducing warranties and half of returns, which attracted more brand and new categories to our marketplace. Those investments paid dividends in Q4 and with positive year-over-year GMV growth and the biggest sales week ever for refurbished goods during Cyber Week. Trust in our motors, parts and accessories category is most reliant on equipement for ensuring the compatibility of auto parts with a specific vehicle. During the last few months, we have taken major steps forward with our fitment capabilities. We acquired myFitment in Q3 to help sellers populate their listings with accurate fitment data, which ensures compatibility for buyers. In Q4, we began making myFitment's technology accessible to all buyers, starting with a pilot group of P&A sellers. Listings enhanced by this technology are seeing a measurable uplift in conversion, and we will expand this program further in 2023. Our significant investments in fitment over the past few years allowed us to launch a prominent Fit Your Vehicle badge in Q4. Similar to the Authenticity Guaranteed logo, we show on luxury goods, this badge provides a clear indication of which parts fit your vehicle throughout the buyer journey across search, merchandising, view item and checkout. This is no small feat with over 500 million active P&A listings on eBay and the increasing complexity of vehicles in the marketplace. These advancements have significantly elevated our capabilities for P&A shoppers, and I'm pleased to share a new program we launched just last week called eBay Guaranteed Fit. This program is the breakthrough for trust and P&A that Authenticity Guarantee is in luxury and warranties are for eBay refurbished. It provides buyers with assurance that eBay will stand behind them if a part doesn't fit their vehicle. Guaranteed Fit is a huge milestone for the P&A category and the culmination of our multiyear fitment journey. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for executing the foundational work, making this program possible and I'm looking forward to seeing their continued innovation in the category. I'm also excited about our team's work in collectibles, which has benefited from a steady cadence of product development and partnerships, including most recently, our live commerce beta. During Q4, we scaled up a number of eBay live events with select sellers, bringing a healthy level of viewers, engagement and GMV to participating sellers. We also introduced the eBay Live Hub, where users can subscribe to channels and receive notifications about future events. This hub will serve as a central discovery point as we broaden the availability of live commerce to more sellers and categories this year. Our acquisition of TCGplayer has also greatly enhanced our collectibles category. And in Q4, we began developing synergies between our respective marketplaces. In addition to its customer base of nearly 800,000 hobbyists, a major competitive advantage for TCGplayer is its relationship with thousands of local brick-and-mortar hobby shops with many subscribing to its point of sale and channel management solution. Due to this software, sellers can now more easily streamline listings and inventory on both TCGplayer and eBay. TCGplayer also further diversified its marketplace by introducing Comex during Q4, which is a natural adjacency to collectible card games. eBay's historical sales data enabled TCGplayer to launch Comex with robust pricing intelligence, which will help us scale this offering. While our integration is in its early days, I'm incredibly excited to see what TCGplayer community will bring to eBay over time. One of the key pillars of our strategy is being the platform of choice for sellers. eBay's scale and global footprint represent key advantages for our platform as we work toward achieving this vision. In 2022, roughly one-fifth of our GMV was facilitated through cross-border trade. Sellers who activate their listings internationally can reach buyers in over 200 countries globally. However, less than half of the inventory in our top three markets is currently available for export due to the friction associated with these transactions. To unlock more valuable inventory for global buyers, last fall, we announced a major revamp of our cross-border capabilities with the launch of eBay International Shipping. Under this program, eBay handles any customs forms, coordinates duties with buyers, and intermediates returns. Sellers are protected from item not received complaints, while buyers benefit from greater selection and lower shipping costs. The program is resonating well as we gradually ramp enrollment for sellers, while buyer satisfaction on eBay International Shipping transactions reached 80%. Steve will discuss the financial implications of this program, and I'm confident it will increase cross-border inventory and drive incremental GMV for eBay. Investments in AI are also improving customer perception of our shipping capabilities. In Q4, we deployed a new machine learning model for estimated delivery date in the U.S. and select international markets, enabling us to make more accurate delivery predictions to buyers. Applying this model in the US reduced the average delivery estimate by one and a half days for all domestic listings, resulting in a noticeable uplift in conversion. A separate model deployed for eligible Authenticity Guarantee products resulted in an average reduction of approximately two days for US listings. These rollouts are just the latest example of our ability to leverage AI to make our existing processes more efficient, which will be a continued focus for us in 2023 and beyond. Moving on to ads. Our marketplace continues to benefit from innovation in our advertising business, which delivered strong growth in Q4 despite headwinds in the broader digital ad market. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue of $276 million, up 27% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth. Over 2 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q4 and we eclipsed $700 million live voted listings. Additionally, our total ad revenue is nearing 1.8% penetration of GMV. Promoted Listing Standard was again the largest contributor to growth, both on a sequential and an annual basis as optimization gains from prior quarters continue to benefit ad rates. In Q4, we also improved our merchandising algorithms to show a greater diversity of products, which improves buyer satisfaction, while also preserving relevance and conversion. Our newer ad products also continued to scale nicely in Q4 and grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click product continues to be a standout among the new products. Seller adoption of Advanced has grown, as we have expanded access and automated more elements of campaign management to make this powerful ad unit easier to use. In Q4, we launched Quick Setup, a one-click campaign creation solution for sellers, where eBay automates and optimizes the campaign structure, ad groups targeting and keyword bids for CPC advertisers. We also introduced multiuser account access across our full suite of promoted listings, which enables eBay sellers to delegate campaign management to trusted third parties like brands or ad agencies. Turning to payments. We continue to roll out additional payment services to support high ASP transactions and improve fire conversion. During Q4, we introduced split payments in the US for transactions over $1,000, enabling buyers to spread large purchases across two credit cards. We've already processed transactions from thousands of buyers at an average order value of over $3,000, and we're excited to expand this offering globally later this year to better support our focus categories. Additionally, building on the success of Afterpay, we recently partnered with Zip to introduce a suite of buy now pay later options to our Australian buyers. Zip supports purchases of up to $10,000, extending our ASP coverage in this valuable market. By managing our end-to-end payments process, we are also able to leverage our own proprietary risk models to assess transaction requests across our marketplace. Last year, our risk and protection team without enhanced controls that allowed us to approve transactions that may have otherwise been declined in the past, enabling over $0.5 billion of annualized GMV and reducing potential escalations to customer service. In connection with risk management, we continue to invest in the security of our marketplace to ensure our capabilities remain world-class. Last week, we announced the acquisition of 3PM Shield, a provider of state-of-the-art marketplace compliance tool. 3PM Shield offers effective solutions for the prevention and identification of counterfeit listings and prohibited items. Combining this technology with our proprietary data, will further enhance the integrity of our marketplace. Before we move on, I'd like to touch on the actions we've taken to sharpen our focus as a company and run our business more efficiently, particularly in light of the uncertain economic environment. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 500 jobs or roughly 4% of our global employee base. This decision followed a thoughtful review of our organization to ensure our people and roles were aligned with priorities that advance eBay's commitment to long-term sustainable growth. These changes provide additional flexibility for us to invest efficiently and create new roles in high potential areas of our business like new technologies, trusted customer experiences and key markets. There is no easy way to say goodbye to our talented colleagues, their passion and accomplishments over the last few years have helped us get us to where we are today. We are incredibly thankful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this difficult transition. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones from our ESG efforts last year, starting with e-commerce. In 2022, our marketplace generated $4.6 billion in positive economic impact through the sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions and kept 73,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. E-commerce continues to provide significant economic benefit for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. And buying pre-loved items shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, just yesterday, we published our third annual e-commerce report, which found that 90% of surveyed respondents engaged in e-commerce during 2022. Cost savings were the most popular motivator for buying pre-loved especially among Gen Z buyers. 64% of whom said its financial savings as a primary reason for shopping e-commerce and sustainability was the second most important factor with people increasingly turning to pre-loved to help the environment. This positions us well as we continue to pave the way as an industry leader enabling economic empowerment and sustainability through our platform. Now, let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. In Q4, eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $35 million. And for the year, customers raised over $163 million. This represents an all-time high in fund raised through eBay for Charity, since we started this program 20 years ago. The eBay Foundation granted nearly $23 million in 2022, primarily to non-profit organizations advancing, inclusive entrepreneurship and through our employee matching gift programs. This represents another all-time high for annual foundation grants. I am fortunate to lead a purpose-driven company with a team dedicated to helping communities around the world, while protecting our planet. For the fourth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. We were also included on CDP's A List for 2022, which recognizes companies that are leading the way in environmental transparency and performance on climate change. Additionally, eBay ranks number one on cross-border commerce Europe's list of the top sustainable marketplaces operating in Europe. Looking to 2023, I'm incredibly excited about the road map ahead of us. Today, I'll offer just a glimpse of a few areas where you should expect to see progress from us this year. We'll continue to innovate for customers in our focus categories and extend to new countries and categories this year. We will continue our work in P&A by expanding the guaranteed FIT program and fifth-year vehicle badge globally. We'll also grow our tire installation capabilities after we began improving the end-to-end tire shopping experience and broaden our network of installation partners in five markets during Q4. We'll ramp assets in the vault and extend eligibility for more collectible items. While integrations with TCG player and known Origin will strengthen our value proposition for collectors. We will also continue to iterate next-gen shopping features like live commerce to better engage with enthusiasts. And we will further develop the category landing pages we debut for sneakers, watches and handbags in Q4, which offer trending inventory and personalized recommendations, powered by machine learning. Sellers across our marketplace will benefit from the expansion of our international shipping program to more markets, which will drive incremental GMV as sellers tap into our global demand. We will continue to scale our advertising offering as we track toward our next $1 billion by 2025, and \u2013 we'll simplify and grow adoption of float listings advance, deliver more AI-driven optimization and further expand our ads portfolio. Finally, just as we have done in focus categories, this year, we will adapt our one-size-fits-all approach, to build more relevant and compelling localized experiences in some of our European markets. We will enhance local discoverability, reduce friction through simplified selling experiences, offer new local forms of payment and address other market-specific experience gaps in search, language and return policies. In closing, I would like to thank our extraordinary eBay employees for their accomplishments this year. Their unrelenting focus on serving our community has supported our sellers and buyers during these challenging economic times. I'm confident that with our talented eBay team, our strategic vision and a persistent focus on operational excellence we will continue to develop compelling experiences for customers and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. So first on the kind of where we are, we're pleased with the progress that we're seeing. So if you think about focused categories outgrowing the rest of the business by 7 points, the double-digit change that we've seen in customer satisfaction, we took on our largest focus category at the end of last year with parts and accessories, and we're seeing that return to market share growth, which is great. It's a very large business. We outlined that at Investor Day being over $10 billion. And the shift that we made to non-new-in-season, I think, is really helping us, especially in these challenging economic times. All the work we did and refurbished to build that as a strong category on eBay. Now we're seeing -- we had our largest week ever during Cyber Week. And during challenging economic times, people really turn to value. And I think we're leaning into where the consumer is headed. I'd point you to the re-commerce Report, which we put out yesterday, which said 90% of the respondents bought re-commerce in 2022 and Gen Z, 64% of them said it was because of the financial value that's provided. So, we think we're right in there. We're going to continue to enhance and build on that strategy. We're doing a lot of additional work in artificial intelligence and bringing that not only to our focused categories, but also to our horizontal businesses. I talk about the work that we did in search as one example of that, the work that we did in advertising with the merchandising there as a second one. And then you see us continuing to expand what we're doing on the horizontal side. I'd just end with eBay International Shipping. Cross-border trade is now one in five transactions on eBay. It's one of the unique value propositions that we have, especially for the individual consumer. And we're making that a whole lot easier with what we're doing with eBay International Shipping, and that's another kind of huge opportunity across the board on the horizontal side. So over the course of the year, I'll get into more and more details about it, but we feel really good about the vector that we're on. Steve, do you want to take the second part? Yes, Tom. So on authenticity, we're feeling great about what we're seeing in terms of the impact that it's having on customer satisfaction and the execution of it. If you think about it for those focused categories like luxury handbag, sneakers, watches, authenticity is what provides the game-changing level of trust. That's different in other categories. So in refurbish, for example, it's the two-year warranties and the 30-day hassle-free returns. And then something like P&A, we just launched this week Guaranteed Fit, which is really the game-changing level of trust, which is guaranteeing that, that part is going to fit your product, which is really key. The acquisition that we did recently with 3PM Shield, it's really a state-of-the-art market compliance capability that they've built using really advanced AI technologies to help keep prohibited items off the platform. And that's really just continuing the theme of building trust on the marketplace, and eBay as a trusted place to shop, which has paid massive dividends, giving us a great ROI from the investments that we've made to-date, and we feel really good about the progress and where we are. Yes, Stephen, I basically would just point you, for example, the parts and accessories, right? What we're doing there is using our knowledge around fitments and all the investments that we've made over the last couple of quarters and being able to say, if you're looking on the site in parts and accessories, you're going to see these big green check marks, let's say, Fits Your Vehicle. And now with what we've released just last week, we're actually going to say it's guaranteed to fit. Think about that as like authenticity guarantee for vehicles. So, we're continuing to category-by-category, find the best way to improve that search experience. And something like refurbished it's certifying the quality of that refurbishment and saying we're going to stand behind that with a 30-day hassle-free return eBay Money-Back Guarantees. So, the combination of the great work that our search team does with AI to really drive more relevance on the platform drive better recall in our search results, et cetera, combined with the category-specific work that we're doing to really optimize that experience on a category-by-category basis, is really the intersection of those two. It's what's working out, I think, so well for us and why we're seeing strong numbers in the strategy and in the focused categories that we've rolled out. Yeah. So -- hi, Deepak, let me take the first one. So yeah, we're really pleased with what we're seeing with focused categories. It's growing seven points faster than the rest of the platform. The way to think about that is plus 2% if you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. When you look at our coverage, we're at about 25% across the whole business. If you look at our big three markets where we've been focusing, it's about 28% coverage, so making nice progress there. But it's not just about investing in new coverage. It's also about investing in existing categories that are driving the underlying growth in our business and balancing reinvestment there. And we're really pleased. We continue to invest in sneakers, we launched two years ago, but we're continuing to invest with manage shipping, which we launched in 2022. We talked on the call about luxury goods having roughly double-digit growth rates over the past couple of years. So we are seeing that market share -- return to market share growth for those businesses, which is really healthy. And I'd say the largest one of which is P&A, and we're really excited by the progress that we're seeing in P&A. On the product side, the work we're doing in fitment and Guaranteed Fit and making the catalog available via the apps. The new acquisition with myFitment, further increasing our ability to do there, combined with the marketing that we're doing in the US, we're doing the actual personalities from car talk in the UK were associated with Pimp My Ride. So we're really going after that enthusiast buyer, and it's really working. So I'm really pleased with the performance on focus categories. Steve, maybe you want to take the second part? Yes. Thanks, Mark. So on the ad side, like we said at Investor Day, we have line of sight to 3%, which we still feel great about. If you look at the performance, Promoted Listing Standard continues to be the workhorse of the product, and we're continuing to drive additional penetration there, hitting 2 million sellers and 700 million listings. But we're also excited by our new products. They once again grew 20% quarter-over-quarter and we're making it easier for sellers. I talked about Quick Setup, which makes it much easier to come into the program and use the program. And then we're working on things like multi-user access, which we just launched which enables more flexibility to actually bring in an ad agency to help you manage your ad campaigns. So I feel great about the potential there, growing 30-plus percent over volume and what we're seeing. On the focused category side, been really happy with the performance of the marketing spend. If you think about it, we've shifted our model from being really kind of lower funnel optimization to doing more full funnel. And that's driving more enthusiast buyers into the platform, and it's allowing the overall spend to work a little bit harder. But at the same time, it's really allowing us to bring buyers in and then leverage them across multiple categories. So if you think about like a sneaker buyer, they will come in and buy $450 in sneakers, but then they'll buy $1,900 in other products in other categories. A handbag buyer will buy $2,500, but then spend $5,000 elsewhere. So when you look at the return on marketing spend, usually full funnel has a longer return on it, but we think it's the absolute right spend. We're seeing the right change in consideration and we're really driving, I think, the unique value proposition that we have to offer at eBay. So, you're going to continue to see, just like we've done in parts, really specific marketing tailored to those enthusiasts with the right full funnel approach, because we like the performance of what we're seeing. Thanks."

Q3 was a strong quarter for the company despite a challenging macro environment. Significant headwinds from inflation, higher energy costs and rising interest rates have impacted discretionary income, and consumer confidence is near record lows in several markets. Our focus on non-new-in-season categories has made the platform more resilient against these headwinds. In the quarter, we continued to execute the tech-led reimagination, and we delivered on our near-term commitments. Focus categories narrowed their gap to market growth rates through higher customer satisfaction, increased trust and more effective marketing. And once again, enthusiast buyers spent more on the platform. This playbook is having a positive impact on GMV in the U.S. and internationally. Site-wide technology investments created a more seamless customer experience, leading to improved conversion rates across the platform. Our advertising business accelerated due to increased seller adoption and the optimization of our ad products. And new payment capabilities remove transactional friction while adding incremental revenue. The execution of our strategy is strengthening our competitive position, which drove better-than-expected financial outcomes in the third quarter. We delivered over $17.7 billion in GMV and almost $2.4 billion in revenue. We invested in marketing and product while delivering close to 29% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1 per share, up double digits versus last year. Before I get into more highlights from the quarter, I want to take a step back and look where we are in our long-term journey. As you may recall, heading into the pandemic, volume was declining. Since that time, we have invested in game-changing product experiences and adjusted our approach to marketing. And this has resulted in an improvement in GMV compared to pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, focus categories, excluding trading cards, are up over 20% since 2019 due to improvements in customer satisfaction, trust, product experience and marketing. Trading cards has more than doubled in that time due to market dynamics and the impact of our innovations. And the rest of the platform has improved from declining low single digits to flat based on site-wide product improvements and the benefits of cross-category shopping. Taking a closer look at Q3 volume, excluding trading cards, focus categories grew over seven points faster than the rest of the platform compared to last year. Multiple quarters of improvements in parts and accessories, collectibles, luxury goods and refurbished products are driving better relative GMV performance. Motors parts and accessories is the largest category we have invested in to date, and it is nearing market rates of growth. Investments in marketing over multiple quarters have increased consideration with enthusiasts, expanding the top of the funnel. Most recently, we sponsored an automotive makeover show with MTV U.K. We also kicked off the eBay Motors Parts of America tour, showcasing bespoke car builds using parts found on eBay. Hundreds of thousands of attendees have joined these events to date, and social marketing support for the tour has driven more than 500 million impressions. The key to unlocking trust for parts and accessories enthusiasts is fitment. Over the last several quarters, we made significant progress on the foundational work needed to innovate the P&A experience. This included modernizing our taxonomy to align our business globally and open up new cross-border trade opportunities. We also integrated fitment-based technologies into search, merchandising and advertising recommendations. Now we're able to make fitment more pervasive throughout the end-to-end experience. We have started adding highly visible trust signals throughout the buyer journey in the U.S. and Canada. We also are reducing the number of steps it takes to find parts, and we've expanded the adoption of My Garage, leading to more personalized shopping on every visit. We will continue to invest in trust to deliver even higher customer satisfaction in the coming quarters. In addition, we are working on increasing the quality and quantity of supply in parts and accessories. We recently acquired Mine Pivot, which helps P&A sellers improve listing quality and grow conversion. We are also directly engaging sellers to add more in-demand parts inventory, including certified green parts, OEM, salvage and highest products, keeping our global supply over 500 million live listings. Collectibles is another focus category where sellers and buyers are responding positively to recent innovation. One of the best examples of this is trading cards, where GMV trends remained steady at a trajectory more than double pre-pandemic levels. In June, we launched the eBay Vault, a seamless end-to-end physical and digital experience and have initially opened it for trading cards. The Vault provides a number of benefits, including instant transfer, authentication, insurance, affordable shipping and tax restorage. The combination of these features gives enthusiasts an unprecedented level of control to grow the value of their collections. During Q3, we expanded eligibility for Vault items, and we are seeing continued momentum week over week and are encouraged by the effectiveness of events and accelerating early adoption. While the Vault is in its early days, demand is increasing, and more enthusiasts are preloading their inventory into the Vault to enable faster trading. In addition to innovation, we are marketing our trading cards business across multiple channels. For example, in Q3, we expanded our presence at New York Comic Con to showcase the eBay Vault and continued live commerce pilots, highlighting brands like Funko and Metazoo. Another important investment for our trading card business is the acquisition of TCG Player, a trusted marketplace for collectible card game enthusiasts that operates a leading technology platform. I am pleased that we were able to close this transaction earlier this week ahead of schedule. TCG Player brings strategic omnichannel capabilities, popular with trading card sellers, including inventory management tools, order fulfillment and card optimization. I'm excited to see what we can do together to delight our sellers and buyers over time. In luxury categories, quarter after quarter of innovation has led to higher customer satisfaction and faster GMV growth. This has been true in watches, handbags and sneakers since the introduction of authentication, resulting in higher GMV in every country where we've launched to date. In Q3, we began authenticating jewelry about $500 in the U.S. and are seeing similar results as other focus categories with initial customer satisfaction rates for jewelry buyers over 90%. Focus category is not the only area where we are investing to drive GMV. Significant site-wide initiatives that impact all sellers and buyers are driving volume benefits across all categories. Multiple quarters of technology investment drove site-wide conversion improvements in Q3. For example, in search, we leveraged new deep learning models to better understand purchase intent, leading to increased conversion at the top of search. In addition, search recall has materially improved for low and well searches, enabling buyers to discover more relevant inventory. These capabilities have rolled out to English and German-speaking markets, adding more than $0.5 billion in GMV annually. SEO improvements are driving better growth across the platform. In focus categories like sneakers, we have built a more modern browsing experience, which is driving benefits to our SEO traffic. We also optimized our site to allow significantly more items to show up on search engines, increasing visibility to our newest and best performing listings. For sellers, we have been making investments over several quarters to modernize our technology stack. And I'm excited to announce that we recently completed the migration of all desktop sellers to a single unified listing experience globally. This transition eliminates multiple legacy tools and enables faster innovation, particularly as we invest in new focus category listing experiences. There are a number of benefits sellers are already seeing in the new platform. For example, when listing an item, sellers are receiving better price guidance recommendations that are driving conversion in multiple categories. And sellers can now directly upload videos that can showcase items, highlight unique details or answer commonly asked questions. Sellers are also benefiting from multiple quarters of innovation and advertising. Higher return on ad spend is leading to increased adoption of Promoted Listings and higher ad rates. In Q3, first-party ad revenue was $249 million, up 27% year-over-year. This was more than 30 points faster than GMV, keeping us on track toward our long-term advertising targets despite volume headwinds from the macro environment. Investments in AI have resulted in improved search algorithm performance and more accurate ad rate recommendations that are increasing conversion. This is one factor driving up adoption of Standard Promoted Listings. In Q3, almost 2 million sellers adopted at least one ad product, and our coverage has expanded to over 600 million listings. Our newer ad products are also driving faster growth, which once again grew double-digits quarter-over-quarter. For Promoted Listings Advanced, we expanded availability in search. We also improved the broad match experience and upgraded our recommendation tools, allowing sellers to further optimize their campaigns. Payments capabilities are increasing trust between sellers and buyers by removing transactional friction. The buyer FX experience that we've released earlier this year is resonating with customers. Close to 70% are adopting it for cross-currency transactions, allowing them to pay in their local currency. We also expanded Klarna availability to buyers who cross-border transactions on our German site. Lastly, our risk team improves checkout conversion by accepting more purchase transactions while maintaining low loss levels. In addition to removing friction for buyers, we are adding more services for sellers. Recently, we announced that sellers can request on-demand payouts to a debit card and receive funds within 30 minutes or less for a fee. New payment services are delivering better customer outcomes, and the pace of innovation has put us on track to deliver $300 million in incremental revenue by 2024. As consumers in our major markets face persistent inflation, higher interest rates and rising home energy costs, they are increasingly turning to eBay for better value. This is leading to growth in GMV of used and refurbished goods. In fact, in a recent survey, we found that more than three quarters of sellers use eBay to sell pre-owned goods. Recently, we expanded our efforts to support sustainable commerce with a new seller education offering on eBay Academy. Launched across our major markets, our new course teaches sellers had to assess their current practices and understand how eBay can help them operate more sustainably. Sellers are contributing positively to global communities in other ways. During the third quarter, we raised more than $33 million through eBay for Charity. In addition, the eBay Foundation issued grants to 50 nonprofit organizations that support inclusive entrepreneurship and communities around the world. These purpose-driven efforts help us drive economic opportunity for all. Finally, we're excited to announce that tomorrow, we will be publishing our inaugural small business report. This report highlights our progress towards becoming a seller platform of choice. I've spoken to you in the past about how eBay creates access for entrepreneurs. And through our recent small business survey, we found that seven out of 10 sellers say that eBay help them start their business. We are proud to partner with our sellers, helping them get up and running on our marketplace and providing the tools they need to build scale and grow their business. Sellers recognize these efforts with over half of all sellers surveyed strongly agreeing that eBay helped their small business grow. As a third-party marketplace, eBay only wins when our sellers win. And we have earned trust from our seller community over time. In this report, 95% of sellers surveyed say they rely on eBay for their business with almost one third saying their small business would not exist without eBay. This data helps to reinforce that the investments we are making reflect the role we play in creating and growing small businesses around the world. Having just come off a number of large seller events in our major markets, we continue to be inspired by our seller community, and we are proud to play a key role in helping our customers navigate these challenging economic times. All of this couldn't be possible without our talented and dedicated teams who work so hard to innovate on behalf of our customers. Thank you to the eBay team for all you do every day for our community. In closing, the resiliency of our platform yielded better-than-expected quarterly results despite a challenging macro backdrop. focus categories grew over seven points faster than the rest of the platform and maintained higher levels of customer satisfaction. We acquired TCG Player and My Fitment to better serve enthusiasts in two of our largest focus categories. Site-wide improvements in search, SEO and selling improved conversion rates. Advertising growth accelerated while delivering high returns on ad spend for our sellers. Payments innovation enabled more services and further reduced transactional friction, and we continue to support our small business sellers, helped raise $33 million for charity and drove close to $1 billion in economic impact through e-commerce. All of these accomplishments contributed towards our long-term tech-led reimagination of eBay. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the third quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter with some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise. Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter results as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives while efficiently navigating the challenging short-term macro environment. Our GMV revenue on non-GAAP EPS each came in above expectations and surpassed the high end of our guidance ranges. Gross merchandise volume declined 5%, improving nearly nine points sequentially. Revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion, outpacing volume by nearly four points, primarily due to continued momentum within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 28.9%, up modestly quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic pillars. We delivered $1 of non-GAAP earnings per share of 11% over the prior year. And we generated $633 million of free cash flow, while returning $421 million to shareholders to repurchasing dividends. Our Q3 results highlight the strength of our scaled marketplace, durability of our financial model and impact of our tech-led reimagination on eBay's underlying growth trajectory. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 5% year-over-year, but accelerated nearly nine points sequentially as easier comps offset the tougher macro environment in Q3. The war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to wear on consumer confidence and demand for discretionary goods. In addition, recent currency volatility widened the FX headwind to our reported GMV growth to approximately six points in Q3 compared to roughly four points in the prior quarter. Despite of these headwinds, our business remains resilient and markedly healthier than when we entered the pandemic, boosted by returns from our investments, which focus category and site-wide innovation across the eBay platform. Our focus on non-new-in-season goods have multiple benefits. It aligns us with the fastest-growing portion of our TAM and extends the life of products. It also makes our marketplace more durable during periods of economic turbulence. Preowned, refurbished, open box and vintage goods are attractive alternatives to brand new items of value orientating buyer. eBay scale global demand for these goods provides supplemental income seller, which can mitigate the burden of the rising cost of living. Preowned and refurbished goods alone make up over 1/3 of our GMV, and are growing significantly faster than brand new goods on eBay in recent years. Brand disparity has become more pronounced since the onset of macro weakness [indiscernible]. GMV from the used and refurb goods has maintained double-digit growth versus 2019 since the start of the pandemic, even if demand for discretionary goods has been pressured in recent quarters. Our focus category strategy continue to drive underlying growth in our business during Q4. Excluding trading cards, focus category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by over seven points year-over-year, has increased more than 20% versus 2019. In aggregate, our marketplace grew 6% versus Q3 of 2019, primarily driven by faster growth in focus capital, but also supported by relatively stable volume in other categories. It's important to note we've been seeing compelling evidence that other categories are benefiting from our strategy as well. Higher customer satisfaction and focus categories raises trust across the eBay platform. [indiscernible] engage in cross category shopping provide a multiplier effect for our business. The site-wide product improvements have alleviated friction to sellers and buyers across our marketplace. Even amidst the challenging macro environment, our GMV and other categories in Q3 was roughly flat versus the same period in 2019. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. Our U.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q3 of 2019, or more than two points faster than Q2, aided by slightly easier comps. International GMV was down 3% over the same period, roughly in line with Q2. Although the macro headwinds I outlined earlier are weighing on the most global economies, the effects are more pronounced in Europe through September. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across most of our largest markets. European consumers remain even more cautious as they face significant energy price hikes this winter. The labor strikes accompanied by rising cost of living also threaten the near-term outlook. Despite these headwinds, [indiscernible] focus category volume modestly outpaced other categories internationally in Q2. eBay's strong value proposition and past successes end up taking countercyclical [indiscernible] products contributed to this delta. However, the economic situation in Europe has also fueled strength in other categories, which now is a relative growth gap in Q3. For example, demand for home energy products in Germany has temporarily surged as consumers cope with rising utility prices and the uncertainty of energy availability that they're heavy [indiscernible]. Moving to active buyers. 135 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months, including 2 million buyers from our Turkish business, where we ceased operations in July. Active buyers, excluding T\u00fcrkiye, were down 2 million quarter-over-quarter, a more modest step down in prior quarters. Notably, to 90% of our buyers who churned in Q3 were low-value buyers. Enthusiast buyers accounted for approximately 17 million of our active buyers in Q3. Downward migration between the enthusiast and mid-value buyer groups decelerated as lapping headwind. Macro pressure may continue to cause migration between buyer groups in the short term. An average spend per user who sequentially and continues to be healthy at over $3,000 per year, up double digits versus 2019. Turning to revenue. Net revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion during the third quarter, an acceleration of netted five points compared to Q2. Our transaction take rate was 12.8% due to this, an increase of nearly 40 basis points sequentially and close to 100 basis points versus the prior year. Advertising was the primary driver of our take rate increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. Recent foreign currency volatility was also a significant driver of the increase versus Q2 as we reported GMV growth is more impacted by FX headwinds than revenue due to our hedging practices. Total advertising revenue grew 22% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 27%. Our pacing volume by more than 30 points. This marked an acceleration of more than 10 points versus the GMV [indiscernible] in Q2 as both Promoted Listings and total ads reflects the double-digit growth we have anticipated. This strong result was primarily driven by continued optimization of our Standard Promoted Listings product, along with ramping contributions for [indiscernible] ad products, which continue to grow adoption and evolve their capabilities. Although our ad growth benefited from some onetime changes and a significant portfolio expansion this year, we are pleased our ad business remains on track to roughly double by 2025, despite a tougher macro environment that we have contemplated back in March. As expected, advertising surpassed managed payments as a primary driver of our take rate growth as the payment migration is nearly complete in Q3 of last year. Payments contributed roughly 10 basis points of our sequential take rate increase due to the ramp of new payment services. We are pleased these additional services remain on track to meet the $300 million target [indiscernible] invest that. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.9% in Q3, up nearly 30 basis points sequentially, but down close to three points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly in line with the prior year, while sales and marketing and product development were notable areas of investment as we continue to invest in our focus categories and site-wide public accountants. We delivered $1 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 11% which is ahead of expectations due to volume upsizing cost efficiency. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.13, primarily driven by losses on our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 26% to $633 million in Q3, largely due to the timing of working capital items. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $4.8 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased roughly $300 million of `shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3, and have more than $3.1 billion remaining into our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $120 million in September, or $0.22 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends, or roughly double our free cash flow. Although our share repurchases are elevated during the first half of the year due to our excess cash position, our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged. Earlier this week, we closed our acquisition of TCG Player ahead of schedule for a total consideration of up to $295 million in cash. We are excited to have the team on board and expect them to accelerate innovation in our collectibles category. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our investor presentation. Our equity investment stake provided approximately $3 billion at the end of Q3. Our $405 million Adevinta shares was valued at roughly $2.4 billion. We saw the remainder of the Adyen shares acquired through the first tranche of warrants for approximately $120 million in Q3. Our remaining Adyen investment is calculated based on the estimated value of our remaining warrant tranches. As always, we continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. Moving on to our outlook. Despite our resilient performance in Q3, -- the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across our major markets, while the effects of the energy crisis in Europe may worsen as temperatures fall during the fourth quarter. Recent and upcoming Royal Mail strikes in the U.K. and other industry workforce disruptions across the region has incremental risk during the holiday. And despite the relative strength of the U.S. consumer through September, [indiscernible] exposed to decades high inflation appears to be softening demand [indiscernible]. In October, growth in our U.S. volume slowed by several points versus our 2019 [indiscernible]. In addition, recent declines in the Euro and Sterling led to an incremental FX headwind of approximately $300 million in Q4 GMV versus our prior outlook. Our hedging program should mitigate much of the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS within the fourth quarter. For Q4, we now expect to generate between $17.5 billion and $18.1 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline between 9% and 6% with an FX headwind to spot growth of roughly seven points. We anticipate revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.5 billion, equating to a decline between 4% and 1% year-over-year. We forecasted non-GAAP operating margin between 29.7% to 30.3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.09, which were negative 2% and positive 4% year-over-year growth. For the duration of severity of the current macro headwinds remain as certain, recent trends suggest it's increasingly likely that will represent a meaningful headwind to our business well into the coming year. Additionally, if the strength of the U.S. dollar as a hold at today's rates, FX would represent an estimated headwind of three points to year-over-year GMV growth 2022. We would also face a five to six point headwind in non-GAAP earnings per share next year. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS, despite an increasingly challenging macro environment. Our marketplace remains resilient in the face of inflationary pressures. And our non-new-in-season focus enables to offer consumers low-cost alternatives to brand new products. Our advertising business accelerated meaningfully, while new payment services are scaling in line with expectations, providing incremental capacity for investments. Our fortress balance sheet, differentiated scale and durable financial model enable us to mitigate the margin impact of recent macro pressure, protect investments in our core strategic initiatives, and generate healthy earnings and cash flow. And we've returned roughly double our free cash flow to shareholders through repurchasing dividends this year, alongside inorganic investments to accelerate our strategy. Finally, I'm incredibly appreciative of how our employees have maintained their focus and support of our community during this challenging time. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I know you talked about doing more full funnel marketing in the focus categories. Just curious about some of the results that you're seeing there, and then how you've expanded those efforts more materially to some other categories as well. And if you could just comment on the buyback as well, a smaller number than what we've seen in recent quarters. If there's any commentary you can add there. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Hi, Doug, I'll take the first one. So part of our strategy and the shift on our marketing was really to approach this full funnel marketing and move away from just kind of lower funnel optimization. And that's worked out really well for us. So if you look, for example, at P&A, we're seeing good strength in P&A. We're approaching market growth rates and what we're doing there. And importantly, we're driving consideration. And that whole strategy has really been around, not just going after buyers, but going after enthusiast buyers. It's why you see us in the parts shows, in the sponsoring like I talked about, the U.K. MTV reboot, it's really aimed at that. And so we started that playbook with sneakers and some of our luxury, and it worked well. We've been expanding it to P&A. And so we're continuing to look at it because what we're seeing is it changes initial consideration for those categories. And then we get the multiplier effect that I talked about at Investor Day, plus it makes the lower funnel work harder, work easier with the support of the upper funnel. Steve, do you want to take the one on buyback?\nSteve Priest: Yes, of course, hi Doug. Yes, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. We've been doing this extensively over the last number of years, and we'll continue to do so. I wouldn't be looking at this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In fact, if you look year-to-date, we're tracking well ahead of the targets we laid out at our Investor Day, while we're committed to return 125% of the free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've returned $3.2 billion or 200% of our free cash flow. So buybacks and dividends will continue to be a core component of value creation for our shareholders and completed with where we are.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks Jamie and Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, curious what is embedded in the guidance in terms of the macro environment changing Q4 versus Q3? Are you willing to give us some sense of the bottom end of the range versus the top of the range, and maybe some elements of how macroeconomic volatility might push you in one direction or another as you look out over the next couple of months? And then looking beyond just one quarter forward, if the macroeconomic activity did become more volatile, how should we be thinking about those investments that you want to make next year, whether it's enthusiast buyer growth or focus categories that are most investments where you're willing to make them irrespective of the margin impact in a downward economic activity environment versus elements of where you can pull on levers to sort of manage margin outcomes if the overall volumes were to slow? Thanks so much.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Eric, good afternoon. It's Steve, I'll pick this up. So as you would imagine, we've taken a very balanced and thoughtful approach to our Q4 guide. It's an incredibly dynamic macro environment that we're navigating through. So there's a number of factors that I'd highlight. The first one would be the underlying consumer environment. That obviously continues to be pressured. We've seen that for several quarters in Europe. And in October, in line with the prepared comments, we began to see U.S. consumer demand start to weaken. Secondly, we do expect further energy challenges as we enter the winter. And we're also facing labor challenges in Europe, particularly the Royal Mail, who are -- got a series of strikes in the U.K. And then thirdly, we are seeing the impact of currency. The U.S. is obviously particularly strong against the Euro and Sterling, which is impacting both our forecast and our reported results. So what I would say in terms of the fourth quarter, given the uncertainty of this environment, we have purposely given a wider range of potential outcomes. But really the -- where we ultimately land in the quarter will be a function of the macro environment and how that goes forward. Specifically, as we think going forward in terms of investment, I think that's the beauty of the eBay architecture and the durability of our financial model. We've continued to lean in, in the short term to drive operational effectiveness as we think about our business. And that sort of manifests itself in cost savings as we go through. Secondly, the business continues to be fueled by the ad strength that we saw in the third quarter and the momentum that we're seeing and the investments that we're making in payments. As we think about going forward, we will continue to invest in the core business, and we will protect that as we navigate the forthcoming quarters to continue to drive for the strategy and protect the long-term growth of the enterprise. That's what we've done for the last few quarters, and it's what we'll continue to do, and our financial architecture enables us to do that.\nEric Sheridan: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks and good afternoon. I guess, first off, I want to go back to the comment, I think, Jamie, you made it around cross-category shopping from focus over to non-focus categories. I was hoping you could dig into that a little bit more with respect to how large an impact that's having, and if that's something that will pick up speed in coming quarters. And then maybe regarding the October trends in the U.S., does that suggest that some of the resiliency of the platform in non-new-in-season that you mentioned in Europe that maybe that's not as applicable in the U.S. market? Or is it just a matter of timing with respect to when these geographies are weakening? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so first thing I'd say is that we are seeing strength in our refurbished and used. It's about a third of our GMV, and that's up double-digits versus 2019. So in terms of the consumer reacting to the challenging economic times. In terms of the cross category that we laid out in March, we continue to see that. And the metrics are very helpful as we think about the caps we can afford to pay and how we leverage our focus categories across the business. So if I take the example of a sneakers buyer, an average buyer who buys a $100 pair of sneakers, they'll spend about [indiscernible] on sneakers, but $1,900 outside of sneakers and other categories. If I look at that number for handbags, we just expanded what we're doing in handbag authentication, a buyer who buys over $500, they'll spend $2,500 in handbags, but $5,000 in the other categories. So that is really key for us when you think about our strategy that we laid out at Investor Day with really driving focus categories. Part of the propping up of non-focus, in addition to the horizontal work that we're doing, is the impact of the cross-category shopping when we bring a buyer into focus categories. So we're doing more and more programs to help make that available to buyers and accelerate that, but we feel really good about the stats of what we're seeing there.\nSteve Priest: Colin, and I'll pick up the other one. Specifically, your question about the U.S. as we get into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. It's pretty broad-based. I continue to be pleased to see the delta between our focus category penetration and momentum versus non-focus categories based on the investments that we're making. But as we look forward, as we look into October, it's pretty broad-based across all the categories that we have on the platform. One of the things I would say on an international basis, we are seeing some non-focus category momentum in Germany, in particular, as the German community continue to be concerned about energy availability as we get into the winter, and we're seeing pockets of non-focus category inventory get some momentum on the platform. But overall, I think all this is a reflection of the broader macroeconomic climate that we're operating within.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thanks guys. So can you talk about generally cross-border activity, I guess, on the back of the stronger U.S. dollar versus almost all other global currencies? And I know there's a natural hedge there, but are there certain larger corridors or categories which might be giving you an outsized headwind or a tailwind? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so a couple of things I'd say. One is there's been some easing of the supply chain as demand has come down, which has certainly helped from that perspective of our sellers. Obviously, currency differences make an impact in terms of certain corridors are stronger depending on the strength of any given currency. But we're leaning into the opportunities in cross-border trade. And I'd highlight two specific things. One is that we've actually with the rollout of buyer effects, made it easier in terms of currency choice for the buyer to buy in their local currency or in their -- in the currency of the seller. And we've seen a 70% adoption of that, and it's been performing well. We expanded that now into 38 currencies. The other thing that we're doing is making it easier starting with our U.S. business to do exports and execute exports on the business. So we've had a global shipping program for quite some time to make it easier. But the new enhancements that we're making or attempting to make it as easier to ship from Northern California to Southern California as shipping an international product off to Central America and really taking the friction out of that for our sellers. So those are the things that I would highlight in terms of the focus of what we're doing on a cross-border business.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And apologies if this was asked before. Sorry, I was jumping around a few calls. I know you called out the outperformance of focus categories versus the rest. That's encouraging to see trends in the right direction. But can you give additional color on what the growth is on some of the larger focus categories inside that generic term? With some of them now kind of a few months under the new experience, how do you feel about these efforts helping with sustainable long-term growth in them? And then maybe a second question. Can you also provide some additional color on how currency weighs on your margins? Is there a sort of a framework to think about how some of the key currencies like Euro maybe on a sensitivity basis could weigh on percentage of margin points? Thank you so much.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so first on focus categories, we're pretty pleased with the performance that we're seeing across the board. I'd highlight a couple of things. First of all, our trading cards business continues to be at twice the volume it was coming into the pandemic. When I look at parts and accessories, the work that we're doing around fitment and specifically around driving initial consideration is helping us move towards market rates of growth there. And as we highlighted at our Investor Day, it's a huge category over $10 billion of GMV. The other thing that I would highlight is that as we've expanded the playbook from the U.S. to international, we're seeing the same type of impact that we saw in the international markets as we saw in U.S., so if I look at our luxury categories, this is sneakers, watches and handbags, we're seeing double-digit year-over-year growth in those categories internationally and higher customer satisfaction, similar to what we saw in our U.S. market. So we're continuing to lean in. You saw our recent announcement of jewelry and authenticating jewelry over $500. That's led to customer satisfaction over 90%. And we're going to continue to push forward and roll out additional categories and continue to improve in the focus categories that we've already launched. Steve, do you want to take the currency?\nSteve Priest: Yes, hi Deepak. And good afternoon. First on the highlights on the short-term. We have a great track record here at eBay of managing FX volatility. The teams do a really nice job. And that obviously, GMV is an operational metric that is not -- that continues to be exposed and is not insulated from changes in exchange. But quarter-to-quarter, we continue to hedge ROI, revenue and EPS. And so the quarter-to-quarter impacts are rather de minimis. What we've called out today is about the longer term. So if the U.S. dollar remains in a strong position it is today, and that continues through 2023, there is a natural challenge that you would incur as you get into '23 because it's much further out from a hedging standpoint. And we would expect that headwind to be approximately three points on GMV and between five and six points to EPS, which obviously, from that perspective, because product is going to be revenue would have an implication on margins. And really, that's a reflection of if the U.S. dollar remained at its current state versus the Euro and Sterling.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCurtis Nagle: Good afternoon, thanks very much for taking the question. So I wanted to dig a little more into the strong advertising numbers in the quarter. And I guess just what drove the incremental improvement from 2Q, right? So you guys have rolled out a number of initiatives with the Promoted Listing Advanced and a few other things. Did that pick up more? Or was it perhaps sellers maybe trying to get a little bit more visibility through your platform in a retail backdrop that's just a little more competitive and a little bit more promotional. What's driven that improvement?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, we're really pleased with the performance of the ads revenue up 27% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. I'd say the reaccelerated growth is really driven by two factors. One is just the optimization of our Promoted Listing Standard that improved search algorithm performance, and we created more accurate ad rate recommendations that helped us increase conversion. And the second is just the ongoing contribution from our new ad products. Our three new products contributed double-digits quarter-on-quarter. So certainly, in Q3, it had some onetime step-ups from the product optimization and from that portfolio expansion of three new products, the external, advanced and our other products. But when I think about it, the thing that makes me bullish on our product is when I think about the ROAS, we're still having a really healthy ROAS. And so the benefit of -- to our sellers is -- continues to be healthy. So we're on track to meet our stated goals of doubling our ads business by 2025.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay, thanks. It's really helpful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Hi, thank you very much. Two questions for me, please. One, at Analyst Day, you guys presented some targets. I think it was mid-single-digit GMV growth in 2023, 2024, and total margin expansion of about 100 bps 2022 to 2024. I know a lot happened since then already. Just wanted to get a sense from you guys, sitting where you sit right now on the back of this performance, if you think those targets are still achievable? And second, on the M&A, I was wondering, Jamie, maybe if you guys have any interest in expanding further into the use of luxury apparel maybe through M&A, just given some depressed valuations for some of the players that we've seen out there. I think through the acquisition of TCG, you guys now have some fulfillment -- order fulfillment capabilities. Wondering if doing the same thing in luxury apparel could be attractive to you? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Youssef, I'll pick up the first one. We remain confident in the long-term goals that we laid out at our Investor event back in March. The strategy is clearly working. We're coming out of the pandemic in a much stronger position than we went into it. GMV is continued to be fueled in our focus categories by the investments we continue to make. The payments entity within our enterprise has continued to deliver. And we're well on track for the $300 million that we laid out back in March. And as you've heard from our prepared remarks, our advertising business is moving very strongly. So I'm very encouraged by the investments we're making in the long-term strategy and how that's getting executed. The timing of the delivery of the goals that we laid out is really going to be a function of the macro environment in which we're operating in. It's very, very clear in terms of the severity of the headwinds that are going through, it's likely to continue to impact us in 2023. As we've talked about, we expect that to sort of go into the next year. But really, it's around that severity and duration, that will imply the timing of when we get to those long-term targets that we continue to be confident in.\nJamie Iannone: And let me just take the M&A one. Yes, M&A has been and will continue to be a key part of our strategy. I've talked about the Build By Partner framework that we have. And as you noted, TCG Player was really about helping us in a core category of collectibles and specifically in collectible trading cards, giving us new capabilities and tools and access to local hobby shops. I'd also point to My Fitment, which I've talked for two quarters now about the importance of Fitment, building trust in the parts and accessories category, and so excited by that one. So you should expect us to continue to look at key areas such as vertical expansion or boosting our core strategy, tech and talent and then opportunities to expand our overall capabilities. Always doing it in the framework that I've outlined to Build By Partner that we think has the best return for shareholders.\nYoussef Squali: Great, thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Blackledge: Great, thanks. Two questions. First, how are the enthusiast buyers holding up in the current macro environment? Have you noticed any changes sequentially, call it, 3Q versus 2Q or versus 1Q? And then second question, kind of a follow-up on the advertising business. Should we think that the ads will grow through these challenging macro headwinds in 4Q and into '23, similar to the strength that we saw in the third quarter? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on enthusiast buyers. In Q3, we had 17 million enthusiast buyers, which was relatively flat to Q2. And so the way you think about that is we're no longer facing the tough lapping from our comps related to the COVID dynamics. But we do expect some pressure on that count in the coming quarters as a result of the current macro environment. But when we look at it, the vast majority of enthusiasts remain active buyers. It's just a movement between mid-value and enthusiast buyers. And for us, enthusiast buyers is a very healthy spend. If you think about the average spend of that being $3,000 a year, that's up to like membership level spend. So over the next few years, we expect enthusiast buyers to continue to grow and spend more as we continue to execute on our strategy. As I talked about, their spend is up double-digits versus '19, so really healthy. So the other thing I'd say on the ad business is we don't expect it to be linear quarter-to-quarter. But we've been enhancing and adding new products. I talked about the quarter-over-quarter growth that we're seeing in our new products. So we're on track to $2 billion. As I said, there were some onetime step-up things that we saw in Q3. But overall, our ROAS is healthy. I mentioned the statistics on the call that we now have two million sellers who have purchased at least one ad product in their listing, which is healthy. So we feel right on track with the goals that we outlined back in Investor Day.\nJohn Blackledge: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Your line is open. Richard Kramer, your line is open.\nRichard Kramer: Sorry, I was on mute. Jamie, in your recent FT interview, you basically raised the white flag about talking about in-season, new in-season goods and not competing with some of the bigger players. Can you give us a sense of what proportion of GMV these still represents as you're transitioning the business to the enthusiast-focus category as you mentioned? And then also, just to dig in a little bit on the algo changes you made and that led to the acceleration in advertising. Can you quantify or track what sort of GMV resulted from the incremental $40 million your sellers would have invested in ads this quarter? Are you able to directly see that, that advertising investment that gets made is lifting GMV in some material way? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so on the first question, when we think about the non-new in season, it represents about 90% of what we sell on the platform. So that's both used and refurbished and think N minus 1 last year's fashion, white label goods, all of those types of things. So the majority of what we sell is actually in the non-new-in-season business that we have on the platform. The stat that I talked about earlier is that one-third of our business is -- about one-third of our GMV is used and refurbished, and that's actually accelerating faster given the ties that we see. In terms of the advertising money that our sellers are spending, the majority of what we collect is via our CPA-based program, which is Promoted Listing Standard, which is a direct attribution program. So as we're able to drive incremental sales for them, we monetize that. So we've added the new products, like the CPC-based products in Promoted Listings Advanced. But what we're doing from a CPA standpoint has a direct tie to GMV. I would say the same is true for our seller program, which is partnering with our sellers to drive external traffic to their listings on eBay, which as I said before, sellers are seeing a really good ROAS on our platform, especially relative to other places that they can market their products.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Thank you.\nJoe Billante: Operator, we have time for one more.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Sean Dunlop with Morningstar. Your line is open.\nSean Dunlop: Great, thanks for squeezing me in. So a lot of my questions have been asked, but just trying to think a little bit about GMV sensitivity and potential consumer trade down. So for the 3P marketplaces, it can sometimes be a little bit tougher for us to see. But I'm wondering if you could indicate how much pricing sellers have taken on the eBay platform even if that's just truly ASP? And if that potentially improves the eBay value proposition on a relative basis? And then my second question would be about 32% of GMV from used and refurb goods that you talked about, Jamie. I'm just curious how that held up in the last big downturn maybe in 2007 to 2009? I appreciate it.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So I'd say in general, we're not immune to the macro impact. And so Steve talked earlier in his remarks about we think there'll be likely meaningful headwinds into '23. But we do have a more resilient business model because of the shift in focus of moving towards non-new-in-season and refurbished. And so that 32% is growing faster than the rest of the site. And I would just say, in general, value is a key tent-pole for our buyers on the site, and we're continuing to push it. From some perspective, I think this is a double win for us because we've been pushing e-commerce, we love, et cetera, as part of our massive ESG efforts that we have on the platform and really being the pioneers of re-commerce and saving products from the landfill, et cetera. And now where consumers want to value, we're seeing a real willingness to purchase there. The last thing I'd say is that Gen Z is much more inclined to buy pre-owned and pre-loved goods, and so we're leaning into that trend. So it's great to see that from the value standpoint. It's also great in terms of the ESG impact that it has in the business. I'd like to say that ESG is so core to eBay that we should be in every ESG fund because of the importance of it and the role we play in re-commerce. But that's how I would kind of characterize where we are today, and I think what we'll see into the coming quarters.\nSean Dunlop: Great, thanks. Very helpful.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the third quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter with some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise. Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter results as we made significant progress against our long-term objectives while efficiently navigating the challenging short-term macro environment. Our GMV revenue on non-GAAP EPS each came in above expectations and surpassed the high end of our guidance ranges. Gross merchandise volume declined 5%, improving nearly nine points sequentially. Revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion, outpacing volume by nearly four points, primarily due to continued momentum within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 28.9%, up modestly quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic pillars. We delivered $1 of non-GAAP earnings per share of 11% over the prior year. And we generated $633 million of free cash flow, while returning $421 million to shareholders to repurchasing dividends. Our Q3 results highlight the strength of our scaled marketplace, durability of our financial model and impact of our tech-led reimagination on eBay's underlying growth trajectory. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 5% year-over-year, but accelerated nearly nine points sequentially as easier comps offset the tougher macro environment in Q3. The war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to wear on consumer confidence and demand for discretionary goods. In addition, recent currency volatility widened the FX headwind to our reported GMV growth to approximately six points in Q3 compared to roughly four points in the prior quarter. Despite of these headwinds, our business remains resilient and markedly healthier than when we entered the pandemic, boosted by returns from our investments, which focus category and site-wide innovation across the eBay platform. Our focus on non-new-in-season goods have multiple benefits. It aligns us with the fastest-growing portion of our TAM and extends the life of products. It also makes our marketplace more durable during periods of economic turbulence. Preowned, refurbished, open box and vintage goods are attractive alternatives to brand new items of value orientating buyer. eBay scale global demand for these goods provides supplemental income seller, which can mitigate the burden of the rising cost of living. Preowned and refurbished goods alone make up over 1/3 of our GMV, and are growing significantly faster than brand new goods on eBay in recent years. Brand disparity has become more pronounced since the onset of macro weakness [indiscernible]. GMV from the used and refurb goods has maintained double-digit growth versus 2019 since the start of the pandemic, even if demand for discretionary goods has been pressured in recent quarters. Our focus category strategy continue to drive underlying growth in our business during Q4. Excluding trading cards, focus category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by over seven points year-over-year, has increased more than 20% versus 2019. In aggregate, our marketplace grew 6% versus Q3 of 2019, primarily driven by faster growth in focus capital, but also supported by relatively stable volume in other categories. It's important to note we've been seeing compelling evidence that other categories are benefiting from our strategy as well. Higher customer satisfaction and focus categories raises trust across the eBay platform. [indiscernible] engage in cross category shopping provide a multiplier effect for our business. The site-wide product improvements have alleviated friction to sellers and buyers across our marketplace. Even amidst the challenging macro environment, our GMV and other categories in Q3 was roughly flat versus the same period in 2019. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. Our U.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q3 of 2019, or more than two points faster than Q2, aided by slightly easier comps. International GMV was down 3% over the same period, roughly in line with Q2. Although the macro headwinds I outlined earlier are weighing on the most global economies, the effects are more pronounced in Europe through September. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across most of our largest markets. European consumers remain even more cautious as they face significant energy price hikes this winter. The labor strikes accompanied by rising cost of living also threaten the near-term outlook. Despite these headwinds, [indiscernible] focus category volume modestly outpaced other categories internationally in Q2. eBay's strong value proposition and past successes end up taking countercyclical [indiscernible] products contributed to this delta. However, the economic situation in Europe has also fueled strength in other categories, which now is a relative growth gap in Q3. For example, demand for home energy products in Germany has temporarily surged as consumers cope with rising utility prices and the uncertainty of energy availability that they're heavy [indiscernible]. Moving to active buyers. 135 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months, including 2 million buyers from our Turkish business, where we ceased operations in July. Active buyers, excluding Tu\u0308rkiye, were down 2 million quarter-over-quarter, a more modest step down in prior quarters. Notably, to 90% of our buyers who churned in Q3 were low-value buyers. Enthusiast buyers accounted for approximately 17 million of our active buyers in Q3. Downward migration between the enthusiast and mid-value buyer groups decelerated as lapping headwind. Macro pressure may continue to cause migration between buyer groups in the short term. An average spend per user who sequentially and continues to be healthy at over $3,000 per year, up double digits versus 2019. Turning to revenue. Net revenue was down 2% to approximately $2.4 billion during the third quarter, an acceleration of netted five points compared to Q2. Our transaction take rate was 12.8% due to this, an increase of nearly 40 basis points sequentially and close to 100 basis points versus the prior year. Advertising was the primary driver of our take rate increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. Recent foreign currency volatility was also a significant driver of the increase versus Q2 as we reported GMV growth is more impacted by FX headwinds than revenue due to our hedging practices. Total advertising revenue grew 22% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 27%. Our pacing volume by more than 30 points. This marked an acceleration of more than 10 points versus the GMV [indiscernible] in Q2 as both Promoted Listings and total ads reflects the double-digit growth we have anticipated. This strong result was primarily driven by continued optimization of our Standard Promoted Listings product, along with ramping contributions for [indiscernible] ad products, which continue to grow adoption and evolve their capabilities. Although our ad growth benefited from some onetime changes and a significant portfolio expansion this year, we are pleased our ad business remains on track to roughly double by 2025, despite a tougher macro environment that we have contemplated back in March. As expected, advertising surpassed managed payments as a primary driver of our take rate growth as the payment migration is nearly complete in Q3 of last year. Payments contributed roughly 10 basis points of our sequential take rate increase due to the ramp of new payment services. We are pleased these additional services remain on track to meet the $300 million target [indiscernible] invest that. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.9% in Q3, up nearly 30 basis points sequentially, but down close to three points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly in line with the prior year, while sales and marketing and product development were notable areas of investment as we continue to invest in our focus categories and site-wide public accountants. We delivered $1 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 11% which is ahead of expectations due to volume upsizing cost efficiency. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.13, primarily driven by losses on our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 26% to $633 million in Q3, largely due to the timing of working capital items. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $4.8 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased roughly $300 million of `shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3, and have more than $3.1 billion remaining into our current authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $120 million in September, or $0.22 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends, or roughly double our free cash flow. Although our share repurchases are elevated during the first half of the year due to our excess cash position, our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged. Earlier this week, we closed our acquisition of TCG Player ahead of schedule for a total consideration of up to $295 million in cash. We are excited to have the team on board and expect them to accelerate innovation in our collectibles category. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our investor presentation. Our equity investment stake provided approximately $3 billion at the end of Q3. Our $405 million Adevinta shares was valued at roughly $2.4 billion. We saw the remainder of the Adyen shares acquired through the first tranche of warrants for approximately $120 million in Q3. Our remaining Adyen investment is calculated based on the estimated value of our remaining warrant tranches. As always, we continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. Moving on to our outlook. Despite our resilient performance in Q3, -- the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. Consumer confidence remains near historic lows across our major markets, while the effects of the energy crisis in Europe may worsen as temperatures fall during the fourth quarter. Recent and upcoming Royal Mail strikes in the U.K. and other industry workforce disruptions across the region has incremental risk during the holiday. And despite the relative strength of the U.S. consumer through September, [indiscernible] exposed to decades high inflation appears to be softening demand [indiscernible]. In October, growth in our U.S. volume slowed by several points versus our 2019 [indiscernible]. In addition, recent declines in the Euro and Sterling led to an incremental FX headwind of approximately $300 million in Q4 GMV versus our prior outlook. Our hedging program should mitigate much of the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS within the fourth quarter. For Q4, we now expect to generate between $17.5 billion and $18.1 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline between 9% and 6% with an FX headwind to spot growth of roughly seven points. We anticipate revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.5 billion, equating to a decline between 4% and 1% year-over-year. We forecasted non-GAAP operating margin between 29.7% to 30.3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.09, which were negative 2% and positive 4% year-over-year growth. For the duration of severity of the current macro headwinds remain as certain, recent trends suggest it's increasingly likely that will represent a meaningful headwind to our business well into the coming year. Additionally, if the strength of the U.S. dollar as a hold at today's rates, FX would represent an estimated headwind of three points to year-over-year GMV growth 2022. We would also face a five to six point headwind in non-GAAP earnings per share next year. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS, despite an increasingly challenging macro environment. Our marketplace remains resilient in the face of inflationary pressures. And our non-new-in-season focus enables to offer consumers low-cost alternatives to brand new products. Our advertising business accelerated meaningfully, while new payment services are scaling in line with expectations, providing incremental capacity for investments. Our fortress balance sheet, differentiated scale and durable financial model enable us to mitigate the margin impact of recent macro pressure, protect investments in our core strategic initiatives, and generate healthy earnings and cash flow. And we've returned roughly double our free cash flow to shareholders through repurchasing dividends this year, alongside inorganic investments to accelerate our strategy. Finally, I'm incredibly appreciative of how our employees have maintained their focus and support of our community during this challenging time. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yes, of course, hi Doug. Yes, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. We've been doing this extensively over the last number of years, and we'll continue to do so. I wouldn't be looking at this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In fact, if you look year-to-date, we're tracking well ahead of the targets we laid out at our Investor Day, while we're committed to return 125% of the free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've returned $3.2 billion or 200% of our free cash flow. So buybacks and dividends will continue to be a core component of value creation for our shareholders and completed with where we are. Hi, Eric, good afternoon. It's Steve, I'll pick this up. So as you would imagine, we've taken a very balanced and thoughtful approach to our Q4 guide. It's an incredibly dynamic macro environment that we're navigating through. So there's a number of factors that I'd highlight. The first one would be the underlying consumer environment. That obviously continues to be pressured. We've seen that for several quarters in Europe. And in October, in line with the prepared comments, we began to see U.S. consumer demand start to weaken. Secondly, we do expect further energy challenges as we enter the winter. And we're also facing labor challenges in Europe, particularly the Royal Mail, who are -- got a series of strikes in the U.K. And then thirdly, we are seeing the impact of currency. The U.S. is obviously particularly strong against the Euro and Sterling, which is impacting both our forecast and our reported results. So what I would say in terms of the fourth quarter, given the uncertainty of this environment, we have purposely given a wider range of potential outcomes. But really the -- where we ultimately land in the quarter will be a function of the macro environment and how that goes forward. Specifically, as we think going forward in terms of investment, I think that's the beauty of the eBay architecture and the durability of our financial model. We've continued to lean in, in the short term to drive operational effectiveness as we think about our business. And that sort of manifests itself in cost savings as we go through. Secondly, the business continues to be fueled by the ad strength that we saw in the third quarter and the momentum that we're seeing and the investments that we're making in payments. As we think about going forward, we will continue to invest in the core business, and we will protect that as we navigate the forthcoming quarters to continue to drive for the strategy and protect the long-term growth of the enterprise. That's what we've done for the last few quarters, and it's what we'll continue to do, and our financial architecture enables us to do that. Colin, and I'll pick up the other one. Specifically, your question about the U.S. as we get into the fourth quarter and the holiday season. It's pretty broad-based. I continue to be pleased to see the delta between our focus category penetration and momentum versus non-focus categories based on the investments that we're making. But as we look forward, as we look into October, it's pretty broad-based across all the categories that we have on the platform. One of the things I would say on an international basis, we are seeing some non-focus category momentum in Germany, in particular, as the German community continue to be concerned about energy availability as we get into the winter, and we're seeing pockets of non-focus category inventory get some momentum on the platform. But overall, I think all this is a reflection of the broader macroeconomic climate that we're operating within. Yes, hi Deepak. And good afternoon. First on the highlights on the short-term. We have a great track record here at eBay of managing FX volatility. The teams do a really nice job. And that obviously, GMV is an operational metric that is not -- that continues to be exposed and is not insulated from changes in exchange. But quarter-to-quarter, we continue to hedge ROI, revenue and EPS. And so the quarter-to-quarter impacts are rather de minimis. What we've called out today is about the longer term. So if the U.S. dollar remains in a strong position it is today, and that continues through 2023, there is a natural challenge that you would incur as you get into '23 because it's much further out from a hedging standpoint. And we would expect that headwind to be approximately three points on GMV and between five and six points to EPS, which obviously, from that perspective, because product is going to be revenue would have an implication on margins. And really, that's a reflection of if the U.S. dollar remained at its current state versus the Euro and Sterling. Hi, Youssef, I'll pick up the first one. We remain confident in the long-term goals that we laid out at our Investor event back in March. The strategy is clearly working. We're coming out of the pandemic in a much stronger position than we went into it. GMV is continued to be fueled in our focus categories by the investments we continue to make. The payments entity within our enterprise has continued to deliver. And we're well on track for the $300 million that we laid out back in March. And as you've heard from our prepared remarks, our advertising business is moving very strongly. So I'm very encouraged by the investments we're making in the long-term strategy and how that's getting executed. The timing of the delivery of the goals that we laid out is really going to be a function of the macro environment in which we're operating in. It's very, very clear in terms of the severity of the headwinds that are going through, it's likely to continue to impact us in 2023. As we've talked about, we expect that to sort of go into the next year. But really, it's around that severity and duration, that will imply the timing of when we get to those long-term targets that we continue to be confident in."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was a strong quarter for the company despite a challenging macro environment. Significant headwinds from inflation, higher energy costs and rising interest rates have impacted discretionary income, and consumer confidence is near record lows in several markets. Our focus on non-new-in-season categories has made the platform more resilient against these headwinds. In the quarter, we continued to execute the tech-led reimagination, and we delivered on our near-term commitments. Focus categories narrowed their gap to market growth rates through higher customer satisfaction, increased trust and more effective marketing. And once again, enthusiast buyers spent more on the platform. This playbook is having a positive impact on GMV in the U.S. and internationally. Site-wide technology investments created a more seamless customer experience, leading to improved conversion rates across the platform. Our advertising business accelerated due to increased seller adoption and the optimization of our ad products. And new payment capabilities remove transactional friction while adding incremental revenue. The execution of our strategy is strengthening our competitive position, which drove better-than-expected financial outcomes in the third quarter. We delivered over $17.7 billion in GMV and almost $2.4 billion in revenue. We invested in marketing and product while delivering close to 29% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1 per share, up double digits versus last year. Before I get into more highlights from the quarter, I want to take a step back and look where we are in our long-term journey. As you may recall, heading into the pandemic, volume was declining. Since that time, we have invested in game-changing product experiences and adjusted our approach to marketing. And this has resulted in an improvement in GMV compared to pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, focus categories, excluding trading cards, are up over 20% since 2019 due to improvements in customer satisfaction, trust, product experience and marketing. Trading cards has more than doubled in that time due to market dynamics and the impact of our innovations. And the rest of the platform has improved from declining low single digits to flat based on site-wide product improvements and the benefits of cross-category shopping. Taking a closer look at Q3 volume, excluding trading cards, focus categories grew over seven points faster than the rest of the platform compared to last year. Multiple quarters of improvements in parts and accessories, collectibles, luxury goods and refurbished products are driving better relative GMV performance. Motors parts and accessories is the largest category we have invested in to date, and it is nearing market rates of growth. Investments in marketing over multiple quarters have increased consideration with enthusiasts, expanding the top of the funnel. Most recently, we sponsored an automotive makeover show with MTV U.K. We also kicked off the eBay Motors Parts of America tour, showcasing bespoke car builds using parts found on eBay. Hundreds of thousands of attendees have joined these events to date, and social marketing support for the tour has driven more than 500 million impressions. The key to unlocking trust for parts and accessories enthusiasts is fitment. Over the last several quarters, we made significant progress on the foundational work needed to innovate the P&A experience. This included modernizing our taxonomy to align our business globally and open up new cross-border trade opportunities. We also integrated fitment-based technologies into search, merchandising and advertising recommendations. Now we're able to make fitment more pervasive throughout the end-to-end experience. We have started adding highly visible trust signals throughout the buyer journey in the U.S. and Canada. We also are reducing the number of steps it takes to find parts, and we've expanded the adoption of My Garage, leading to more personalized shopping on every visit. We will continue to invest in trust to deliver even higher customer satisfaction in the coming quarters. In addition, we are working on increasing the quality and quantity of supply in parts and accessories. We recently acquired Mine Pivot, which helps P&A sellers improve listing quality and grow conversion. We are also directly engaging sellers to add more in-demand parts inventory, including certified green parts, OEM, salvage and highest products, keeping our global supply over 500 million live listings. Collectibles is another focus category where sellers and buyers are responding positively to recent innovation. One of the best examples of this is trading cards, where GMV trends remained steady at a trajectory more than double pre-pandemic levels. In June, we launched the eBay Vault, a seamless end-to-end physical and digital experience and have initially opened it for trading cards. The Vault provides a number of benefits, including instant transfer, authentication, insurance, affordable shipping and tax restorage. The combination of these features gives enthusiasts an unprecedented level of control to grow the value of their collections. During Q3, we expanded eligibility for Vault items, and we are seeing continued momentum week over week and are encouraged by the effectiveness of events and accelerating early adoption. While the Vault is in its early days, demand is increasing, and more enthusiasts are preloading their inventory into the Vault to enable faster trading. In addition to innovation, we are marketing our trading cards business across multiple channels. For example, in Q3, we expanded our presence at New York Comic Con to showcase the eBay Vault and continued live commerce pilots, highlighting brands like Funko and Metazoo. Another important investment for our trading card business is the acquisition of TCG Player, a trusted marketplace for collectible card game enthusiasts that operates a leading technology platform. I am pleased that we were able to close this transaction earlier this week ahead of schedule. TCG Player brings strategic omnichannel capabilities, popular with trading card sellers, including inventory management tools, order fulfillment and card optimization. I'm excited to see what we can do together to delight our sellers and buyers over time. In luxury categories, quarter after quarter of innovation has led to higher customer satisfaction and faster GMV growth. This has been true in watches, handbags and sneakers since the introduction of authentication, resulting in higher GMV in every country where we've launched to date. In Q3, we began authenticating jewelry about $500 in the U.S. and are seeing similar results as other focus categories with initial customer satisfaction rates for jewelry buyers over 90%. Focus category is not the only area where we are investing to drive GMV. Significant site-wide initiatives that impact all sellers and buyers are driving volume benefits across all categories. Multiple quarters of technology investment drove site-wide conversion improvements in Q3. For example, in search, we leveraged new deep learning models to better understand purchase intent, leading to increased conversion at the top of search. In addition, search recall has materially improved for low and well searches, enabling buyers to discover more relevant inventory. These capabilities have rolled out to English and German-speaking markets, adding more than $0.5 billion in GMV annually. SEO improvements are driving better growth across the platform. In focus categories like sneakers, we have built a more modern browsing experience, which is driving benefits to our SEO traffic. We also optimized our site to allow significantly more items to show up on search engines, increasing visibility to our newest and best performing listings. For sellers, we have been making investments over several quarters to modernize our technology stack. And I'm excited to announce that we recently completed the migration of all desktop sellers to a single unified listing experience globally. This transition eliminates multiple legacy tools and enables faster innovation, particularly as we invest in new focus category listing experiences. There are a number of benefits sellers are already seeing in the new platform. For example, when listing an item, sellers are receiving better price guidance recommendations that are driving conversion in multiple categories. And sellers can now directly upload videos that can showcase items, highlight unique details or answer commonly asked questions. Sellers are also benefiting from multiple quarters of innovation and advertising. Higher return on ad spend is leading to increased adoption of Promoted Listings and higher ad rates. In Q3, first-party ad revenue was $249 million, up 27% year-over-year. This was more than 30 points faster than GMV, keeping us on track toward our long-term advertising targets despite volume headwinds from the macro environment. Investments in AI have resulted in improved search algorithm performance and more accurate ad rate recommendations that are increasing conversion. This is one factor driving up adoption of Standard Promoted Listings. In Q3, almost 2 million sellers adopted at least one ad product, and our coverage has expanded to over 600 million listings. Our newer ad products are also driving faster growth, which once again grew double-digits quarter-over-quarter. For Promoted Listings Advanced, we expanded availability in search. We also improved the broad match experience and upgraded our recommendation tools, allowing sellers to further optimize their campaigns. Payments capabilities are increasing trust between sellers and buyers by removing transactional friction. The buyer FX experience that we've released earlier this year is resonating with customers. Close to 70% are adopting it for cross-currency transactions, allowing them to pay in their local currency. We also expanded Klarna availability to buyers who cross-border transactions on our German site. Lastly, our risk team improves checkout conversion by accepting more purchase transactions while maintaining low loss levels. In addition to removing friction for buyers, we are adding more services for sellers. Recently, we announced that sellers can request on-demand payouts to a debit card and receive funds within 30 minutes or less for a fee. New payment services are delivering better customer outcomes, and the pace of innovation has put us on track to deliver $300 million in incremental revenue by 2024. As consumers in our major markets face persistent inflation, higher interest rates and rising home energy costs, they are increasingly turning to eBay for better value. This is leading to growth in GMV of used and refurbished goods. In fact, in a recent survey, we found that more than three quarters of sellers use eBay to sell pre-owned goods. Recently, we expanded our efforts to support sustainable commerce with a new seller education offering on eBay Academy. Launched across our major markets, our new course teaches sellers had to assess their current practices and understand how eBay can help them operate more sustainably. Sellers are contributing positively to global communities in other ways. During the third quarter, we raised more than $33 million through eBay for Charity. In addition, the eBay Foundation issued grants to 50 nonprofit organizations that support inclusive entrepreneurship and communities around the world. These purpose-driven efforts help us drive economic opportunity for all. Finally, we're excited to announce that tomorrow, we will be publishing our inaugural small business report. This report highlights our progress towards becoming a seller platform of choice. I've spoken to you in the past about how eBay creates access for entrepreneurs. And through our recent small business survey, we found that seven out of 10 sellers say that eBay help them start their business. We are proud to partner with our sellers, helping them get up and running on our marketplace and providing the tools they need to build scale and grow their business. Sellers recognize these efforts with over half of all sellers surveyed strongly agreeing that eBay helped their small business grow. As a third-party marketplace, eBay only wins when our sellers win. And we have earned trust from our seller community over time. In this report, 95% of sellers surveyed say they rely on eBay for their business with almost one third saying their small business would not exist without eBay. This data helps to reinforce that the investments we are making reflect the role we play in creating and growing small businesses around the world. Having just come off a number of large seller events in our major markets, we continue to be inspired by our seller community, and we are proud to play a key role in helping our customers navigate these challenging economic times. All of this couldn't be possible without our talented and dedicated teams who work so hard to innovate on behalf of our customers. Thank you to the eBay team for all you do every day for our community. In closing, the resiliency of our platform yielded better-than-expected quarterly results despite a challenging macro backdrop. focus categories grew over seven points faster than the rest of the platform and maintained higher levels of customer satisfaction. We acquired TCG Player and My Fitment to better serve enthusiasts in two of our largest focus categories. Site-wide improvements in search, SEO and selling improved conversion rates. Advertising growth accelerated while delivering high returns on ad spend for our sellers. Payments innovation enabled more services and further reduced transactional friction, and we continue to support our small business sellers, helped raise $33 million for charity and drove close to $1 billion in economic impact through e-commerce. All of these accomplishments contributed towards our long-term tech-led reimagination of eBay. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. Hi, Doug, I'll take the first one. So part of our strategy and the shift on our marketing was really to approach this full funnel marketing and move away from just kind of lower funnel optimization. And that's worked out really well for us. So if you look, for example, at P&A, we're seeing good strength in P&A. We're approaching market growth rates and what we're doing there. And importantly, we're driving consideration. And that whole strategy has really been around, not just going after buyers, but going after enthusiast buyers. It's why you see us in the parts shows, in the sponsoring like I talked about, the U.K. MTV reboot, it's really aimed at that. And so we started that playbook with sneakers and some of our luxury, and it worked well. We've been expanding it to P&A. And so we're continuing to look at it because what we're seeing is it changes initial consideration for those categories. And then we get the multiplier effect that I talked about at Investor Day, plus it makes the lower funnel work harder, work easier with the support of the upper funnel. Steve, do you want to take the one on buyback? Yes, so first thing I'd say is that we are seeing strength in our refurbished and used. It's about a third of our GMV, and that's up double-digits versus 2019. So in terms of the consumer reacting to the challenging economic times. In terms of the cross category that we laid out in March, we continue to see that. And the metrics are very helpful as we think about the caps we can afford to pay and how we leverage our focus categories across the business. So if I take the example of a sneakers buyer, an average buyer who buys a $100 pair of sneakers, they'll spend about [indiscernible] on sneakers, but $1,900 outside of sneakers and other categories. If I look at that number for handbags, we just expanded what we're doing in handbag authentication, a buyer who buys over $500, they'll spend $2,500 in handbags, but $5,000 in the other categories. So that is really key for us when you think about our strategy that we laid out at Investor Day with really driving focus categories. Part of the propping up of non-focus, in addition to the horizontal work that we're doing, is the impact of the cross-category shopping when we bring a buyer into focus categories. So we're doing more and more programs to help make that available to buyers and accelerate that, but we feel really good about the stats of what we're seeing there. Yes, so a couple of things I'd say. One is there's been some easing of the supply chain as demand has come down, which has certainly helped from that perspective of our sellers. Obviously, currency differences make an impact in terms of certain corridors are stronger depending on the strength of any given currency. But we're leaning into the opportunities in cross-border trade. And I'd highlight two specific things. One is that we've actually with the rollout of buyer effects, made it easier in terms of currency choice for the buyer to buy in their local currency or in their -- in the currency of the seller. And we've seen a 70% adoption of that, and it's been performing well. We expanded that now into 38 currencies. The other thing that we're doing is making it easier starting with our U.S. business to do exports and execute exports on the business. So we've had a global shipping program for quite some time to make it easier. But the new enhancements that we're making or attempting to make it as easier to ship from Northern California to Southern California as shipping an international product off to Central America and really taking the friction out of that for our sellers. So those are the things that I would highlight in terms of the focus of what we're doing on a cross-border business. Yes, so first on focus categories, we're pretty pleased with the performance that we're seeing across the board. I'd highlight a couple of things. First of all, our trading cards business continues to be at twice the volume it was coming into the pandemic. When I look at parts and accessories, the work that we're doing around fitment and specifically around driving initial consideration is helping us move towards market rates of growth there. And as we highlighted at our Investor Day, it's a huge category over $10 billion of GMV. The other thing that I would highlight is that as we've expanded the playbook from the U.S. to international, we're seeing the same type of impact that we saw in the international markets as we saw in U.S., so if I look at our luxury categories, this is sneakers, watches and handbags, we're seeing double-digit year-over-year growth in those categories internationally and higher customer satisfaction, similar to what we saw in our U.S. market. So we're continuing to lean in. You saw our recent announcement of jewelry and authenticating jewelry over $500. That's led to customer satisfaction over 90%. And we're going to continue to push forward and roll out additional categories and continue to improve in the focus categories that we've already launched. Steve, do you want to take the currency? Yes. So look, we're really pleased with the performance of the ads revenue up 27% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. I'd say the reaccelerated growth is really driven by two factors. One is just the optimization of our Promoted Listing Standard that improved search algorithm performance, and we created more accurate ad rate recommendations that helped us increase conversion. And the second is just the ongoing contribution from our new ad products. Our three new products contributed double-digits quarter-on-quarter. So certainly, in Q3, it had some onetime step-ups from the product optimization and from that portfolio expansion of three new products, the external, advanced and our other products. But when I think about it, the thing that makes me bullish on our product is when I think about the ROAS, we're still having a really healthy ROAS. And so the benefit of -- to our sellers is -- continues to be healthy. So we're on track to meet our stated goals of doubling our ads business by 2025. And let me just take the M&A one. Yes, M&A has been and will continue to be a key part of our strategy. I've talked about the Build By Partner framework that we have. And as you noted, TCG Player was really about helping us in a core category of collectibles and specifically in collectible trading cards, giving us new capabilities and tools and access to local hobby shops. I'd also point to My Fitment, which I've talked for two quarters now about the importance of Fitment, building trust in the parts and accessories category, and so excited by that one. So you should expect us to continue to look at key areas such as vertical expansion or boosting our core strategy, tech and talent and then opportunities to expand our overall capabilities. Always doing it in the framework that I've outlined to Build By Partner that we think has the best return for shareholders. Yes, so on enthusiast buyers. In Q3, we had 17 million enthusiast buyers, which was relatively flat to Q2. And so the way you think about that is we're no longer facing the tough lapping from our comps related to the COVID dynamics. But we do expect some pressure on that count in the coming quarters as a result of the current macro environment. But when we look at it, the vast majority of enthusiasts remain active buyers. It's just a movement between mid-value and enthusiast buyers. And for us, enthusiast buyers is a very healthy spend. If you think about the average spend of that being $3,000 a year, that's up to like membership level spend. So over the next few years, we expect enthusiast buyers to continue to grow and spend more as we continue to execute on our strategy. As I talked about, their spend is up double-digits versus '19, so really healthy. So the other thing I'd say on the ad business is we don't expect it to be linear quarter-to-quarter. But we've been enhancing and adding new products. I talked about the quarter-over-quarter growth that we're seeing in our new products. So we're on track to $2 billion. As I said, there were some onetime step-up things that we saw in Q3. But overall, our ROAS is healthy. I mentioned the statistics on the call that we now have two million sellers who have purchased at least one ad product in their listing, which is healthy. So we feel right on track with the goals that we outlined back in Investor Day. Yes, so on the first question, when we think about the non-new in season, it represents about 90% of what we sell on the platform. So that's both used and refurbished and think N minus 1 last year's fashion, white label goods, all of those types of things. So the majority of what we sell is actually in the non-new-in-season business that we have on the platform. The stat that I talked about earlier is that one-third of our business is -- about one-third of our GMV is used and refurbished, and that's actually accelerating faster given the ties that we see. In terms of the advertising money that our sellers are spending, the majority of what we collect is via our CPA-based program, which is Promoted Listing Standard, which is a direct attribution program. So as we're able to drive incremental sales for them, we monetize that. So we've added the new products, like the CPC-based products in Promoted Listings Advanced. But what we're doing from a CPA standpoint has a direct tie to GMV. I would say the same is true for our seller program, which is partnering with our sellers to drive external traffic to their listings on eBay, which as I said before, sellers are seeing a really good ROAS on our platform, especially relative to other places that they can market their products. Thank you. Yes. So I'd say in general, we're not immune to the macro impact. And so Steve talked earlier in his remarks about we think there'll be likely meaningful headwinds into '23. But we do have a more resilient business model because of the shift in focus of moving towards non-new-in-season and refurbished. And so that 32% is growing faster than the rest of the site. And I would just say, in general, value is a key tent-pole for our buyers on the site, and we're continuing to push it. From some perspective, I think this is a double win for us because we've been pushing e-commerce, we love, et cetera, as part of our massive ESG efforts that we have on the platform and really being the pioneers of re-commerce and saving products from the landfill, et cetera. And now where consumers want to value, we're seeing a real willingness to purchase there. The last thing I'd say is that Gen Z is much more inclined to buy pre-owned and pre-loved goods, and so we're leaning into that trend. So it's great to see that from the value standpoint. It's also great in terms of the ESG impact that it has in the business. I'd like to say that ESG is so core to eBay that we should be in every ESG fund because of the importance of it and the role we play in re-commerce. But that's how I would kind of characterize where we are today, and I think what we'll see into the coming quarters. Thanks, Sean."

With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this year, during our Investor Day, we updated you on the progress of our Tech-Led Reimagination and outlined our vision for the future. I'm really excited about the pace at which our talented teams are delivering against that plan. Our focus category playbook is working. Enthusiast buyers are spending more, and advertising and payments continue to grow. This quarter, we launched several key innovations in line with our long-term objectives. These ongoing efforts have put eBay in a stronger position today than it was when we entered the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that during the second quarter, we delivered better than expected financial results across the board. We delivered over $18.5 billion in GMV and over $2.4 billion in revenue. We continue to invest in marketing and product while achieving close to 29% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.99. Our focus category payments and advertising initiatives helped offset the impact of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a more uncertain macro environment. Looking ahead, we remain on track to deliver on our full year commitments, and we'll continue to invest and manage towards sustainable long-term growth. Later in the call, Steve will go into more detail about our outlook. One of the most important pillars of our long-term plan is our focus category strategy. Investments in trust, product experience and marketing are increasing customer satisfaction, leading to faster volume growth. Last quarter, excluding trading cards, focus category GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. Trading cards are lower than last year's [stimulus fuelled] (ph) results, but volume remains robust at more than double prepandemic levels. We are seeing significant outperformance in focus categories globally. Although the US is higher than international. The primary reasons for the difference are the timing of launches and category mix by market. The markets where it's implemented these changes, customer satisfaction remains at or near best-in-class levels. The vast majority of our enthusiast buyer shop in focus categories and their spending levels remain above $3,000 per year. We continue to see cross-category shopping activity consistent with data we shared during Investor Day in March. One of our largest focus categories is parts and accessories, which is one of the highest buyer NPS scores on the platform. We know from experience how crucial trust is, and fitment is one of the best enablers of trust. To ensure every buyer finds the perfect part to fit their vehicle, we are enhancing all of the AI that powers search, merchandising and advertising. In addition, we have rolled out more ways for P&A enthusiasts to discover the wide range of inventory on eBay. In our international markets, we have added over 100,000 fitment-based browse pages last quarter alone. We also expanded our supply of OEM and certified green parts. To drive demand to our huge supply of P&A inventory, we continue to invest in full-funnel marketing. Initial consideration is showing encouraging early signs, and we see further opportunity to attract more enthusiasts. Across other focus categories, we took several steps over the past quarter to expand coverage. To enhance our leadership position in trading cards, we expanded authentication services to a wider range of graded items. In addition, we rolled out a new feature where enthusiasts can now use the popular My Collections tool to track a broader set of inventory, including sports trading cards. In eBay Refurbished, we added more trusted sellers and expanded categories in the program. These included headphones, audio, gaming consoles and smart home devices. Refurbished products are growing faster than new products in the same category, in part due to increased customer satisfaction. And in sneakers, we added more products to our catalog, which now includes the top 40 brands across our 4 largest markets. This expansion reduces friction in selling and buying experiences. We also started authenticating handbags in Germany and handbag accessories such as wallets in the U.S. The next focus category where we are innovating and changing the customer experience is jewelry. Recently, we announced authentication for eligible new and preowned jewelry items over $500. We are partnering with GIA, the Gemological Institute of America, who bring 90 years of experience to our partnership. Like other focus categories, we will improve the product experience, increase customer satisfaction and change how we market to jewelry enthusiasts over time. I am pleased with the near-term progress in focus categories, and we remain on track to expand coverage and drive growth back towards market rates. Equally important is evolving our capabilities to attract the next generation of enthusiast buyers. In Q2, we took several steps toward that objective. In June, we marked an important milestone with the opening of the eBay Vault. This state-of-the-art facility enables a new format for sellers and buyers to trade and build their collections in real time. The Vault is initially accepting graded authenticated trading cards above $500 and will expand to more products over time. Sellers are taking advantage of an initial year of free storage and no selling fees for Vault sales. This innovation will help us transform many product categories. One reason that we're excited to launch the Vault is because it can enable real-time transactions for physical or digital goods. This intersection is nascent, the one that collectible enthusiasts are increasingly exploring. This is part of the rationale behind our second quarter acquisition of KnownOrigin. KnownOrigin is an NFT platform that enables artists and collectors to create, buy and resell NFTs via blockchain-supported transactions. Their team is highly talented and has extensive technical experience in this rapidly evolving space. They were one of the early pioneers of NFTs and are a perfect fit to make eBay the destination to collect and trade. In the second quarter, we also began to experiment with Live Commerce. Although Western market adoption of live shopping remains low, we are optimizing our user experience ahead of this emerging trend. Early pilots have seen users engage, on average, for 15 minutes at a time with approximately 1/4 of them interacting directly with the event. We will continue to optimize this capability in future quarters. The Vault, NFTs and Live Commerce were all long-term strategic opportunities that we mentioned at Investor Day, and I'm pleased that in a few short months, we are already making progress in these areas. Customers are also seeing rapid improvements in payments capabilities where we continue to build out new services for sellers and buyers. For example, we rolled out additional forms of payment popular with German buyers, especially Gen Z. Through our partnership with Klarna, consumers can now pay upon invoice or in installments. We also expanded our Buyer FX program, which allows eBay buyers to purchase in the currency of their choice. Recently, we expanded this global service from 8 currencies to over 30 currencies. To date, we have seen over 60% adoption on related transactions. These new services are reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers while delivering incremental revenue to eBay. Advertising is also driving growth through innovation. Despite the macro environment, ad rates and adoption continue to grow due to the high return on ad spend that seller's experience on eBay. In Q2, our ads business accelerated faster than volume and delivered revenue that was nearly 1.5% of GMV. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue to $232 million, up 6%. This was 20 points faster than GMV growth. Our largest product, Standard Promoted Listings, grew in the quarter due to conversion optimization and pricing changes. Our 3 newer advertising products that we launched last year grew almost 30% versus Q1. The largest contributor was Promoted Listings Advanced, which saw increased seller adoption and exposure. Our advertising business remains on track with the long-term goals we outlined at Investor Day, and we anticipate that Promoted Listings will return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. ESG is a major focus for the eBay team. And during the quarter, we made steady progress on our commitments in this space. Recommerce continues to be a huge volume driver on eBay. As we've shared before, non-new and season inventory is driving the vast majority of volume on the platform. In particular, demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories. And we are well positioned to hit our long-term recommerce goals. eBay has a tremendous impact on the economy beyond our own results. As mentioned in our most recent impact report, in the U.S. alone, eBay supports more than 1 million jobs. The vast majority of these jobs come from small and micro business entrepreneurs selling on the platform. Another meaningful economic impact comes from the generosity of our community. eBay for Charity allows sellers and buyers to make a positive difference in the world. During the quarter, eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, up 52% year-over-year. And Q2 marked the Final Power of One Charity Auction with Warren Buffett, raising over $19 million. Over almost two decades, these auctions have raised more than $53 million for GLIDE, a nationally recognized center for equity. I'm truly inspired by the continued generosity powered by our marketplace. Finally, the team and I are honored to have received multiple prestigious awards this quarter. We were recognized as one of LinkedIn's top companies in retail, and we received 3 Women's Choice Awards in the consumer Internet category, Best companies for Diversity, Best Companies for Women and Best Companies for Millennials. I am proud to be in a team that focuses so heavily on the impact we are making in the lives of our employees, our customers and our communities. In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We delivered better-than-expected short-term results while marking several important milestones towards our long-term vision. GMV, revenue and EPS for Q2 all exceeded consensus estimates. Focus categories outperformed the rest of the marketplace by nine points, excluding trading cars. We maintained high NPS scores from enthusiast buyers who spend more per buyer. Coverage extended to more refurbished products and new categories like Joy. The eBay Vault, a game-changing capability that will enable the future of collecting. We acquired KnownOrigin to accelerate our connections between physical and digital. Our payments team scaled our Buyer FX capabilities, further simplifying frost currency transactions and rolled out Klarna to German customers. Our advertising business accelerated faster than volume, putting Promoted Listings on a trajectory to a double-digit growth in the coming quarters. And eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, including a record-breaking Power of One Auction with Warren Buffett. Before I hand over to Steve, I want to thank our amazing team who has continued to work hard innovating and exceptional experience for our customers around the world. They are delivering high-quality products and technologies that are translating into higher NPS scores and driving long-term growth for the company. To our sellers, thank you for continuing to partner with us. Your feedback is extremely valuable and helps us create trusted, reliable and frictionless experiences. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll show our outlook for the remainder of the year and add some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise. Overall, I'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering strong results amid some of the most challenging macroeconomic conditions in recent memory. Our Q2 GMV revenue and non-GAAP EPS each exceeded expectations and top the high end of our guidance range. Our second quarter revenue was down 6% to over $2.4 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 8 points due to contributions from payments and advertising. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down nearly 4 points sequentially due to volume deleverage and the seasonality of marketing spend. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.99 per share, in line with the prior year. And we generated $466 million of free cash flow and returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders to share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. Our strong Q2 results are a testament to the focus and dedication of our employees and the durability of our marketplace and financial model during periods of macro uncertainty. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance in Q2. Gross merchandise volume declined 14% as we like the elevated mobility restrictions in 2021. We also contended with a more challenging macro environment this year due to the conflict in Ukraine, ongoing supply chain challenges and rising inflation across our major markets. In spite of these headwinds, we saw volumes remain relatively stable as we progressed through the quarter, with GMV growing 5% versus our pre-COVID baseline in Q2 of 2019. We continue to scale our investments in long-term growth initiatives and observe proof points demonstrating our strategy is working. Excluding trading cards, focus categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by 9 points driven by the continued evolution of the product experience on eBay and growing awareness of our seller's unique high-quality inventory. Moving to active buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were $138 million during the quarter, down roughly $4 million sequentially due to the lapping of mobility restrictions during 2021. We announced the wind down of our Turkey business in June, which contributed nearly 4 million active buyers in Q1. These buyers would gradually roll off our total count over the next few quarters. Excluding Turkey, active buyers would have been 135 million in Q2. Importantly, disclosure will not materially impact our financials moving forward. Consumed gas buyers made up approximately $17 million of our active buyers in Q2. As we noted at Investor Day, we expected some movement between the enthusiasts and mid-value buyers in 2022 due to the lapping of elevated spending from mobility restrictions and stimulus last year. Notably, over 99% of last quarter's enthusiasts continue to be active buyers on eBay, of those buyers migrating downward, the vast majority remains in our mid-value group, only between $200 and $800 per year. And importantly, average spend among enthusiast buyers grew sequentially remains over $3,000 annually, up double digits versus 2019, demonstrating the robust demand among this lower group of eBay shoppers. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV grew 15% compared to Q2 of 2019, while international GMV was down 3% over the same time period. The growth differential between our U.S. and international markets was exacerbated by recent macro and geopolitical developments as our European markets have been more meaningfully impacted given their proximity to Ukraine. The U.S. also benefited from stronger economic growth, leading up to the Ukraine conflict, while our international markets were more exposed to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. Encouragingly, our focus categories are outperforming the rest of the marketplace on a global basis, demonstrating our innovation playbook is working across regions, although the level of outperformance is slightly higher in the U.S. due to the timing of launches and the relative category mix. Turning to revenue. Net revenue in Q2 was over $2.4 billion, down 6% due to the lapping of mobility restrictions last year and the intensity to macro headwinds over the last few months. However, revenue at past GMV growth of roughly eight points due to positive contributions from payments and advertising. As a result, our transaction take rate increased to 12.4% versus 12.1% in Q1. Total advertising revenue grew 4%, while first-party ads grew 6%, outpacing volume by approximately 20 points. This represents an acceleration versus Q1 driven by continued optimization of our standard Promoted Listings product, the growing scale, adoption and sophistication of our newer ad products and healthy returns on ad spend across our portfolio. We are extremely pleased with the momentum in our ads business and expect Promoted Listings revenue to return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. Managed payments contributed roughly 4 points of revenue growth during the quarter. Payments revenue remained comfortably above a $2 billion run rate despite recent volume pressure as new services like buyer and seller FX are scaled in line with expectations. These new payment services remain on track to achieve a $300 million revenue target we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.7% in Q2, down roughly four points sequentially, primarily driven by top line deleverage and the advancement of our full federal marketing strategy. We also continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our focus categories and horizontal marketplace improvements. Our G&A expense includes exit costs related to the wind down of our Turkey business, which offset lower employee-related costs in the quarter. We delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in Q2, which was in line with our prior year and above our outlook for the quarter. The lapping of COVID-driven volume tailwinds in the prior year was offset by cost efficiencies, better-than-expected volume and the net benefit of share repurchase during the quarter. A portion of the EPS upside was driven by the timing of our expense run. We continue to invest in our long-term plan despite the short-term macro uncertainty. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.96 primarily driven by losses in our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility. Turning to capital allocation. We generated $466 million of free cash flow in Q2 by nearly 50% due to the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration and lower volume versus the prior year. We ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $4.5 billion, along with gross debt of $7.7 billion after redeeming $605 million of notes during the second quarter. We repurchased $1.3 billion of shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q2 and have more than $3.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $121 million in June or $0.22 per share. Our repurchase have reduced outstanding shares by roughly $45 million over the last 2 quarters net of dilution. Despite the dynamic macro environment, we remain balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. For launch of the eBay vault, our investments in Funko, the acquisition of KnownOrigin and our PSA authentication partnership are a few recent examples of our build by partner framework, helping us to accomplish strategic objectives. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20. Equity investment stakes were valued at approximately $4 billion at the end of Q2. We sold roughly $370 million in aggregate of Kakao Bank and Adyen shares during the second quarter, while market volatility impacted the value of our remaining stake. We'll continue to manage our investment portfolio with an intent of maximizing shareholder value. You'll see additional detail on our share sales and remaining investment holdings in our 10-Q. Moving on to our outlook. Our business has remained resilient in recent months despite escalating macro headwinds, but the operating environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. The spread of COVID variants, persistent supply chain issues, elevated inflation and the impact of rising interest rates will likely wear on consumers' discussional spend for some time. The duration and severity of the economic impact from the Ukraine war and related sanctions are even more challenging to anticipate. Given our outperformance in Q2, relatively stable volume trends as we progress through the quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for an FX-neutral GMV decline between 12% and 10% for the full year. While we land in that range, we'll likely be determined by whether the current macro headwinds of study, intensify or subside. Additionally, recent currency movements relate to an incremental FX headwind of roughly $500 million to 2022 GMV versus our prior outlook. On a spot basis, our guidance translates to full year GMV between $72.7 million to $74.7 billion. Our hedging plan should help us mitigate the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS. Our revenue outlook for 2022 remains unchanged of between $9.6 billion and $9.9 billion, represents an FX-neutral decline of between 6% and 3% or 6 or 7 points faster than volume growth. We also maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of between 29% and 30% for the full year. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $3.95 and $4.10, raising the low end of our prior range by $0.05. Looking to Q3 guidance. We actually generate between $17 billion and $17.6 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of between 9% and 6%. We anticipate revenue between $2.29 billion and $2.37 billion or a decline of between 5% and 2%. We forecast a non-GAAP operating margin of between 27% and 28% as we continue to invest in our marketing and product experience initiatives to support focus categories and horizontal marketplace innovation. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.89 and $0.95, representing growth of negative 1% and positive 6%. In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations across all key financial metrics despite facing challenging macro headwinds in recent months. Our fortress balance sheet and durable financial model put us in a fortunate position to continue investing in long-term growth while delivering robust earnings and free cash flow amidst an uncertain macro environment. eBay's track record of shareholder-friendly capital allocation continued as we returned over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and cash dividends this quarter. Our advertising and payments teams continue to innovate with new services and capabilities, which are driving revenue in excess of volume growth at healthy incremental margins. And I'm particularly proud of our team's focus and financial discipline, which has enabled us to remain on track to reach our ambitious impact goals and climate reduction targets during this period of economic uncertainty. Fostering sustainable business practices and enabling equitable inclusive entrepreneurship have never been more important than they are today. Finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated eBay employees to continuously striving to deliver a better future for our customers, our global community and our planet. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Just maybe start with the macro. I guess this one is for Steve. So your full year GMV growth, ex FX, hasn't changed from the last quarterly call despite what looks like fairly meaningful deterioration for consumers in Germany and U.K. from what we heard from a lot of other companies. So maybe could you just help us with what you saw in terms of linearity throughout 2Q? What you're seeing thus far in 3Q? What you baked into the second half GMV growth? And then a question we often get from folks is, how much of your GMV is discretionary versus what would be considered maybe nondiscretionary? Any help with that would be great.\nStephen Priest: Yes. I'll take that one. First of all, I wanted to say how pleased I am with both the results and the execution of eBay during the second quarter, as I stated in the prepared comments. As you would imagine, as we look to the rest of the year, we've been very thoughtful about the guide and obviously take into account of the current environment. As I think about it, there's 3 significant considerations that we've taken into account and expect to continue throughout the rest of 2022. The first being the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has a disproportionate impact on the European business because of the proximity to Ukraine and the pressure on energy prices. Secondly, the supply chain constraints, which are having an impact on our cross-border trade. And again, we expect those to prevail through the rest of the year. And then thirdly, just really thinking about the broader macro backdrop where we're seeing elevated inflation, rising interest rates, which are having associated impacts on consumer discretionary spend that are all putting pressure. As we consider that, we've put a broader range than we ordinarily would do in the second half of the year to take account of those three significant items. And ultimately, we land within our guidance range will be determined how that macro environment and those macro headwinds evolve over the second half, whether they hold steady, whether they intensify or indeed whether they subside. With regards to the specific areas versus GMV, we obviously have a very global and significant business across the globe. We don't have grocery. We don\u2019t have no material FMCG, and so there's a broad-based of countries. So I wouldn't point to any specific area that would stand out for me. Perhaps, Jamie, if you've got anything that you'd like to add.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. I think it's hard to differentiate discretionary versus nondiscretionary. I think if you go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we had 5 -- we have five big areas over $10 billion. So obviously, when times are tough, people trade down, and that's where kind of our Refurb is helping out, et cetera. So hard to kind of pull that out. But I would say, as Steve said, it's -- we don't have grocery or material FMCG on the site.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nNikhil Devnani: Nice to see the Q2 margin beat. Can you just talk about what got better in the quarter versus your expectations? Was there any delay of certain investments that are now taking place in the third quarter? Or did you realize incremental efficiency gains there? And then as a second question, how are you thinking about focus category growth going forward relative to the rest of the GMV base?\nStephen Priest: Nikhil, I'll pick up the first part, and then Jamie perhaps can pick up the second. With regard to the second quarter, as you would anticipate, we continue to lean in in terms of operational efficiencies in the short term while we do continue to invest for the long term to drive that long-term sustainable growth that we talked about at our investor event back in March. Candidly, it's really an effect of timing. We had expected some incremental ramp of expenditure as we went through with those investments in the second quarter. Some of that will ramp in the third quarter. And that's why you've seen us hold our full year margin guidance intact for the full year. Jamie, perhaps you'd like to cover the focus categories question.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, we're pleased with the outperformance of focus categories being 9 points above the rest of the business. Importantly, we're continuing to invest. We rolled out jewelry this quarter with a partnership with GIA for jewelry over $500. We expanded what we're doing in handbags, launching that in Germany, bringing accessories, things like wallets in the U.S., expanded Refurb to additional categories, headphones audio, gaming console, smart home devices. So we're continuing to invest in our focus categories. As I've always said, it's not a won and done. I mean if you think about the launch of vault and the incremental authentication that we've launched in collectibles, that was a category we started on as a focus category more than a year ago. So we're going to continue to innovate both on the existing ones that are there and launch new ones like we did with jewelry this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: I just want to follow up on focus categories and ask about the vault, which recently launched. I know it's early, but just curious how consumer reaction has been so far and what engagement has looked like and just how you're thinking about kind of monetization there going forward.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So it's early days, as you said, but we're excited by the initial feedback from the early customers. So it's having the intended impact, which is giving them a frictionless way to buy and sell on the platform to encourage sellers to use it because, obviously, there's a first-mover advantage. We think once the product is in the vault. It's unlikely to move to a different vault or there can be withdrawal. So we reduced fees through the end of the year on things like storage and selling fees in order to encourage adoption. And we're kind of right on track with where we thought. We're going to continue to innovate, add more categories and add more products over time, but a good early start to the program.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Good, of course, to see the progress here on the platform. Jim, I know you've been asked this before, but just reflecting on the past quarter, last few months, do you think the marketplace is benefiting all from consumers trading down a bit just given the pressures on the pocketbook right now sort of that countercyclical benefit? And then, Steve, you mentioned growing awareness on the platform. And I'm just curious how you're evaluating that. Is there data you're looking at in things like traffic to the site or other signals that might not yet be showing up in volume monetization that we might expect to see down the line a bit?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So on the first one on the kind of countercyclical, I'm really happy we refocused the strategy towards non-new and season 2.5 years ago because it is -- we're leaning into opportunities of where the consumer can be and makes the platform more resilient. So we are seeing strength in things like our refurbished category where consumers can trade down. And frankly, just the value of eBay of having non-new and season makes the platform a little bit more resilient. Over time as well selling is important in tough times for consumers because, as I've said all along, they've got $4,000 of stuff in the house that they could sell, and they -- less than 20% of that is online. So we're essentially working to kind of lean into both. On your question on awareness around our spend, we do look at everything, buyers traffic and seller. But 1 thing we measure pretty religiously is kind of initial consideration of what we're doing. So what you see us do is shift from doing a lot of lower funnel to more full-funnel marketing. I think about us being at the New York parts, Joe, what we're doing in collectibles with the MLB All-Star games. Next week, you'll see us launch a program in the U.K. with Pimp My Ride, which is really focused on our parts and accessories and being where enthusiasts are. And what we're really doing there is focusing on eBay and initial consideration set and really talking about the value propositions that we're building through focus categories. And what I'd say is we're excited about the initial results and the early movements in ICS in the campaigns that we're running.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: So Jamie, trading cards have -- obviously, we received all the investor attention perhaps within collectibles, but is there anything you can highlight in terms of other potential collectibles categories where you can start bringing the higher focus and perhaps the vault offering, maybe stamps or corns or comic books or other things and what the potential size of some of those other categories might be? And I guess, secondarily, on KnownOrigin, I guess, granted this is definitely one for the mid- to longer term, but it's our understanding that there have been platforms out there that allow for trading of digital goods, primarily probably more with video game and in-game items. And those have been in existence for some time, and this seems to have been an area where eBay has really never felt the need to participate. So why is now the right time to enter this vertical?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So I'd say a couple of things. First, on the collectibles business, yes, we've leaned in a lot to trading cards because of the opportunity that we see in that market. But if you go back to Investor Day, where we size the collectibles business, it's over a $10 billion category. So there's lots of different elements in there and, frankly, lots of different elements geographically. So there's things stronger in our U.K. and German business where trading cards is more of a U.S. phenomenon from that perspective because collecting is interesting regionally, although there is a good amount of cross-border trade when it comes to collectibles. So we're going to continue to invest in collectibles and broadly as a category. On KnownOrigin, it's really -- a key part of that is the talent that we're bringing in. If you look at the team there, they're really the founding -- some of the founding pioneers and the early work around NFTs and digital. And so bringing that directly into eBay, I think, really helps us as we think about the intersection of physical and digital, some of the pieces that Jordan outlined at Investor Day because eBay has been always the place where people go to collect things. And so being able to figure out how to bring them on to the platform, I think, is a key advantage. I'd say it's really early days, but I think we found a great amazing team that we're integrating into the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Going back to the Analyst Day, you guys talked about the ability to continue to sort of innovate around the marketing platform for yourselves over the medium to long term. Any update on how you're thinking about advertising solutions continuing to innovate and change on the platform for sellers? And how we should be thinking about investments versus the cadence of rollout of some of those potential products in the quarters ahead?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. And I assume when you mean advertising solutions, you mean what we're doing to bring traffic to the site, not the advertising product on the site. So on the marketing side, yes, we've absolutely been doing a shift both kind of moving more towards mid-funnel, going after more paid social younger demographics in terms of what we're doing with TikTok and those types of programs. And we've been enhancing what we're doing from a marketing perspective, rolling out a new marketing technology, we call it user experience platform, to help us be much more efficient with that. As it relates to specifically to sellers, I'd point to 2 things. First is the investments that we're making in external Promoted Listings. So having sellers that are in our Promoted Listings product, be able to generate specific traffic to their business. And then the second thing is all the work that we've done over the last probably 18 months around eBay stores, about letting them build the brand in the marketplace, about letting them incorporate videos into their experience, around letting them spend coupons to interested or repeat buyers in the platform because we see this twofold. One is being able to drive traffic there but also helping them drive their repeat business on eBay, which is why we've been making those investments. Also, we think it's really critical to our second pillar being the seller platform of choice. So we're going to continue to push forward on those types of innovations on behalf of our sellers.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Jamie, it sounds like you're seeing steady send out of the active buyers. Just curious how you grade your ability to migrate mid-tier buyers more into the active category. And then, Steve, to cherrypick one macro factor, curious if you could talk about the recent decline in gas prices. And maybe any moderation in inflation? Curious if you're seeing any demand elasticities here as potentially inflation moderates in some areas.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So we're excited by what we're seeing in terms of spend per buyer. So we -- if you look at -- versus 2019, our spend per buyer for enthusiast buyers are actually up double digits. And that ties right into what we're doing from a focus category strategy. The second thing that we're really focused on is that multiplier effect that we talked about at Investor Day, the fact that watches buyer will come in and spend $8,000 in watches, but $9,000 in the rest of the site, a parts buyer will buy $500, but then buy $700 outside of that. And that helps us drive the strategy around what we -- what we're going after with enthusiast buyers and spend per buyer. It's also why we changed our marketing programs to be much more targeted at acquiring enthusiast buyers. Steve, do you want to cover the second one?\nStephen Priest: Yes. Of course. Tom, Nice to speak to you. What I would say is we are a truly global business with size and scale, Tom. And obviously, as we think about the globe, the impact of cost order that I've talked about, particularly our got Chinese, think about Europe being more significantly here with energy prices, particularly associated with gas prices going up. And so your point about slightly moderating gas prices perhaps over here, a lot of choppiness on inflation. We're not seeing anything in particular would identify any changes to what we've laid out.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. I'd just add that when I talk to our eBayers in Germany and U.K., they get their gas bills twice a year, in some cases, once a year. And definitely, there's the impact there of that. And I think that's part of why we see a bigger impact on our European business than we -- our international business than we do in the Americas.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lauren Schenk with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nLauren Schenk: Great. I just wanted to ask about the marketing has been in the quarter was sort of higher than, I think, we were all expecting. Just how do I marry that with maybe the weaker-than-expected customer net adds as well? And then how you're thinking about marketing somewhat broadly in the back half of the year? Is that somewhere that you would pull back if the macro does deteriorate further?\nStephen Priest: Lauren, I'll pick that one up. It's really a function of seasonality when you sort of look at where we are. And I think I'd bifurcate the two. One is the marketing spend, which is a function of season by quarter. And then secondly, when I think about buyers, it's a trailing 12-month metric. Obviously, we're lapping through the pandemic from last year. We're dealing with a sort of greater macro environment. So we bifurcate the two and so there's nothing specific that I'd point to in terms of the linkage between the two areas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: The revenues are definitely 4 points better than GMV in the Q3 guidance. How do you think about that differential as payments ramps up towards 100%? And can you maintain a nice differential there looking forward after 3Q? And then the second question -- just hedging looks like it's helping a little bit this year. How much is it helping? It might be in some disclosure, I didn't see. And is that going to be helpful in '23? Or is there a time frame that we should be thinking about hedging helping you?\nStephen Priest: Justin, I'll pick those up. So I'm really pleased with the level of execution that we've seen both in terms of our ads business and payments business. And so as Jamie alluded to in his prepared comments, we're seeing a 20% delta between advertising and volume in the second quarter. And the payments team has done a tremendous job executing items like Buyer FX, additional forms of payments that continue to add potential for the revenue side to eBay. We are sort of lapping through as we're coming off the back of the payments migration that was completed in quarter 4 last year. So we are seeing some of the upside around that. But if I reflect on the second quarter, we had about an 8-point delta between GMV and revenue pretty much split evenly between advertising and payments, a little bit more pressure going forward as we see lap to that dynamic. With regards to your questions around hedging, the team did a very nice job of obviously hedging OI and EPS. Our GMV, obviously, is unhedged. And we are seeing pressure because of the strength of the dollar versus sterling and euro over recent months. And that's why you've seen an implied $500 million impact on our GMV guide at a spot rate as we've gone forward. But the teams diligently work hedging OI and EPS as we go forward. And we go quarter by quarter, year by year. I'm not sure that we get the balance side as we do that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Zack [ph] on for Deepak. Just curious on your ad business. You saw some reacceleration in the quarter. Just curious for an update on some of these newer product initiatives, Express and Advanced. Kind of can you just give us an update there in terms of adoption? Is this kind of a key driver of the reacceleration? Or is it just still kind of broader adoption of the standard Promoter listing product? And then second, on the kind of monetization of some of your investments. Just curious for how you're thinking about the Adevinta stake here. You've been kind of monetizing some of the other assets over the past couple of quarters. I know a good chunk of it is kind of locked up until end of next year, but just kind of any updated thoughts and philosophy on the Adevinta specifically?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So first, on the Ad Business Act, we tend to provide a really good rollout for our sellers. So there's still a lot of penetration opportunity in our Promoted Listing standard product and driving incremental adoption for more sellers across more listings, et cetera. But we're pleased this quarter to really start seeing some traction in our newest products. As I talked about on the call, our newest products are up 30% quarter-on-quarter, which is great to see. This will lead to Promoted Listings that's double digit in the coming quarters. And I just -- of the 3 new products, I'd highlight Advanced, I think, as a significant opportunity for us because of the monetization that it provides and because we still have a good ways to go in terms of driving adoption on the platform. I'd just say it's a continual dial and frank in terms of optimizing the buyer experience, the tools that we have and the algorithms to make sure that we're not degrading buyer experience. We're enhancing it and continue to provide a return on ad sales. But I'm happy to see the 1.5% penetration we got to this quarter. And like I said, the future quarters should allow us to drive double-digit growth. Steve, do you want to take the second one on...\nStephen Priest: Absolutely. So we continue to be very balanced and thoughtful about capital allocation. We've got a long track record of creating and maximizing long-term shareholder value as we've gone through that. As you're probably aware, in the second quarter, we divested some of our holdings in Adyen and Kakao. Specifically, with regards to your question around Adevinta, we have 33% stake. Indeed, 25% of that is tied up until later in 2023. We continue to reflect on our investments, whether we believe we can generate incremental value in the short term by selling them or holding on for a little longer to continue to drive that shareholder value. So we reflect on all of our investments. We'll be very diligent about how we think about it to ultimately drive long-term shareholder returns.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Blackledge: Two questions. First, on eBay Live, could you kind of discuss the early learnings engagement and how we should think about this program ramping as we head towards the fourth quarter and the holiday season? And then secondly, a follow-up on advertising. You've mentioned Promoted Listings reaccelerating to 10%-plus growth. Any update there on timing for when it gets back to double digits?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So on eBay Live, our live shopping pilot, I would say it's early, John. We're kind of in the test phase of that. And it's really about learning about how eBay engages the best way to get customers engaged. I would say from our early test that we're excited by what we saw both in terms of the time people were engaged, to engage 15 minutes in a video, especially with today's attention span of consumers, and the interaction. We had a quarter of people like interacting with the experience. So we feel really good about what it can be. As you've seen from a macro standpoint, it's had a lot more traction in the Asia region than it has here. It's still much more of a nascent technology, but first as well with some of the categories like some of the other pilots that we have. So I'd just say very early testing and learning at this stage. On advertising, what we talked about is getting to a double-digit growth in the coming quarters, and we feel comfortable about our plans to do that really on the strength of our core product and standard and on the growth that we're seeing out of our new products.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: You guys laid out, I think, some helpful and ambitious long-term targets for GMV growth at your Analyst Day. I guess how do you think about how the current macro environment impacts the timing by which you guys look to achieve these goals? And then maybe on parts and accessories specifically, can you provide any update on how the playbook is rolling out across this category? Have you started to see the return on investment, whereby you're getting accelerated growth across these categories given what you've done over the last couple of quarters in parts and accessories?\nStephen Priest: Lee, I'll take the longer-term plan question. We obviously updated the market at our Investor Day back in March, and our long-term guidance remains unchanged. We are continuing to execute, whether it's through the focus category playbook, ads, payments, building, broader trust on the platform and driving CSAT. So I'm really pleased what we've been seeing quarter after quarter and the levels of execution that we're seeing with the team. Undoubtedly, we are navigating a particularly challenging macro environment, which we believe is transitory. And so the way that we think about this is a duration and the severity of the current macro environment will really point to the timing to the medium-term proportion in GMV, but we continue to be very aligned and confident about the long-term trajectory that we laid out on our Investor Day, specifically to do with parts and accessories, Jamie?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. We're really pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the rollouts on parts and accessories. I'd say both from a marketing standpoint. So we're getting aggressive in our key markets about driving an initial consideration set. I talked earlier about some of the stuff we're doing with sponsorship of Pimp My Ride. We did the same thing with eBay Auto Parts Show in New York. Those types of things led to 3 billion media impressions for us from that standpoint. And as I talked about, really going after that enthusiasts, leaning into things like I was just out in our European markets. And their certified green parts are incredibly important, and we continue to add more of that supply onto the marketplace. And then secondarily, I'd just say on the product side, improvements in fitment, improvements in the organization of the inventory and the collaboration is important. We enhance some of the AI that powers our search and our merchandising and our advertising really around this idea of fitment and how to make sure that we have 100% trust and the fitment on the product. So we're excited about what we're seeing and the results, the movement that we're seeing in initial consideration set. And we're not going to be done. This is going to be a category that we're going to continue to innovate on quarter after quarter.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Your line is open.\nRichard Kramer: Sorry, I was on mute. Jamie, my question is as follows. I'm a little surprised by the comparisons to 2019. I guess my question is, are you looking back at the pandemic period and thinking that some of the changes that we saw in consumer behavior are now getting reversed? And given how much you've talked about focus categories, should investors expect a further retreat from general merchandise, especially given how difficult the economic backdrop is? And maybe one quick one for Steve. Could you reflect a little bit on the cost base and the execution culture at eBay? We've seen the live shopping is still in beta. Off-site ads are still in beta. It seems like things are taking time to get out to full general availability. Is it something that you think is requiring more investment in the short term and it's worth it just to make sure that you actually get some of these new initiatives up and running?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So on the first one, part of the reason why we look at '19 is just the massive acceleration that we saw over the COVID time period and kind of comparing the pre and post with the massive restriction and mobility and the stimulus that was there in the market. Obviously, we believe we're definitely coming out of the pandemic much stronger than we came into it. And our strategy is working. To your question on focus categories, our focus category strategy is really focused on non-new and season. So we've kind of really moved away from new and season. You can still obviously buy it on the site, and we have that product. But we're leaning into where eBay is strong. If I go back to the Investor Day, it's a $1.1 trillion TAM growing to $1.4 trillion. And we think given the tougher economic times right now, our strategy of where we're focusing from that category standpoint is exactly where we need to be, and it's frankly a strength for eBay. Do you want to take the third one, Steve?\nStephen Priest: Yes. Richard, I'd make a few comments. First of all, I think on a broader cost structure, the teams have been incredibly diligent, particularly as we cycle through this macro environment. And that creates capacity for us to invest in the long term. And everybody at eBay is looking through that lens. Secondly, I really believe the pace of innovation is moving much quicker than it was prepandemic. We talked about the speed of innovation and focus categories and what we're doing there. Think about the execution and payments and the say-do ratio that we talked about at Investor Day and then the growth that we see in our advertising business. Thirdly, I would say that I'm delighted that Eddie Garcia is back at eBay, heading at the product organization and bringing his wealth of experience, years of experience to the team to really drive best-in-class products for us here. So we remain very optimistic about the future ahead of us, and I'm really pleased with the execution of the team.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephen Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll show our outlook for the remainder of the year and add some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I announce otherwise. Overall, I'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering strong results amid some of the most challenging macroeconomic conditions in recent memory. Our Q2 GMV revenue and non-GAAP EPS each exceeded expectations and top the high end of our guidance range. Our second quarter revenue was down 6% to over $2.4 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 8 points due to contributions from payments and advertising. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down nearly 4 points sequentially due to volume deleverage and the seasonality of marketing spend. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.99 per share, in line with the prior year. And we generated $466 million of free cash flow and returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders to share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. Our strong Q2 results are a testament to the focus and dedication of our employees and the durability of our marketplace and financial model during periods of macro uncertainty. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of our financial performance in Q2. Gross merchandise volume declined 14% as we like the elevated mobility restrictions in 2021. We also contended with a more challenging macro environment this year due to the conflict in Ukraine, ongoing supply chain challenges and rising inflation across our major markets. In spite of these headwinds, we saw volumes remain relatively stable as we progressed through the quarter, with GMV growing 5% versus our pre-COVID baseline in Q2 of 2019. We continue to scale our investments in long-term growth initiatives and observe proof points demonstrating our strategy is working. Excluding trading cards, focus categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by 9 points driven by the continued evolution of the product experience on eBay and growing awareness of our seller's unique high-quality inventory. Moving to active buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were $138 million during the quarter, down roughly $4 million sequentially due to the lapping of mobility restrictions during 2021. We announced the wind down of our Turkey business in June, which contributed nearly 4 million active buyers in Q1. These buyers would gradually roll off our total count over the next few quarters. Excluding Turkey, active buyers would have been 135 million in Q2. Importantly, disclosure will not materially impact our financials moving forward. Consumed gas buyers made up approximately $17 million of our active buyers in Q2. As we noted at Investor Day, we expected some movement between the enthusiasts and mid-value buyers in 2022 due to the lapping of elevated spending from mobility restrictions and stimulus last year. Notably, over 99% of last quarter's enthusiasts continue to be active buyers on eBay, of those buyers migrating downward, the vast majority remains in our mid-value group, only between $200 and $800 per year. And importantly, average spend among enthusiast buyers grew sequentially remains over $3,000 annually, up double digits versus 2019, demonstrating the robust demand among this lower group of eBay shoppers. Looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV grew 15% compared to Q2 of 2019, while international GMV was down 3% over the same time period. The growth differential between our U.S. and international markets was exacerbated by recent macro and geopolitical developments as our European markets have been more meaningfully impacted given their proximity to Ukraine. The U.S. also benefited from stronger economic growth, leading up to the Ukraine conflict, while our international markets were more exposed to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. Encouragingly, our focus categories are outperforming the rest of the marketplace on a global basis, demonstrating our innovation playbook is working across regions, although the level of outperformance is slightly higher in the U.S. due to the timing of launches and the relative category mix. Turning to revenue. Net revenue in Q2 was over $2.4 billion, down 6% due to the lapping of mobility restrictions last year and the intensity to macro headwinds over the last few months. However, revenue at past GMV growth of roughly eight points due to positive contributions from payments and advertising. As a result, our transaction take rate increased to 12.4% versus 12.1% in Q1. Total advertising revenue grew 4%, while first-party ads grew 6%, outpacing volume by approximately 20 points. This represents an acceleration versus Q1 driven by continued optimization of our standard Promoted Listings product, the growing scale, adoption and sophistication of our newer ad products and healthy returns on ad spend across our portfolio. We are extremely pleased with the momentum in our ads business and expect Promoted Listings revenue to return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. Managed payments contributed roughly 4 points of revenue growth during the quarter. Payments revenue remained comfortably above a $2 billion run rate despite recent volume pressure as new services like buyer and seller FX are scaled in line with expectations. These new payment services remain on track to achieve a $300 million revenue target we discussed at our Investor Day. Moving to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 28.7% in Q2, down roughly four points sequentially, primarily driven by top line deleverage and the advancement of our full federal marketing strategy. We also continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our focus categories and horizontal marketplace improvements. Our G&A expense includes exit costs related to the wind down of our Turkey business, which offset lower employee-related costs in the quarter. We delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in Q2, which was in line with our prior year and above our outlook for the quarter. The lapping of COVID-driven volume tailwinds in the prior year was offset by cost efficiencies, better-than-expected volume and the net benefit of share repurchase during the quarter. A portion of the EPS upside was driven by the timing of our expense run. We continue to invest in our long-term plan despite the short-term macro uncertainty. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $0.96 primarily driven by losses in our investment portfolio due to ongoing market volatility. Turning to capital allocation. We generated $466 million of free cash flow in Q2 by nearly 50% due to the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration and lower volume versus the prior year. We ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $4.5 billion, along with gross debt of $7.7 billion after redeeming $605 million of notes during the second quarter. We repurchased $1.3 billion of shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q2 and have more than $3.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $121 million in June or $0.22 per share. Our repurchase have reduced outstanding shares by roughly $45 million over the last 2 quarters net of dilution. Despite the dynamic macro environment, we remain balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. For launch of the eBay vault, our investments in Funko, the acquisition of KnownOrigin and our PSA authentication partnership are a few recent examples of our build by partner framework, helping us to accomplish strategic objectives. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20. Equity investment stakes were valued at approximately $4 billion at the end of Q2. We sold roughly $370 million in aggregate of Kakao Bank and Adyen shares during the second quarter, while market volatility impacted the value of our remaining stake. We'll continue to manage our investment portfolio with an intent of maximizing shareholder value. You'll see additional detail on our share sales and remaining investment holdings in our 10-Q. Moving on to our outlook. Our business has remained resilient in recent months despite escalating macro headwinds, but the operating environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict. The spread of COVID variants, persistent supply chain issues, elevated inflation and the impact of rising interest rates will likely wear on consumers' discussional spend for some time. The duration and severity of the economic impact from the Ukraine war and related sanctions are even more challenging to anticipate. Given our outperformance in Q2, relatively stable volume trends as we progress through the quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for an FX-neutral GMV decline between 12% and 10% for the full year. While we land in that range, we'll likely be determined by whether the current macro headwinds of study, intensify or subside. Additionally, recent currency movements relate to an incremental FX headwind of roughly $500 million to 2022 GMV versus our prior outlook. On a spot basis, our guidance translates to full year GMV between $72.7 million to $74.7 billion. Our hedging plan should help us mitigate the incremental FX impact to revenue, operating income and EPS. Our revenue outlook for 2022 remains unchanged of between $9.6 billion and $9.9 billion, represents an FX-neutral decline of between 6% and 3% or 6 or 7 points faster than volume growth. We also maintain our non-GAAP operating margin target of between 29% and 30% for the full year. We now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $3.95 and $4.10, raising the low end of our prior range by $0.05. Looking to Q3 guidance. We actually generate between $17 billion and $17.6 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of between 9% and 6%. We anticipate revenue between $2.29 billion and $2.37 billion or a decline of between 5% and 2%. We forecast a non-GAAP operating margin of between 27% and 28% as we continue to invest in our marketing and product experience initiatives to support focus categories and horizontal marketplace innovation. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.89 and $0.95, representing growth of negative 1% and positive 6%. In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations across all key financial metrics despite facing challenging macro headwinds in recent months. Our fortress balance sheet and durable financial model put us in a fortunate position to continue investing in long-term growth while delivering robust earnings and free cash flow amidst an uncertain macro environment. eBay's track record of shareholder-friendly capital allocation continued as we returned over $1.4 billion through share repurchases and cash dividends this quarter. Our advertising and payments teams continue to innovate with new services and capabilities, which are driving revenue in excess of volume growth at healthy incremental margins. And I'm particularly proud of our team's focus and financial discipline, which has enabled us to remain on track to reach our ambitious impact goals and climate reduction targets during this period of economic uncertainty. Fostering sustainable business practices and enabling equitable inclusive entrepreneurship have never been more important than they are today. Finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated eBay employees to continuously striving to deliver a better future for our customers, our global community and our planet. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yes. I'll take that one. First of all, I wanted to say how pleased I am with both the results and the execution of eBay during the second quarter, as I stated in the prepared comments. As you would imagine, as we look to the rest of the year, we've been very thoughtful about the guide and obviously take into account of the current environment. As I think about it, there's 3 significant considerations that we've taken into account and expect to continue throughout the rest of 2022. The first being the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has a disproportionate impact on the European business because of the proximity to Ukraine and the pressure on energy prices. Secondly, the supply chain constraints, which are having an impact on our cross-border trade. And again, we expect those to prevail through the rest of the year. And then thirdly, just really thinking about the broader macro backdrop where we're seeing elevated inflation, rising interest rates, which are having associated impacts on consumer discretionary spend that are all putting pressure. As we consider that, we've put a broader range than we ordinarily would do in the second half of the year to take account of those three significant items. And ultimately, we land within our guidance range will be determined how that macro environment and those macro headwinds evolve over the second half, whether they hold steady, whether they intensify or indeed whether they subside. With regards to the specific areas versus GMV, we obviously have a very global and significant business across the globe. We don't have grocery. We don't have no material FMCG, and so there's a broad-based of countries. So I wouldn't point to any specific area that would stand out for me. Perhaps, Jamie, if you've got anything that you'd like to add. Nikhil, I'll pick up the first part, and then Jamie perhaps can pick up the second. With regard to the second quarter, as you would anticipate, we continue to lean in in terms of operational efficiencies in the short term while we do continue to invest for the long term to drive that long-term sustainable growth that we talked about at our investor event back in March. Candidly, it's really an effect of timing. We had expected some incremental ramp of expenditure as we went through with those investments in the second quarter. Some of that will ramp in the third quarter. And that's why you've seen us hold our full year margin guidance intact for the full year. Jamie, perhaps you'd like to cover the focus categories question. Yes. Of course. Tom, Nice to speak to you. What I would say is we are a truly global business with size and scale, Tom. And obviously, as we think about the globe, the impact of cost order that I've talked about, particularly our got Chinese, think about Europe being more significantly here with energy prices, particularly associated with gas prices going up. And so your point about slightly moderating gas prices perhaps over here, a lot of choppiness on inflation. We're not seeing anything in particular would identify any changes to what we've laid out. Lauren, I'll pick that one up. It's really a function of seasonality when you sort of look at where we are. And I think I'd bifurcate the two. One is the marketing spend, which is a function of season by quarter. And then secondly, when I think about buyers, it's a trailing 12-month metric. Obviously, we're lapping through the pandemic from last year. We're dealing with a sort of greater macro environment. So we bifurcate the two and so there's nothing specific that I'd point to in terms of the linkage between the two areas. Justin, I'll pick those up. So I'm really pleased with the level of execution that we've seen both in terms of our ads business and payments business. And so as Jamie alluded to in his prepared comments, we're seeing a 20% delta between advertising and volume in the second quarter. And the payments team has done a tremendous job executing items like Buyer FX, additional forms of payments that continue to add potential for the revenue side to eBay. We are sort of lapping through as we're coming off the back of the payments migration that was completed in quarter 4 last year. So we are seeing some of the upside around that. But if I reflect on the second quarter, we had about an 8-point delta between GMV and revenue pretty much split evenly between advertising and payments, a little bit more pressure going forward as we see lap to that dynamic. With regards to your questions around hedging, the team did a very nice job of obviously hedging OI and EPS. Our GMV, obviously, is unhedged. And we are seeing pressure because of the strength of the dollar versus sterling and euro over recent months. And that's why you've seen an implied $500 million impact on our GMV guide at a spot rate as we've gone forward. But the teams diligently work hedging OI and EPS as we go forward. And we go quarter by quarter, year by year. I'm not sure that we get the balance side as we do that. Absolutely. So we continue to be very balanced and thoughtful about capital allocation. We've got a long track record of creating and maximizing long-term shareholder value as we've gone through that. As you're probably aware, in the second quarter, we divested some of our holdings in Adyen and Kakao. Specifically, with regards to your question around Adevinta, we have 33% stake. Indeed, 25% of that is tied up until later in 2023. We continue to reflect on our investments, whether we believe we can generate incremental value in the short term by selling them or holding on for a little longer to continue to drive that shareholder value. So we reflect on all of our investments. We'll be very diligent about how we think about it to ultimately drive long-term shareholder returns. Lee, I'll take the longer-term plan question. We obviously updated the market at our Investor Day back in March, and our long-term guidance remains unchanged. We are continuing to execute, whether it's through the focus category playbook, ads, payments, building, broader trust on the platform and driving CSAT. So I'm really pleased what we've been seeing quarter after quarter and the levels of execution that we're seeing with the team. Undoubtedly, we are navigating a particularly challenging macro environment, which we believe is transitory. And so the way that we think about this is a duration and the severity of the current macro environment will really point to the timing to the medium-term proportion in GMV, but we continue to be very aligned and confident about the long-term trajectory that we laid out on our Investor Day, specifically to do with parts and accessories, Jamie? Yes. Richard, I'd make a few comments. First of all, I think on a broader cost structure, the teams have been incredibly diligent, particularly as we cycle through this macro environment. And that creates capacity for us to invest in the long term. And everybody at eBay is looking through that lens. Secondly, I really believe the pace of innovation is moving much quicker than it was prepandemic. We talked about the speed of innovation and focus categories and what we're doing there. Think about the execution and payments and the say-do ratio that we talked about at Investor Day and then the growth that we see in our advertising business. Thirdly, I would say that I'm delighted that Eddie Garcia is back at eBay, heading at the product organization and bringing his wealth of experience, years of experience to the team to really drive best-in-class products for us here. So we remain very optimistic about the future ahead of us, and I'm really pleased with the execution of the team."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier this year, during our Investor Day, we updated you on the progress of our Tech-Led Reimagination and outlined our vision for the future. I'm really excited about the pace at which our talented teams are delivering against that plan. Our focus category playbook is working. Enthusiast buyers are spending more, and advertising and payments continue to grow. This quarter, we launched several key innovations in line with our long-term objectives. These ongoing efforts have put eBay in a stronger position today than it was when we entered the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that during the second quarter, we delivered better than expected financial results across the board. We delivered over $18.5 billion in GMV and over $2.4 billion in revenue. We continue to invest in marketing and product while achieving close to 29% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.99. Our focus category payments and advertising initiatives helped offset the impact of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a more uncertain macro environment. Looking ahead, we remain on track to deliver on our full year commitments, and we'll continue to invest and manage towards sustainable long-term growth. Later in the call, Steve will go into more detail about our outlook. One of the most important pillars of our long-term plan is our focus category strategy. Investments in trust, product experience and marketing are increasing customer satisfaction, leading to faster volume growth. Last quarter, excluding trading cards, focus category GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. Trading cards are lower than last year's [stimulus fuelled] (ph) results, but volume remains robust at more than double prepandemic levels. We are seeing significant outperformance in focus categories globally. Although the US is higher than international. The primary reasons for the difference are the timing of launches and category mix by market. The markets where it's implemented these changes, customer satisfaction remains at or near best-in-class levels. The vast majority of our enthusiast buyer shop in focus categories and their spending levels remain above $3,000 per year. We continue to see cross-category shopping activity consistent with data we shared during Investor Day in March. One of our largest focus categories is parts and accessories, which is one of the highest buyer NPS scores on the platform. We know from experience how crucial trust is, and fitment is one of the best enablers of trust. To ensure every buyer finds the perfect part to fit their vehicle, we are enhancing all of the AI that powers search, merchandising and advertising. In addition, we have rolled out more ways for P&A enthusiasts to discover the wide range of inventory on eBay. In our international markets, we have added over 100,000 fitment-based browse pages last quarter alone. We also expanded our supply of OEM and certified green parts. To drive demand to our huge supply of P&A inventory, we continue to invest in full-funnel marketing. Initial consideration is showing encouraging early signs, and we see further opportunity to attract more enthusiasts. Across other focus categories, we took several steps over the past quarter to expand coverage. To enhance our leadership position in trading cards, we expanded authentication services to a wider range of graded items. In addition, we rolled out a new feature where enthusiasts can now use the popular My Collections tool to track a broader set of inventory, including sports trading cards. In eBay Refurbished, we added more trusted sellers and expanded categories in the program. These included headphones, audio, gaming consoles and smart home devices. Refurbished products are growing faster than new products in the same category, in part due to increased customer satisfaction. And in sneakers, we added more products to our catalog, which now includes the top 40 brands across our 4 largest markets. This expansion reduces friction in selling and buying experiences. We also started authenticating handbags in Germany and handbag accessories such as wallets in the U.S. The next focus category where we are innovating and changing the customer experience is jewelry. Recently, we announced authentication for eligible new and preowned jewelry items over $500. We are partnering with GIA, the Gemological Institute of America, who bring 90 years of experience to our partnership. Like other focus categories, we will improve the product experience, increase customer satisfaction and change how we market to jewelry enthusiasts over time. I am pleased with the near-term progress in focus categories, and we remain on track to expand coverage and drive growth back towards market rates. Equally important is evolving our capabilities to attract the next generation of enthusiast buyers. In Q2, we took several steps toward that objective. In June, we marked an important milestone with the opening of the eBay Vault. This state-of-the-art facility enables a new format for sellers and buyers to trade and build their collections in real time. The Vault is initially accepting graded authenticated trading cards above $500 and will expand to more products over time. Sellers are taking advantage of an initial year of free storage and no selling fees for Vault sales. This innovation will help us transform many product categories. One reason that we're excited to launch the Vault is because it can enable real-time transactions for physical or digital goods. This intersection is nascent, the one that collectible enthusiasts are increasingly exploring. This is part of the rationale behind our second quarter acquisition of KnownOrigin. KnownOrigin is an NFT platform that enables artists and collectors to create, buy and resell NFTs via blockchain-supported transactions. Their team is highly talented and has extensive technical experience in this rapidly evolving space. They were one of the early pioneers of NFTs and are a perfect fit to make eBay the destination to collect and trade. In the second quarter, we also began to experiment with Live Commerce. Although Western market adoption of live shopping remains low, we are optimizing our user experience ahead of this emerging trend. Early pilots have seen users engage, on average, for 15 minutes at a time with approximately 1/4 of them interacting directly with the event. We will continue to optimize this capability in future quarters. The Vault, NFTs and Live Commerce were all long-term strategic opportunities that we mentioned at Investor Day, and I'm pleased that in a few short months, we are already making progress in these areas. Customers are also seeing rapid improvements in payments capabilities where we continue to build out new services for sellers and buyers. For example, we rolled out additional forms of payment popular with German buyers, especially Gen Z. Through our partnership with Klarna, consumers can now pay upon invoice or in installments. We also expanded our Buyer FX program, which allows eBay buyers to purchase in the currency of their choice. Recently, we expanded this global service from 8 currencies to over 30 currencies. To date, we have seen over 60% adoption on related transactions. These new services are reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers while delivering incremental revenue to eBay. Advertising is also driving growth through innovation. Despite the macro environment, ad rates and adoption continue to grow due to the high return on ad spend that seller's experience on eBay. In Q2, our ads business accelerated faster than volume and delivered revenue that was nearly 1.5% of GMV. Promoted Listings drove first-party ad revenue to $232 million, up 6%. This was 20 points faster than GMV growth. Our largest product, Standard Promoted Listings, grew in the quarter due to conversion optimization and pricing changes. Our 3 newer advertising products that we launched last year grew almost 30% versus Q1. The largest contributor was Promoted Listings Advanced, which saw increased seller adoption and exposure. Our advertising business remains on track with the long-term goals we outlined at Investor Day, and we anticipate that Promoted Listings will return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters. ESG is a major focus for the eBay team. And during the quarter, we made steady progress on our commitments in this space. Recommerce continues to be a huge volume driver on eBay. As we've shared before, non-new and season inventory is driving the vast majority of volume on the platform. In particular, demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories. And we are well positioned to hit our long-term recommerce goals. eBay has a tremendous impact on the economy beyond our own results. As mentioned in our most recent impact report, in the U.S. alone, eBay supports more than 1 million jobs. The vast majority of these jobs come from small and micro business entrepreneurs selling on the platform. Another meaningful economic impact comes from the generosity of our community. eBay for Charity allows sellers and buyers to make a positive difference in the world. During the quarter, eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, up 52% year-over-year. And Q2 marked the Final Power of One Charity Auction with Warren Buffett, raising over $19 million. Over almost two decades, these auctions have raised more than $53 million for GLIDE, a nationally recognized center for equity. I'm truly inspired by the continued generosity powered by our marketplace. Finally, the team and I are honored to have received multiple prestigious awards this quarter. We were recognized as one of LinkedIn's top companies in retail, and we received 3 Women's Choice Awards in the consumer Internet category, Best companies for Diversity, Best Companies for Women and Best Companies for Millennials. I am proud to be in a team that focuses so heavily on the impact we are making in the lives of our employees, our customers and our communities. In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter for eBay. We delivered better-than-expected short-term results while marking several important milestones towards our long-term vision. GMV, revenue and EPS for Q2 all exceeded consensus estimates. Focus categories outperformed the rest of the marketplace by nine points, excluding trading cars. We maintained high NPS scores from enthusiast buyers who spend more per buyer. Coverage extended to more refurbished products and new categories like Joy. The eBay Vault, a game-changing capability that will enable the future of collecting. We acquired KnownOrigin to accelerate our connections between physical and digital. Our payments team scaled our Buyer FX capabilities, further simplifying frost currency transactions and rolled out Klarna to German customers. Our advertising business accelerated faster than volume, putting Promoted Listings on a trajectory to a double-digit growth in the coming quarters. And eBay for Charity raised nearly $56 million, including a record-breaking Power of One Auction with Warren Buffett. Before I hand over to Steve, I want to thank our amazing team who has continued to work hard innovating and exceptional experience for our customers around the world. They are delivering high-quality products and technologies that are translating into higher NPS scores and driving long-term growth for the company. To our sellers, thank you for continuing to partner with us. Your feedback is extremely valuable and helps us create trusted, reliable and frictionless experiences. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. I think it's hard to differentiate discretionary versus nondiscretionary. I think if you go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we had 5 -- we have five big areas over $10 billion. So obviously, when times are tough, people trade down, and that's where kind of our Refurb is helping out, et cetera. So hard to kind of pull that out. But I would say, as Steve said, it's -- we don't have grocery or material FMCG on the site. Yes. Look, we're pleased with the outperformance of focus categories being 9 points above the rest of the business. Importantly, we're continuing to invest. We rolled out jewelry this quarter with a partnership with GIA for jewelry over $500. We expanded what we're doing in handbags, launching that in Germany, bringing accessories, things like wallets in the U.S., expanded Refurb to additional categories, headphones audio, gaming console, smart home devices. So we're continuing to invest in our focus categories. As I've always said, it's not a won and done. I mean if you think about the launch of vault and the incremental authentication that we've launched in collectibles, that was a category we started on as a focus category more than a year ago. So we're going to continue to innovate both on the existing ones that are there and launch new ones like we did with jewelry this quarter. Yes. So it's early days, as you said, but we're excited by the initial feedback from the early customers. So it's having the intended impact, which is giving them a frictionless way to buy and sell on the platform to encourage sellers to use it because, obviously, there's a first-mover advantage. We think once the product is in the vault. It's unlikely to move to a different vault or there can be withdrawal. So we reduced fees through the end of the year on things like storage and selling fees in order to encourage adoption. And we're kind of right on track with where we thought. We're going to continue to innovate, add more categories and add more products over time, but a good early start to the program. Yes. So on the first one on the kind of countercyclical, I'm really happy we refocused the strategy towards non-new and season 2.5 years ago because it is -- we're leaning into opportunities of where the consumer can be and makes the platform more resilient. So we are seeing strength in things like our refurbished category where consumers can trade down. And frankly, just the value of eBay of having non-new and season makes the platform a little bit more resilient. Over time as well selling is important in tough times for consumers because, as I've said all along, they've got $4,000 of stuff in the house that they could sell, and they -- less than 20% of that is online. So we're essentially working to kind of lean into both. On your question on awareness around our spend, we do look at everything, buyers traffic and seller. But 1 thing we measure pretty religiously is kind of initial consideration of what we're doing. So what you see us do is shift from doing a lot of lower funnel to more full-funnel marketing. I think about us being at the New York parts, Joe, what we're doing in collectibles with the MLB All-Star games. Next week, you'll see us launch a program in the U.K. with Pimp My Ride, which is really focused on our parts and accessories and being where enthusiasts are. And what we're really doing there is focusing on eBay and initial consideration set and really talking about the value propositions that we're building through focus categories. And what I'd say is we're excited about the initial results and the early movements in ICS in the campaigns that we're running. Yes. So I'd say a couple of things. First, on the collectibles business, yes, we've leaned in a lot to trading cards because of the opportunity that we see in that market. But if you go back to Investor Day, where we size the collectibles business, it's over a $10 billion category. So there's lots of different elements in there and, frankly, lots of different elements geographically. So there's things stronger in our U.K. and German business where trading cards is more of a U.S. phenomenon from that perspective because collecting is interesting regionally, although there is a good amount of cross-border trade when it comes to collectibles. So we're going to continue to invest in collectibles and broadly as a category. On KnownOrigin, it's really -- a key part of that is the talent that we're bringing in. If you look at the team there, they're really the founding -- some of the founding pioneers and the early work around NFTs and digital. And so bringing that directly into eBay, I think, really helps us as we think about the intersection of physical and digital, some of the pieces that Jordan outlined at Investor Day because eBay has been always the place where people go to collect things. And so being able to figure out how to bring them on to the platform, I think, is a key advantage. I'd say it's really early days, but I think we found a great amazing team that we're integrating into the business. Yes. And I assume when you mean advertising solutions, you mean what we're doing to bring traffic to the site, not the advertising product on the site. So on the marketing side, yes, we've absolutely been doing a shift both kind of moving more towards mid-funnel, going after more paid social younger demographics in terms of what we're doing with TikTok and those types of programs. And we've been enhancing what we're doing from a marketing perspective, rolling out a new marketing technology, we call it user experience platform, to help us be much more efficient with that. As it relates to specifically to sellers, I'd point to 2 things. First is the investments that we're making in external Promoted Listings. So having sellers that are in our Promoted Listings product, be able to generate specific traffic to their business. And then the second thing is all the work that we've done over the last probably 18 months around eBay stores, about letting them build the brand in the marketplace, about letting them incorporate videos into their experience, around letting them spend coupons to interested or repeat buyers in the platform because we see this twofold. One is being able to drive traffic there but also helping them drive their repeat business on eBay, which is why we've been making those investments. Also, we think it's really critical to our second pillar being the seller platform of choice. So we're going to continue to push forward on those types of innovations on behalf of our sellers. Yes. So we're excited by what we're seeing in terms of spend per buyer. So we -- if you look at -- versus 2019, our spend per buyer for enthusiast buyers are actually up double digits. And that ties right into what we're doing from a focus category strategy. The second thing that we're really focused on is that multiplier effect that we talked about at Investor Day, the fact that watches buyer will come in and spend $8,000 in watches, but $9,000 in the rest of the site, a parts buyer will buy $500, but then buy $700 outside of that. And that helps us drive the strategy around what we -- what we're going after with enthusiast buyers and spend per buyer. It's also why we changed our marketing programs to be much more targeted at acquiring enthusiast buyers. Steve, do you want to cover the second one? Yes. I'd just add that when I talk to our eBayers in Germany and U.K., they get their gas bills twice a year, in some cases, once a year. And definitely, there's the impact there of that. And I think that's part of why we see a bigger impact on our European business than we -- our international business than we do in the Americas. Yes. So first, on the Ad Business Act, we tend to provide a really good rollout for our sellers. So there's still a lot of penetration opportunity in our Promoted Listing standard product and driving incremental adoption for more sellers across more listings, et cetera. But we're pleased this quarter to really start seeing some traction in our newest products. As I talked about on the call, our newest products are up 30% quarter-on-quarter, which is great to see. This will lead to Promoted Listings that's double digit in the coming quarters. And I just -- of the 3 new products, I'd highlight Advanced, I think, as a significant opportunity for us because of the monetization that it provides and because we still have a good ways to go in terms of driving adoption on the platform. I'd just say it's a continual dial and frank in terms of optimizing the buyer experience, the tools that we have and the algorithms to make sure that we're not degrading buyer experience. We're enhancing it and continue to provide a return on ad sales. But I'm happy to see the 1.5% penetration we got to this quarter. And like I said, the future quarters should allow us to drive double-digit growth. Steve, do you want to take the second one on... Yes. So on eBay Live, our live shopping pilot, I would say it's early, John. We're kind of in the test phase of that. And it's really about learning about how eBay engages the best way to get customers engaged. I would say from our early test that we're excited by what we saw both in terms of the time people were engaged, to engage 15 minutes in a video, especially with today's attention span of consumers, and the interaction. We had a quarter of people like interacting with the experience. So we feel really good about what it can be. As you've seen from a macro standpoint, it's had a lot more traction in the Asia region than it has here. It's still much more of a nascent technology, but first as well with some of the categories like some of the other pilots that we have. So I'd just say very early testing and learning at this stage. On advertising, what we talked about is getting to a double-digit growth in the coming quarters, and we feel comfortable about our plans to do that really on the strength of our core product and standard and on the growth that we're seeing out of our new products. Yes. We're really pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the rollouts on parts and accessories. I'd say both from a marketing standpoint. So we're getting aggressive in our key markets about driving an initial consideration set. I talked earlier about some of the stuff we're doing with sponsorship of Pimp My Ride. We did the same thing with eBay Auto Parts Show in New York. Those types of things led to 3 billion media impressions for us from that standpoint. And as I talked about, really going after that enthusiasts, leaning into things like I was just out in our European markets. And their certified green parts are incredibly important, and we continue to add more of that supply onto the marketplace. And then secondarily, I'd just say on the product side, improvements in fitment, improvements in the organization of the inventory and the collaboration is important. We enhance some of the AI that powers our search and our merchandising and our advertising really around this idea of fitment and how to make sure that we have 100% trust and the fitment on the product. So we're excited about what we're seeing and the results, the movement that we're seeing in initial consideration set. And we're not going to be done. This is going to be a category that we're going to continue to innovate on quarter after quarter. Yes. So on the first one, part of the reason why we look at '19 is just the massive acceleration that we saw over the COVID time period and kind of comparing the pre and post with the massive restriction and mobility and the stimulus that was there in the market. Obviously, we believe we're definitely coming out of the pandemic much stronger than we came into it. And our strategy is working. To your question on focus categories, our focus category strategy is really focused on non-new and season. So we've kind of really moved away from new and season. You can still obviously buy it on the site, and we have that product. But we're leaning into where eBay is strong. If I go back to the Investor Day, it's a $1.1 trillion TAM growing to $1.4 trillion. And we think given the tougher economic times right now, our strategy of where we're focusing from that category standpoint is exactly where we need to be, and it's frankly a strength for eBay. Do you want to take the third one, Steve?"

With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to acknowledge the terrible human tragedy that continues to unfold in Ukraine. This is a very difficult time for many, and I'm proud of how eBay employees and customers have mobilized to support those affected. At our core, eBay exists to help people and communities around the world. This role is fundamental to our purpose and motivates our workforce. In addition to direct and indirect support for refugees and citizens, we will continue policy actions to help customers in the region.  These events have had a negative impact on consumer health, primarily in European markets. Despite this unexpected headwind, our global results for Q1 were strong.  Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. Focused category innovation expanded, and these categories continue to grow faster than the rest of the marketplace. 18 million enthusiast buyers continue to shop regularly on eBay, purchasing items over 30 times per year. Sellers are seeing a simpler unified listing experience, and we made several improvements to eBay stores in the quarter. We announced a deal with climate to provide more popular payment methods to German buyers, and we started testing the new eBay wallet.  Our advertising business grew faster than GMV due to increased optimization and adoption of new products. And finally, we made significant progress on our e-commerce, DE&I and sustainability goals. Sellers and buyers are turning to eBay, and this led to financial results at the high end of our expectations. We delivered over $19.4 billion in GMV and close to $2.5 billion in revenue. We continue to make the long-term investments laid out at Investor Day while achieving a 32% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1.05, $0.02 ahead of consensus.  Given the challenges our customers are facing around the world, we are pleased with our performance to start the year. Since late February, when the war in Ukraine began, we have seen lower e-commerce traffic, inflation in gas prices and home energy costs and historically low consumer confidence, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. As we look forward to the rest of 2022, we find ourselves in the most dynamic macro environment I have seen since returning to eBay as CEO. We expect more near-term headwinds to e-commerce growth rates this year, and our revised guidance reflects our best year based on recent trends. Steve will go into more detail about our full year expectations later.  During these uncertain times, one thing that remains clear is that the tech-led reimagination is improving the underlying health of our business, and we are on track towards our long-term growth targets. One example is in focus categories. The investments in trust, user experience and marketing are driving higher customer satisfaction, leading to faster GMV growth. In Q1, excluding trading cards, focused category GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. This growth is on top of last year's stimulus-driven surge, which drove exceptional volume in many high ASP products.  Despite challenging year-over-year comps, trading cards remains one of our healthiest growth businesses. In the first half of 2021, we saw an unprecedented surge boosted by mobility restrictions and stimulus. Since that time, volume has remained elevated. And in Q1, GMV was more than double the size of pre-pandemic levels.  As a leading trading cards platform, we continue to innovate our experience to increase trust between buyers and sellers. In Q1, we launched authenticity guarantee for ungraded cards above $750. Just this week, we expanded authentication to cards by signing a strategic partnership with PSA, the global leader in trading card grading and authentication. We expect this partnership will increase customer satisfaction and result in more GMV growth.  We are incredibly excited for the launch of the Vault this quarter, which will transform our Collectibles business. Items in the vault will be able to securely transfer between sellers and buyers in a matter of seconds without the need to ship or the need to reauthenticate. We see an opportunity to hold up to $3 billion of inventory in our vault in the next few years, creating significant GMV and revenue growth potential.  Looking beyond Collectibles, we continue to expand coverage of focused categories to more products and markets. Let me share a few examples. At the end of March, we started authenticating high-value handbags in the U.K. and Australia. We also expanded the number of handbag brands covered by our authenticity guarantee and began to authenticate men's bags in the U.S.  Another area in Q1 was eBay Refurbished. After success with certified products direct from manufacturers, we have significantly expanded the program across smart watches, tablets, laptops and guest steps. Now buyers can shop from sellers across a wide range of refurbished inventory backed by eBay's moneyback guarantee and warranties. These trusted products contribute to e-commerce, which saves consumers money and reduces carbon emissions.  The luxury watch category continues to grow at positive double-digit rates on top of last year's strong growth rate. To date, we have authenticated watches over $2,000 across 3 markets. This quarter, we added the ability for buyers to request expert verification for a fee for watches valued between $1,000 and $2,000. This additional service marks an important milestone in our journey to increase trust through authentication. This feature is portable to other categories and markets across the platform and demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of our playbook.  In our sneakers category, we reintroduced final value fees in the U.S. in January, and growth momentum continued. These fees are lower than most other platforms and customer satisfaction remains near historically high levels. Sneaker GMV is also growing significantly faster than the rest of the business in our international markets. We repeated the successful approach first deployed in the U.S., which includes authentication, influencer partnerships and increased social marketing investments.  In parts and accessories, supply chain constraints and low vehicle inventory are driving up the price of new and used cars. These trends are driving more consumers to extend the life of their current vehicles. With approximately 0.5 billion P&A listings, we are well positioned to supply all the parts they need. We have been investing in full funnel marketing for parts and accessories since December, and we are starting to see modest gains in initial consideration. This includes partnerships with leading influencers and enthusiasts to showcase our vast inventory selection. A recent example is the eBay Auto Parts Show in New York, where several top influencers showcased that restored in custom vehicles. These do-it-yourself enthusiasts crafted reconcept cars using unique and hard-to-find parts on eBay. This event generated 3 billion media impressions in 1 week, supporting the momentum we are seeing in the P&A category.  While sellers and buyers love what we are doing in focused categories, we are also making site-wide enhancements to help all sellers grow their business. In Q1, we made several significant changes to further modernize our store's experience. First, our new storefront page provides sellers the ability to tell their story, showcase their brand and increase trust in their business. Second, we optimized SEO for stores to drive more free traffic. Third, we increased the prominence of store inventory and made it easier for enthusiasts to find stores throughout the buyer journey.  To support sellers and help them grow their buyer base, we also increased the ability for buyers to save sellers for future purchases. Now when buyers purchase items, they are prompted after checkout to save that seller. This has driven a 4x increase in the number of saved sellers to date, which leads to more purchase frequency. New buyers who save a seller in their first 90 days are more than twice as likely to repurchase an item.  More sellers are sending coded coupons to drive repeat purchases. To date, over 7.5 million buyers have purchased an item from a seller funded coupon, equating to approximately $500 million in GMV. To help sellers improve targeting, they can now categorize their buyers in unique groups for customized marketing campaigns.  Our payments platform is enabling new services and reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers. We signed an agreement with Klarna in early March, bringing 2 popular payment methods, pay upon invoice and installments, to our German buyers. Testing is underway, and we are on track to make it available to all German consumers this quarter.  We started testing and scaling other payment studies in Q1, including the new digital wallet we announced at Investor Day. When sellers earn money, that balance is stored on eBay and readily available for them to purchase items or pay for selling expenses like shipping labels. We will continue to optimize this feature and expand to more customers during the year.  Approximately 1 in 5 transactions occurs across borders, and our payments platform is reducing friction on these purchases. In Q1, we started giving buyers the option to pay in their local currency in addition to the currency of the listing. This feature simplifies cross-border trade and also enables incremental payments revenue to fund further innovation.  I'm excited by the pace of innovation in payments. After completing the migration last year, we are moving quickly to reduce friction, launch new services and leverage our scale to benefit sellers and buyers.  Another area where innovation is driving growth is our advertising. In Q1, our ads business once again outpaced volume. Ad revenue growth was driven by Promoted Listings, which generated $222 million in revenue, up 2%. This was 19 points faster than GMV, and it has accelerated due to product innovation. Our standard Promoted Listings product, which still drives most of our first-party ad revenue, continues to drive growth through increased adoption and conversion optimization. And we see further runway in the quarters and years ahead.  The 3 new products launched last year are early in the growth cycle but are up more than 50% versus Q4. The first product, Promoted Listings Express, is increasing conversion and price realization for auction sellers. A typical auction that leverages this feature is attracting several hundred more buyers per listing.  The second product, External Promoted Listings, is now open to our entire global seller base. Similar to standard Promoted Listings, sellers choose the value of their ad spend. We continue to expand the list of affiliate partners in the program to drive more traffic directly to sellers with Promoted Listings.  The third product, Promoted Listings Advance, while still limited data, has been scaled to more professional sellers. In Q1, we expanded the number of ad groups, providing more bidding capacity and flexibility. This product will take time to reach its full potential, and we see opportunities for significant growth. We are continuing to invest in our advertising platform and expect ad revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future.  We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG. Let me share a few highlights. Firstly, on Recommerce. In 2021, our platform generated over $4 billion in positive economic impact from the sale of used and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to taking 300,000 cars off the road for a year. Recommerce on eBay is growing due to our focus on non-new and season categories. Demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories, and we are well positioned to hit the long-term goals I shared with you at Investor Day.  Secondly, I'm proud of our team's efforts around DE&I. We are about to publish our sixth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. This report provides insights into our 4 strategic objectives: increased representation, cultivating a sense of belonging, engaging our communities and building inclusive technology. Aligning and executing on these objectives is how we build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fearlessly inclusive place to sell, buy and work.  The third area of progress I would like to highlight is reducing our impact on the planet. Last year, we set ambitious, long-term, science-based targets. For the full year 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 26% versus 2019. For Scope 3, which includes the impact of shipments on our platform, we reduced emissions by 7% versus 2019 despite volume growth. Lastly, 90% of our energy now comes from renewable sources, and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs and our annual impact report later this month.  I'm always impressed by the generosity of our sellers and buyers. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $36 million, up 2%. We recently announced the grand finale of the Power of One charity auction with Warren Buffett. Since launching on eBay over 20 years ago, over $34 million has been raised to support Glide, a nationally recognized center for equity. The eBay Foundation, whose mission is to remove systemic barriers to entrepreneurship, committed $11 million to nonprofits in Q1. In addition, during March, over $2.4 million was raised from employee contributions and eBay Foundation matching gifts, many of which went to support Ukrainian relief efforts.  Across a number of other employee and customer channels, the company has raised millions of dollars for Ukraine-related causes. In several countries, customers contributed to give at checkout campaigns that supported the Red Cross, Nova Ukraine and Save the Children. We are very fortunate to work for a purpose-driven company with a team relentlessly focused on helping people and the scale to deliver meaningful impact to our communities.  In closing, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We extended focused category coverage in watches, handbags, trading cards and eBay Refurbished. And we laid the groundwork to launch the Vault this quarter, a game-changing experience for collectors. We released several new features for eBay store sellers like new store fronts and enhanced SEO. And we're encouraging more buyers to save their favorite sellers to drive repeat purchases.  In payments, we launched Klarna for German buyers, started testing a new digital wallet and increased currency payment options for cross-border buyers. Our advertising business is meaningfully outpacing volume growth through optimization and new product innovation. And we are achieving all of this while executing on an ambitious ESG agenda to support our communities and the world we live in.  Before I hand it over to Steve, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our seller and buyer community whose energy and unique inventory make our marketplace truly differentiated in e-commerce. I would also like to thank all of our global employees for their tireless efforts to delight customers and support our communities. Their dedication and focus are improving our underlying business health every day.  Lastly, I'm thrilled to welcome Eddie Garcia back to eBay as our new core product leader. His wealth of eBay knowledge and track record of innovation will be great assets to continue to drive the tech-led reimagination.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with financial highlights on Slide 9 of our Q1 earnings presentation. Next, I'll provide a deeper look into key operating and financial metrics, including a discussion of our ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical developments influencing our business. Finally, I'll share our forward outlook and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.  Overall, we delivered strong results in Q1 as GMV, revenue and EPS met or exceeded expectations and performed near the high end of our outlook ranges. Our Q1 results were driven by continued progress against the strategic objectives we outlined at Investor Day, including an expansion in coverage and capabilities of our focused categories and improved technology for our sellers and buyers.  Our first quarter revenue was down 5% to $2.48 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 12 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, up roughly 80 basis points sequentially. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share, down 2% as compared to a record quarterly EPS result last year. We generated $546 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  We achieved these results despite some back-end softness, associated changing macro conditions and the tragic conflict in Ukraine. I'm extremely proud of our team's focus and execution amid these challenging circumstances.  Let's take a closer look at our performance in Q1. Gross merchandise volume declined 17% as we lapped a 7 point sequential acceleration during 2021 and which was driven by global mobility restrictions and U.S. stimulus payments. As compared to our pre-COVID baseline in Q1 of 2019, GMV grew 7%. We were extremely pleased with the pace of growth, innovation and execution with our focused categories during Q1, coming off a record surge in growth in early 2021. Trading card volumes appear to be stabilizing at a quarterly run rate, more than double pre-COVID levels, indicating continued healthy demand in this asset class. Excluding trading cards, year-on-year growth in focused categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 9 points.  We sustained strong positive growth within our luxury categories compared with last year's stimulus-driven results, including sneakers over $100, where we reintroduced monetization in the U.S. in January. Trading 12-month active buyers were 142 million during the quarter, down roughly 5 million sequentially due to the same lapping dynamics. But importantly, this anticipated decline was skewed towards our low-value buyers. Trends within our high-value groups remained healthy as our 18 million buyers spent an average of over $3,000 across 9 categories over the last 12 months. Average spend per enthusiast also rose sequentially and increased low double digits versus 2019.  U.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q1 of 2019, while international GMV was roughly flat. Similar to prior quarters, our U.S. volume benefited from stronger underlying e-commerce growth, beneficial category mix and earlier launches of focused category initiatives. Meanwhile, our international business has experienced softer economic growth and greater exposure to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. When we spoke at our March Investor Day, we were beginning to observe modest softness in our European markets during the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict intensified in the weeks that followed. The headwinds to our business became more pronounced. We estimate the Ukraine will represent a low single-digit negative impact to our global business in Q1. Notably, these macro headwinds have not impacted our product road map or other strategic initiatives.  Net revenue during the quarter was $2.48 billion, down 5% with positive contributions from payments and ads, offset by comparisons with last year's extraordinary volume growth. Our transaction take rate increased by over 30 basis points sequentially to 12.1%. Managed payments contributed over 8 points of revenue growth during the quarter as we fully migrated to our proprietary platform, while new initiatives like buyer and seller FX are scaling in line with expectations.  First-party ads primarily promoted listings grew 2% during Q1 and outpaced volume by approximately 19 points. This marked an acceleration from roughly 15 points in Q4 as we further optimized our standard Promoted Listings product and recent additions to our ad portfolio grew in scale and adoption.  Turning to margins. We delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.4% in Q1, an increase of more than 80 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by lower seasonal spend in sales and marketing, which was offset by volume deleverage as we lapped last year's GMV acceleration.  During the first quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, down 2% from our record quarterly EPS in Q1 of 2021. The impact of share repurchases and contributions from payments and ads were offset by the lapping of mobility tailwinds. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $2.28 with the delta driven by losses on our investment portfolio amid recent market volatility.  We generated $546 million of free cash flow in Q1, down 37% due to lower volume and the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration, partly offset by lower cash taxes. As we discussed at Investor Day, we do expect our cash taxes to rise this year due to the timing of repatriation payments and new federal tax treatment of R&D credits. These dynamics are not muted to eBay, and we expect to revert to a more normalized cash tax rate after 2025.  We ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $8.3 billion as we paid down $750 million of notes during March. We repurchased $1.25 billion of shares during the quarter at an average price of approximately $57. This was in addition to a portion of shares from our Q4 accelerated share repurchase program that settled in early Q1. Additionally, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in March, representing $0.22 per share.  Our investments are detailed on Slide 19. Our remaining portfolio is valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1 after a quarter of significant market volatility. We sold roughly $600 million of Adyen and KakaoBank shares during Q1. We will continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value, which includes maintaining our investments when we believe we can generate incremental value for shareholders or monetizing them when we see an opportunity to do so. To that end, we sold Adyen shares during Q1 at an average price more than 7x the strike price of our first tranche.  Moving to our outlook. Russia and Ukraine have historically made up less than 1% of our global volume, but the war in Ukraine has measurably impacted economic growth and consumer confidence throughout Europe and other parts of the world. This conflict arose as global economies were already contending with inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. On top of that, rising interest rates may further hinder near-term economic growth, while sanctions related to the war could raise already high fuel prices, additional pressure on consumer spending. We're confident our business will remain resilient in the current environment. We are revising our expectations for the remainder of 2022 to reflect the macro conditions we've observed over the last 2 months. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in our focused categories and other strategic initiatives to achieve the long-term growth targets we outlined at Investor Day.  For the full year, we are lowering our FX-neutral growth forecast for GMV by approximately 5%. The strengthening U.S. dollar also reduces our spot GMV outlook by roughly $1.3 billion versus our prior guidance. We now expect GMV of between $73.2 billion and $75.2 billion in 2022, representing a decline between 12% and 10%. We forecast revenue of $9.6 billion to $9.9 billion, representing a decline of between 6% and 3%. Our updated forecast operating margin between 29% and 30% as we expect to mitigate some macro-driven volume pressure through cost efficiencies. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.10, representing negative 3% to positive 2% growth.  Looking to the second quarter, we expect to generate $18.02 billion to $18.42 billion of GMV, representing a decline between 16% and 14% or between 2% and 4% growth versus Q2 of 2019. We forecast revenue between $2.35 billion and $2.40 billion, representing a decline between 9% and 7%. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin between 26.5% and 27.5% as we scale our planned investments in product and marketing initiatives. And we project non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.87 and $0.91, representing a decline of between 12% and 8%.  In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics despite facing a challenging confluence of geopolitical and macroeconomic developments in March. We expanded our coverage and capabilities within focused categories, which are delivering innovative new shopping experiences for our community and fueling positive underlying growth in our business. Advertising and payments initiatives are outpacing volume growth, delivering incremental revenue at healthy margins and helping eBay sellers grow their businesses.  Our balanced approach to capital allocation enabled us to invest in strategic initiatives, maintain our best-in-class margins and return more than double our quarterly free cash flow to shareholders. And our focus on Recommerce and sustainable accretive business process has enabled us to achieve these results while supporting our people, our purpose and our plan.  Finally, I'd like to echo Jamie's thanks to our extraordinary eBay employees. Their focus and execution amid the challenges of the last few months has been truly inspiring. We continue to innovate and remain on track to deliver on the product road map we laid out at Investor Day.  And with that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Two questions for me. I guess the message here is the tech-led reimagination is on track. But you hit these macro headwinds that depressed volumes in the near term. So with that context, Jamie, I was hoping you could drill down a bit more on growth in enthusiast buyers. And in particular, how do you expand the size of this group, drive more engagement? And if this relies on converting less active buyers to enthusiasts, those that are already on the platform. And I have a follow-up.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Thanks for the question, Colin. Absolutely. So when you look at our enthusiast buyers, we have 18 million of them. They drive 70% of our GMV. That group is a very productive group for us. It's -- they shop more than 30 days. They spend over $3,000. And even though some of them are moved in and out of mid-value, when you look at our mid-value buyers that we outlined at Investor Day, they're actually of the cumulative lifetime value of most other platforms. So they're also very valuable customers as well.  So the key things we're doing is, a, driving our focused category strategy. When we look at those enthusiast buyers, 94% of them shop in focus categories. So that's a big opportunity. 25% of them are selling on eBay, and that obviously drives the flywheel of performance. When we look at it versus 2019, it's not just about the numbers, but how do we get that group to buy more. So versus 2019, they're buying double digits more on the platform. And that has to do with getting them to go cross-category, getting them to be more sticky within their focus category or their initial category, and then all of the pieces that we know kind of drive retention.  The last one I'll just pick up on is it's also tied into our seller strategy. So part of the things that we announced this year -- this quarter with sellers, things like new eBay storefronts, enhancements to the eBay coupons, improvements to SEO. It's all about how to -- it's just not eBay and the platform driving retention of those enthusiast buyers, but how do we put more tools in our sellers' hands so that they can drive the retention of the buyers as well. So feel really good that the strategy is working and the plans are intact.\nColin Sebastian: That's helpful. And then secondly, maybe for Steve. It looks like guidance for the back half of the year implies somewhat normal sequential seasonality in volume for Q3 and Q4 off of that lower Q2. So I guess this suggests the outlook assumes no improvement or no worsening in the macro environment, if that's the right way to think about it.\nStephen Priest: Colin, good to speak. As you can imagine, we've been very deliberate in terms of how we've looked at the outlook for the remainder of 2022 based on this base of uncertain and challenged environment. I'd just like to -- you're correct in terms of your assumption as we go forward with regards to seasonality. So just as a reminder, as we talked about at our last earnings call, we do have a half 1 and half 2 underlying story for 2022 as we lap some of the significant tailwinds associated with COVID in 2021 in the first half as we go forward.  But we -- despite the -- I suppose, at a macro level, we do see this overall softness driven by the macroeconomic environment, but we still expect the sort of seasonal shape of the GMV as we go forward.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Two if I can, just following up on Colin and following up on the macro issue. Are you seeing different behaviors in the macro environment between your high-value buyers and low-value buyers? And would that inform any decisions of maybe accelerating some of the investments you want to make in terms of improving the skew of your buyer base as we go through 2022? That would be a sort of question number one. And then secondarily, you pointed out the gap between GMV and ads, which was quite wide. How should we think about that gap between ads outperformance relative to GMV beyond just what you reported in Q1 given against your innovation curve run ads longer term?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Thanks, Eric. So look, when we think about the impact macro, it's really across the board. We can look at, obviously, our own traffic and traffic of our competitors. And specifically in Europe or more so in Europe, really coincidental with the war, we saw the impact overall to the business. So there's various movements. I would say last year with the pandemic, we moved some mid-value up into enthusiast buyers as we looked at the segments. But really, it's kind of across the board, everyone's energy prices are going up, more cost of fuel, inflation, et cetera.  To your second question, we're really happy with the performance of ads being at 19% above GMV this quarter. And we talked about kind of the growth that we're seeing in the new products, although the large part of it is still our core product, which is the Promoted Listing standard. But continue to drive optimization, continue to drive adoption. We're still in kind of the early stages of the new products on advertising.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Tom Champion from Piper Sandler.\nThomas Champion: Jamie, maybe you could talk about the focused category growth of 9%. I think it was 15% previously. Can you help us interpret that in terms of ongoing sustainability?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So a couple of things. One is really pleased to see that 9 points faster growth in terms of the focus categories. We are lapping some stimulus from last year in our numbers. So that's certainly a factor. And then over time, Tom, the math would say as we increase our coverage of focus categories, obviously, the delta will decrease just because of the math of more of the numerator being, the denominator as well. But as we look at this as a multiyear, the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day is right -- is consistent, getting them to grow at or above market growth rates. What I'd say I'm really happy about this quarter is that we're seeing the same type of deviation between focused categories in international that we saw in the U.S. in terms of their outperformance of the rest of the site. So we've been talking for a couple of quarters now about how international was more nascent, and we're starting to see that traction in the focus categories. And we talked about some of the new launches that we're seeing internationally.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Just sticking with the macro discussion. The 5 points lower revision on full year GMV guide, maybe can you elaborate a little bit on what signals you're seeing now to arrive at the 500 basis point reduction? I mean a lot of uncertainty is still kind of ahead of us. So does this revised guide reflect what you're seeing now? Or does this also factor in potential unfavorable trends in the second half? And then how should we think about your expectations for 2023 and 2024 based on the revised 2022 targets?\nStephen Priest: Deepak, I'll pick those up. As I mentioned on the previous question, we've been very thoughtful and deliberate about the '22 guide as we look out for the remainder of the year and really reflecting what we see as ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the overall environment. I think I would pull it down to sort of 3 specific areas as you think and contemplate the guide that we put out.  First, the continued negative economic impact of the terrible atrocities associated with the war in Ukraine, and our expectation that those negative impacts will continue through 2022. The other is, overall, the continued headwinds from the broader macro environment. You think about things like interest rates, fuel prices, energy costs that's putting an additional pressure on the consumer and their discretionary spend. And we're particularly seeing this in Europe, in a couple of our key markets in the U.K. and Germany, where we're seeing consumer confidence at historic lows.  And then we are also assuming as a third item, the expected continuation of the supply chain disruptions that we've seen for a number of quarters here that continues to put a drag on our international business. So when I think about those 3 areas, that's what we've contemplated when we look in the macro environment, and we went forward to that 2022 guide.  Beyond 2022, as you recall, we talked to the investor community back in March at our investor event, and we remain confident in our long-term guide. We see these issues as transitory. Our long-term guide contemplated mid-single-digit GMV growth. We remain confident in that. We continue to make the investments for the long-term future. You heard Jamie talk about the momentum that we're seeing in our prepared comments. And so we certainly see that as a longer-term perspective as we now get these choppy waters in the near term.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So Jamie, your commentary about expanding the authenticated brands and bags is interesting. Sounds like you're not quite done going deeper into the category. And also kind of along with that, can you talk about how parts and accessories rollout proceed? I mean is it going to be a gradual rollout of a category-by-category, a model-by-model basis? And is there a similar opportunity to go deeper into watches as well? And I think also to follow up on Eric's question earlier, I think throughout 2021, you've more than doubled the number of Promoted Listing sellers, but that's still a minority percentage of the total sellers. I get that this is probably not appropriate for everybody, but what can you do to drive greater seller adoption? Is it just a matter of awareness? Or is there -- does the product set needs to be expanded?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Great question. So first, the way I think about the focused category is it's not like we invest in the category and that we're done. If you look at it, we're still investing in sneakers, which we launched quite some time ago. So we continue to make innovations even in categories that we've launched. The category that you first brought up handbags, we expanded what we're doing in authentication to the U.K. in a beta this quarter. We also expanded in the U.S. to men's bags this quarter. So now currently authenticating in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. So that will be a continued playbook.  I would say the same thing about parts and accessories is in addition to all the things we're doing around consideration, we're continuing to drive quarter-after-quarter new features, new capabilities for those categories.  You mentioned watches at the end. That's another category. Even though we launched authentication a couple of quarters back for watches, this quarter, we built a new capability, which is actually allowing buyers to pay for authentication if they want it for watches between $1,000 and $2,000. So it will be a continued evolution of focused categories as we launch new ones and continue to enhance them.  I'd say a couple of things about the collectibles category. I'm really excited by this quarter. A, our Vault is on track that we talked about at Investor Day and a lot of potential there to save, reauthenticating, shipping the products. On Monday, we announced a partnership with PSA. PSA is the most popular grader for trading cards, and now you can have your cards authenticated by PSA, over $2,000. And so like I said before, everything is kind of a continued evolution of enhancements to drive customer satisfaction.  On your question on advertising, yes, we feel great. The thing that makes us feel great about the opportunity for more penetration is the ROAs that we continue to see. We have strong ROAS for our sellers. And so it's obviously easiest to get the largest sellers to start using the product and drive that penetration first. But we're, for example, launching a new unified listing experience, which has a great advertising inclusion. This quarter, we announced some optimization tools for our product listing advanced. And look, it took us 5 years to get the -- to get the standard product to where it is today. So these things do take time to drive adoption, to drive optimization, but we feel like the suite of products that we launched is the right one.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Ross Sandler from Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: I just had two questions. First, can you remind us what cross-border GMV peaked at prepandemic compared to the 20% today? And you mentioned the new payment partnerships and this new wallet potentially getting that going in the future. So how material could that be? And I guess other than like some of the log jam clearing up in China outbound, what else can you do to crank up cross-border? And the second question is you normally have a downtick in 2Q operating margin seasonally. This one is a little bit more pronounced than normal. So just any color on those investment levels? Or is that just from some of the GMV weakness you were talking about previously?\nStephen Priest: Ross, I'll pick up the first item on cross-border. We've pretty steadily been -- about 20% of our business has been from a cross-border standpoint as we've gone forward. We haven't sort of seen any major change in that. Obviously, as we've gone through the supply chain challenges that we've been seeing over numerous quarters that we've talked about extensively, that has continued to put some additional pressure on that.  Maybe I can just kick off on a few items on payments and then allow Jamie to sort of continue to address other items associated with that. I have to say I've been really taken by the exceptional execution the team has gone through over the last 18 to 24 months with the integration of the whole payments platform, and it gives us a great opportunity to continue to drive value for our shareholders as we go through that, whether that's through faster payouts, buyer/seller FX, higher ASP items that we talked a lot about on our investor event that generates the $300 million as we go forward. The wallet, we're really excited about, and that's something we also talked about at the Investor Day.  Jamie, do you want to just elaborate a little bit more from your perspective?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Ross, I'm happy with our pace of innovation. So the Klarna deal that we announced, which we'll be launching this quarter, actually allows us to accept forms of payments, which are very popular in Germany, which we've not been able to accept, primarily pay upon invoice and financing. And so that's one component. Steve talked about the digital wallet, which is in beta now, which obviously helps us with the flywheel, also helps sellers because they can store a balance for their selling costs like shipping, et cetera. And then to your question on cross-border trade, we are doing things to help. They're having somewhat of an impact, being able to forward deploy inventory through a partnership that we've done. But our cross-border trade elements, as Steve said, have been roughly steady.\nStephen Priest: And then just to pick up with your question around sort of Q2 margins, there's naturally an underlying seasonal impact that we sort of go through. But as we talked about on our last earnings call, we did expect Q2 would be our lowest margin for the year based on the phasing of our investments. As you can imagine, we are leaning in based on the macro environment to sort of shorter-term costs, but we are continuing to invest in product, full funnel marketing and making sure that the longer-term strategy stays on track. And so these are some of the dynamics at play with regard to our second quarter margin profile that you've heard about today.\nOperator: Our next question, we have Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.\nDaniel Salmon: Jamie, you welcomed back Eddie Garcia in your prepared remarks, and that's a change that's happened since we last saw you all at the Investor Day. Could you elaborate maybe a little on the transition from Peter Thomson to him? And is there any new particular direction or the initiatives that you expect Eddie to lead as he takes over responsibility for your product, put a stamp on so to speak?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. With the departure of Pete in that transition, I went out and tried to find the absolute best product person in the world that I can find. Eddie has a really unique ability. He combines product UX and technology like no other executive that I've met. And importantly, too, he has a decade of background with eBay, which is extremely valuable to come in and really hit the ground running. And he's already started. I think he's on day 8 today, and is doing a great job. So really excited to have him here.  I would say no, nothing changes in terms of the product road map. He's got a great team of leaders underneath him. We have a strong organization, and the road map is very solid for the year. I mean if I just look at payments as an example, this quarter, they announced a deal with Klarna at Investor Day. They're about to launch it. They launched a new capability to do buyer FX, so the buyers could pay in their local currency. They've made enhancements and ramped up stored value, all of that within a single quarter.  So I'm happy with our pace of innovation across the board. I'm just thrilled that Eddie could be part of the leadership team and help us push forward on the tech-led reimagination.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Kramer from Arete Research.\nRichard Kramer: Jamie, you've -- sorry, there's a big echo here. Jamie, you mentioned quite a bit about the focused strategy and laying that out, but still seems to leave eBay vulnerable to vertical sites in specific categories, which have some social or community hosting to engage users. How far might you see stores evolving to allow them to have their own maybe brands or IDs and try to engage users in more ways than simply buying? And Steve, I guess, the other question, if you look at the guidance for 6 to 7 points of upside from payments and ads, is that simply lapping the payment saturation or completions? Or do you imply some sort of slowing of ads growth over the course of the year despite all these new formats you mentioned?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Richard, great question. I'll take the first one, and Steve should take the second. So absolutely, one of the benefits that eBay has versus any vertical-specific marketplace is our scale, the fact that we can get buyers to buy cross-category, that we can acquire them at a lower cost. And if you look at, let's say, a parts and accessories buyer, they're going to come in and buy $1,200 in parts and accessories but then $1,500 elsewhere on the site. But we are leaning into the areas that you're talking about. How do we make it easier for buyers and sellers to transact on the marketplace? How do we build retention between them? So I'd point to a couple of things that we've launched in the last few quarters. The first is our new member-to-member messaging system. It's very simple and easy to use. It's chat-like interface, very familiar for a Gen Z customer to interact between a buyer and seller. And that's a huge improvement over the legacy products that we've had out there for a long time.  We've been opening up the ability for couponing and reaching back out to interested buyers on the platform that have transacted with you. And really, the -- as you talk about, stores is really the opportunity to let sellers build a brand and communicate with buyers. So this quarter, we launched the new storefront on -- for our eBay store sellers. We actually improved the ability for them to drive more SEO via their stores in the platform. We've added video into the stores platform. So now you can tell your story about an eBay seller, and that's very appealing.  And we'll continue to build more of those features to improve the interactions between buyers and sellers because it's one of the very unique capabilities of eBay, is that vast army of sellers that we have, helping drive retention in buyers and helping drive engagement there. So great question.  Steve, do you want to take the second part?\nStephen Priest: Yes. Richard, I think you're talking about the 6 point delta between the FX-neutral GMV and FX-neutral revenue. I'd say there's 3 dynamics at play. Number one, you're right, we're sort of lapping through the completion of managed payments as we've transitioned from '21 to '22. So we see less of a tailwind associated with that. But on the flip side, the other 2 items is the continued momentum with regards to the investments we were making in both payments with some of the items that Jamie talked about earlier in terms of the execution from the team and what's being driven associated with that, and then the continued success in the ads platform. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ads was growing at 19 points faster than GMV. So it's really the combination of those 3 factors that I've talked about that gets the implied guide going forward.\nOperator: For our next question, we have John Blackledge from Cowen.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Two questions. First, could you expand a bit on how the trading card segment performed in the first quarter? And how does the launch of the Vault trading card and overall collection business? And then second, which e-commerce verticals were the biggest headwinds in GMV, perhaps the toughest comps in 1Q and 2Q?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So I'd say on trading cards, what we said in there is that we're obviously lapping kind of the massive stimulus that we saw last year. We're settling out at twice the level of GMV that we were beforehand. And we're really kind of leaning in to fuel the growth in trading cards. So to your question on Vault, the beauty of the Vault is a lot of -- for a lot of collectors, it's not something that they need to have around their house. They want to be able to trade. And you could see trades happening in the middle of the game where the rookie all of a sudden is on fire, and people want to start trading that. That trade becomes really seamless when it sits inside the Vault. It's authenticated on the way in. It doesn't have to be shipped anywhere, validated, et cetera.  And so you could see these billions of dollars of inventory, we could start to drive turns on that on a much more rapid basis. So we're excited by that. We're also excited by the grading partnership that we announced on Monday, which complements what we've been doing for ungraded cards over $750 because it builds more authenticity and trust into what we're doing from a trading cards perspective. So that builds on top of last year's launches that we had like the improved shipping labels, the computer vision that we're working on in that category, et cetera.  So really excited by that. When I look at the rest of the categories, watches continues to be strong. We sustained double-digit growth on top of last year's strong growth rate. We've been able to remonetize sneakers and keep the momentum in that category. Strong growth in handbags as well. And we talked about some of those announcements in the business. So across the board, I think we are -- the strategy that we have is working. We're seeing the change in customer satisfaction and the change of the business and the deviation that these categories are able to create. And then we're starting to see that expand internationally.\nJoe Billante: Operator, we've got time for one more.\nOperator: And for our last question, we will have Justin Post from Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Just a couple of questions. There's been a lot of write-downs in the group. And obviously, the e-commerce group is under pressure. You have the advantage of really strong cash flow. How are you thinking about the asset opportunities, bringing things into eBay? And then second, just on the U.S. GMV. It was down quarter-over-quarter, which has happened in the past. Did you see a slowdown there related to Ukraine as well and -- or gas price is a factor?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So on the first one, we continue to look at build, buy and partner in those opportunities. We talked about Sneaker Con at the Investor Day and why we did that and how it made sense to accelerate our focus and what we were doing in that category. And we continue to look at opportunities that we think will help push that further in terms of new features, new functionality or new audience. But we do look at it as a build, buy and partner. So a great example is what we announced on Monday, which is a partnership with the most popular grading to really build an opportunity to tie that closely into the best marketplace that exists for trading cards on eBay. So we'll continue to be opportunistic across all of those different elements as we go forward as long as they align with the strategy and we think create value for shareholders.  On the international versus GMV, I'll start off. And then, Steve, you can jump in. Clearly, a more profound effect in our international business. When I talk to our eBayers in the U.K., they're getting their April energy bills and they are multiple of what they were before. So definitely more of an impact, but definitely an impact across the whole world, including our U.S. business.  Do you want to expand?\nStephen Priest: Yes, I'll just give a little bit of extra color. I think when we bifurcate what we've seen between international and the U.S. in terms of consumer sentiment, U.S. and U.K. consumer sentiment is at pretty much historic based on what we've seen. But as you can imagine, some of this is percolated over to the U.S. in terms of inflation going up, higher prices and also the inflation that's going forward.  So the U.S. is not immune to this. It's more -- we saw in the first quarter some deeper penetration challenges in the European business. But I think it's a fair comment just in that there has been some slowdown. And as we go further forward during 2022, at a macro level, you can sort of see that implied in our guidance and go forward.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion with financial highlights on Slide 9 of our Q1 earnings presentation. Next, I'll provide a deeper look into key operating and financial metrics, including a discussion of our ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical developments influencing our business. Finally, I'll share our forward outlook and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. Please note, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons at constant currency, unless I note otherwise.  Overall, we delivered strong results in Q1 as GMV, revenue and EPS met or exceeded expectations and performed near the high end of our outlook ranges. Our Q1 results were driven by continued progress against the strategic objectives we outlined at Investor Day, including an expansion in coverage and capabilities of our focused categories and improved technology for our sellers and buyers.  Our first quarter revenue was down 5% to $2.48 billion, outpacing volume growth by approximately 12 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, up roughly 80 basis points sequentially. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share, down 2% as compared to a record quarterly EPS result last year. We generated $546 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  We achieved these results despite some back-end softness, associated changing macro conditions and the tragic conflict in Ukraine. I'm extremely proud of our team's focus and execution amid these challenging circumstances.  Let's take a closer look at our performance in Q1. Gross merchandise volume declined 17% as we lapped a 7 point sequential acceleration during 2021 and which was driven by global mobility restrictions and U.S. stimulus payments. As compared to our pre-COVID baseline in Q1 of 2019, GMV grew 7%. We were extremely pleased with the pace of growth, innovation and execution with our focused categories during Q1, coming off a record surge in growth in early 2021. Trading card volumes appear to be stabilizing at a quarterly run rate, more than double pre-COVID levels, indicating continued healthy demand in this asset class. Excluding trading cards, year-on-year growth in focused categories outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 9 points.  We sustained strong positive growth within our luxury categories compared with last year's stimulus-driven results, including sneakers over $100, where we reintroduced monetization in the U.S. in January. Trading 12-month active buyers were 142 million during the quarter, down roughly 5 million sequentially due to the same lapping dynamics. But importantly, this anticipated decline was skewed towards our low-value buyers. Trends within our high-value groups remained healthy as our 18 million buyers spent an average of over $3,000 across 9 categories over the last 12 months. Average spend per enthusiast also rose sequentially and increased low double digits versus 2019.  U.S. GMV grew 17% compared to Q1 of 2019, while international GMV was roughly flat. Similar to prior quarters, our U.S. volume benefited from stronger underlying e-commerce growth, beneficial category mix and earlier launches of focused category initiatives. Meanwhile, our international business has experienced softer economic growth and greater exposure to the supply chain challenges impacting cross-border trade. When we spoke at our March Investor Day, we were beginning to observe modest softness in our European markets during the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict intensified in the weeks that followed. The headwinds to our business became more pronounced. We estimate the Ukraine will represent a low single-digit negative impact to our global business in Q1. Notably, these macro headwinds have not impacted our product road map or other strategic initiatives.  Net revenue during the quarter was $2.48 billion, down 5% with positive contributions from payments and ads, offset by comparisons with last year's extraordinary volume growth. Our transaction take rate increased by over 30 basis points sequentially to 12.1%. Managed payments contributed over 8 points of revenue growth during the quarter as we fully migrated to our proprietary platform, while new initiatives like buyer and seller FX are scaling in line with expectations.  First-party ads primarily promoted listings grew 2% during Q1 and outpaced volume by approximately 19 points. This marked an acceleration from roughly 15 points in Q4 as we further optimized our standard Promoted Listings product and recent additions to our ad portfolio grew in scale and adoption.  Turning to margins. We delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.4% in Q1, an increase of more than 80 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by lower seasonal spend in sales and marketing, which was offset by volume deleverage as we lapped last year's GMV acceleration.  During the first quarter, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP EPS, down 2% from our record quarterly EPS in Q1 of 2021. The impact of share repurchases and contributions from payments and ads were offset by the lapping of mobility tailwinds. We generated a GAAP loss per share of $2.28 with the delta driven by losses on our investment portfolio amid recent market volatility.  We generated $546 million of free cash flow in Q1, down 37% due to lower volume and the lapping of onetime working capital benefits associated with the managed payments migration, partly offset by lower cash taxes. As we discussed at Investor Day, we do expect our cash taxes to rise this year due to the timing of repatriation payments and new federal tax treatment of R&D credits. These dynamics are not muted to eBay, and we expect to revert to a more normalized cash tax rate after 2025.  We ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $8.3 billion as we paid down $750 million of notes during March. We repurchased $1.25 billion of shares during the quarter at an average price of approximately $57. This was in addition to a portion of shares from our Q4 accelerated share repurchase program that settled in early Q1. Additionally, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in March, representing $0.22 per share.  Our investments are detailed on Slide 19. Our remaining portfolio is valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1 after a quarter of significant market volatility. We sold roughly $600 million of Adyen and KakaoBank shares during Q1. We will continue to manage our investment portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value, which includes maintaining our investments when we believe we can generate incremental value for shareholders or monetizing them when we see an opportunity to do so. To that end, we sold Adyen shares during Q1 at an average price more than 7x the strike price of our first tranche.  Moving to our outlook. Russia and Ukraine have historically made up less than 1% of our global volume, but the war in Ukraine has measurably impacted economic growth and consumer confidence throughout Europe and other parts of the world. This conflict arose as global economies were already contending with inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. On top of that, rising interest rates may further hinder near-term economic growth, while sanctions related to the war could raise already high fuel prices, additional pressure on consumer spending. We're confident our business will remain resilient in the current environment. We are revising our expectations for the remainder of 2022 to reflect the macro conditions we've observed over the last 2 months. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in our focused categories and other strategic initiatives to achieve the long-term growth targets we outlined at Investor Day.  For the full year, we are lowering our FX-neutral growth forecast for GMV by approximately 5%. The strengthening U.S. dollar also reduces our spot GMV outlook by roughly $1.3 billion versus our prior guidance. We now expect GMV of between $73.2 billion and $75.2 billion in 2022, representing a decline between 12% and 10%. We forecast revenue of $9.6 billion to $9.9 billion, representing a decline of between 6% and 3%. Our updated forecast operating margin between 29% and 30% as we expect to mitigate some macro-driven volume pressure through cost efficiencies. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.10, representing negative 3% to positive 2% growth.  Looking to the second quarter, we expect to generate $18.02 billion to $18.42 billion of GMV, representing a decline between 16% and 14% or between 2% and 4% growth versus Q2 of 2019. We forecast revenue between $2.35 billion and $2.40 billion, representing a decline between 9% and 7%. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin between 26.5% and 27.5% as we scale our planned investments in product and marketing initiatives. And we project non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.87 and $0.91, representing a decline of between 12% and 8%.  In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics despite facing a challenging confluence of geopolitical and macroeconomic developments in March. We expanded our coverage and capabilities within focused categories, which are delivering innovative new shopping experiences for our community and fueling positive underlying growth in our business. Advertising and payments initiatives are outpacing volume growth, delivering incremental revenue at healthy margins and helping eBay sellers grow their businesses.  Our balanced approach to capital allocation enabled us to invest in strategic initiatives, maintain our best-in-class margins and return more than double our quarterly free cash flow to shareholders. And our focus on Recommerce and sustainable accretive business process has enabled us to achieve these results while supporting our people, our purpose and our plan.  Finally, I'd like to echo Jamie's thanks to our extraordinary eBay employees. Their focus and execution amid the challenges of the last few months has been truly inspiring. We continue to innovate and remain on track to deliver on the product road map we laid out at Investor Day.  And with that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Colin, good to speak. As you can imagine, we've been very deliberate in terms of how we've looked at the outlook for the remainder of 2022 based on this base of uncertain and challenged environment. I'd just like to -- you're correct in terms of your assumption as we go forward with regards to seasonality. So just as a reminder, as we talked about at our last earnings call, we do have a half 1 and half 2 underlying story for 2022 as we lap some of the significant tailwinds associated with COVID in 2021 in the first half as we go forward.  But we -- despite the -- I suppose, at a macro level, we do see this overall softness driven by the macroeconomic environment, but we still expect the sort of seasonal shape of the GMV as we go forward. Deepak, I'll pick those up. As I mentioned on the previous question, we've been very thoughtful and deliberate about the '22 guide as we look out for the remainder of the year and really reflecting what we see as ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the overall environment. I think I would pull it down to sort of 3 specific areas as you think and contemplate the guide that we put out.  First, the continued negative economic impact of the terrible atrocities associated with the war in Ukraine, and our expectation that those negative impacts will continue through 2022. The other is, overall, the continued headwinds from the broader macro environment. You think about things like interest rates, fuel prices, energy costs that's putting an additional pressure on the consumer and their discretionary spend. And we're particularly seeing this in Europe, in a couple of our key markets in the U.K. and Germany, where we're seeing consumer confidence at historic lows.  And then we are also assuming as a third item, the expected continuation of the supply chain disruptions that we've seen for a number of quarters here that continues to put a drag on our international business. So when I think about those 3 areas, that's what we've contemplated when we look in the macro environment, and we went forward to that 2022 guide.  Beyond 2022, as you recall, we talked to the investor community back in March at our investor event, and we remain confident in our long-term guide. We see these issues as transitory. Our long-term guide contemplated mid-single-digit GMV growth. We remain confident in that. We continue to make the investments for the long-term future. You heard Jamie talk about the momentum that we're seeing in our prepared comments. And so we certainly see that as a longer-term perspective as we now get these choppy waters in the near term. Ross, I'll pick up the first item on cross-border. We've pretty steadily been -- about 20% of our business has been from a cross-border standpoint as we've gone forward. We haven't sort of seen any major change in that. Obviously, as we've gone through the supply chain challenges that we've been seeing over numerous quarters that we've talked about extensively, that has continued to put some additional pressure on that.  Maybe I can just kick off on a few items on payments and then allow Jamie to sort of continue to address other items associated with that. I have to say I've been really taken by the exceptional execution the team has gone through over the last 18 to 24 months with the integration of the whole payments platform, and it gives us a great opportunity to continue to drive value for our shareholders as we go through that, whether that's through faster payouts, buyer/seller FX, higher ASP items that we talked a lot about on our investor event that generates the $300 million as we go forward. The wallet, we're really excited about, and that's something we also talked about at the Investor Day.  Jamie, do you want to just elaborate a little bit more from your perspective? And then just to pick up with your question around sort of Q2 margins, there's naturally an underlying seasonal impact that we sort of go through. But as we talked about on our last earnings call, we did expect Q2 would be our lowest margin for the year based on the phasing of our investments. As you can imagine, we are leaning in based on the macro environment to sort of shorter-term costs, but we are continuing to invest in product, full funnel marketing and making sure that the longer-term strategy stays on track. And so these are some of the dynamics at play with regard to our second quarter margin profile that you've heard about today. Yes. Richard, I think you're talking about the 6 point delta between the FX-neutral GMV and FX-neutral revenue. I'd say there's 3 dynamics at play. Number one, you're right, we're sort of lapping through the completion of managed payments as we've transitioned from '21 to '22. So we see less of a tailwind associated with that. But on the flip side, the other 2 items is the continued momentum with regards to the investments we were making in both payments with some of the items that Jamie talked about earlier in terms of the execution from the team and what's being driven associated with that, and then the continued success in the ads platform. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ads was growing at 19 points faster than GMV. So it's really the combination of those 3 factors that I've talked about that gets the implied guide going forward. Yes, I'll just give a little bit of extra color. I think when we bifurcate what we've seen between international and the U.S. in terms of consumer sentiment, U.S. and U.K. consumer sentiment is at pretty much historic based on what we've seen. But as you can imagine, some of this is percolated over to the U.S. in terms of inflation going up, higher prices and also the inflation that's going forward.  So the U.S. is not immune to this. It's more -- we saw in the first quarter some deeper penetration challenges in the European business. But I think it's a fair comment just in that there has been some slowdown. And as we go further forward during 2022, at a macro level, you can sort of see that implied in our guidance and go forward."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to acknowledge the terrible human tragedy that continues to unfold in Ukraine. This is a very difficult time for many, and I'm proud of how eBay employees and customers have mobilized to support those affected. At our core, eBay exists to help people and communities around the world. This role is fundamental to our purpose and motivates our workforce. In addition to direct and indirect support for refugees and citizens, we will continue policy actions to help customers in the region.  These events have had a negative impact on consumer health, primarily in European markets. Despite this unexpected headwind, our global results for Q1 were strong.  Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter. Focused category innovation expanded, and these categories continue to grow faster than the rest of the marketplace. 18 million enthusiast buyers continue to shop regularly on eBay, purchasing items over 30 times per year. Sellers are seeing a simpler unified listing experience, and we made several improvements to eBay stores in the quarter. We announced a deal with climate to provide more popular payment methods to German buyers, and we started testing the new eBay wallet.  Our advertising business grew faster than GMV due to increased optimization and adoption of new products. And finally, we made significant progress on our e-commerce, DE&I and sustainability goals. Sellers and buyers are turning to eBay, and this led to financial results at the high end of our expectations. We delivered over $19.4 billion in GMV and close to $2.5 billion in revenue. We continue to make the long-term investments laid out at Investor Day while achieving a 32% operating margin. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1.05, $0.02 ahead of consensus.  Given the challenges our customers are facing around the world, we are pleased with our performance to start the year. Since late February, when the war in Ukraine began, we have seen lower e-commerce traffic, inflation in gas prices and home energy costs and historically low consumer confidence, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. As we look forward to the rest of 2022, we find ourselves in the most dynamic macro environment I have seen since returning to eBay as CEO. We expect more near-term headwinds to e-commerce growth rates this year, and our revised guidance reflects our best year based on recent trends. Steve will go into more detail about our full year expectations later.  During these uncertain times, one thing that remains clear is that the tech-led reimagination is improving the underlying health of our business, and we are on track towards our long-term growth targets. One example is in focus categories. The investments in trust, user experience and marketing are driving higher customer satisfaction, leading to faster GMV growth. In Q1, excluding trading cards, focused category GMV grew 9 points faster than the rest of the platform. This growth is on top of last year's stimulus-driven surge, which drove exceptional volume in many high ASP products.  Despite challenging year-over-year comps, trading cards remains one of our healthiest growth businesses. In the first half of 2021, we saw an unprecedented surge boosted by mobility restrictions and stimulus. Since that time, volume has remained elevated. And in Q1, GMV was more than double the size of pre-pandemic levels.  As a leading trading cards platform, we continue to innovate our experience to increase trust between buyers and sellers. In Q1, we launched authenticity guarantee for ungraded cards above $750. Just this week, we expanded authentication to cards by signing a strategic partnership with PSA, the global leader in trading card grading and authentication. We expect this partnership will increase customer satisfaction and result in more GMV growth.  We are incredibly excited for the launch of the Vault this quarter, which will transform our Collectibles business. Items in the vault will be able to securely transfer between sellers and buyers in a matter of seconds without the need to ship or the need to reauthenticate. We see an opportunity to hold up to $3 billion of inventory in our vault in the next few years, creating significant GMV and revenue growth potential.  Looking beyond Collectibles, we continue to expand coverage of focused categories to more products and markets. Let me share a few examples. At the end of March, we started authenticating high-value handbags in the U.K. and Australia. We also expanded the number of handbag brands covered by our authenticity guarantee and began to authenticate men's bags in the U.S.  Another area in Q1 was eBay Refurbished. After success with certified products direct from manufacturers, we have significantly expanded the program across smart watches, tablets, laptops and guest steps. Now buyers can shop from sellers across a wide range of refurbished inventory backed by eBay's moneyback guarantee and warranties. These trusted products contribute to e-commerce, which saves consumers money and reduces carbon emissions.  The luxury watch category continues to grow at positive double-digit rates on top of last year's strong growth rate. To date, we have authenticated watches over $2,000 across 3 markets. This quarter, we added the ability for buyers to request expert verification for a fee for watches valued between $1,000 and $2,000. This additional service marks an important milestone in our journey to increase trust through authentication. This feature is portable to other categories and markets across the platform and demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of our playbook.  In our sneakers category, we reintroduced final value fees in the U.S. in January, and growth momentum continued. These fees are lower than most other platforms and customer satisfaction remains near historically high levels. Sneaker GMV is also growing significantly faster than the rest of the business in our international markets. We repeated the successful approach first deployed in the U.S., which includes authentication, influencer partnerships and increased social marketing investments.  In parts and accessories, supply chain constraints and low vehicle inventory are driving up the price of new and used cars. These trends are driving more consumers to extend the life of their current vehicles. With approximately 0.5 billion P&A listings, we are well positioned to supply all the parts they need. We have been investing in full funnel marketing for parts and accessories since December, and we are starting to see modest gains in initial consideration. This includes partnerships with leading influencers and enthusiasts to showcase our vast inventory selection. A recent example is the eBay Auto Parts Show in New York, where several top influencers showcased that restored in custom vehicles. These do-it-yourself enthusiasts crafted reconcept cars using unique and hard-to-find parts on eBay. This event generated 3 billion media impressions in 1 week, supporting the momentum we are seeing in the P&A category.  While sellers and buyers love what we are doing in focused categories, we are also making site-wide enhancements to help all sellers grow their business. In Q1, we made several significant changes to further modernize our store's experience. First, our new storefront page provides sellers the ability to tell their story, showcase their brand and increase trust in their business. Second, we optimized SEO for stores to drive more free traffic. Third, we increased the prominence of store inventory and made it easier for enthusiasts to find stores throughout the buyer journey.  To support sellers and help them grow their buyer base, we also increased the ability for buyers to save sellers for future purchases. Now when buyers purchase items, they are prompted after checkout to save that seller. This has driven a 4x increase in the number of saved sellers to date, which leads to more purchase frequency. New buyers who save a seller in their first 90 days are more than twice as likely to repurchase an item.  More sellers are sending coded coupons to drive repeat purchases. To date, over 7.5 million buyers have purchased an item from a seller funded coupon, equating to approximately $500 million in GMV. To help sellers improve targeting, they can now categorize their buyers in unique groups for customized marketing campaigns.  Our payments platform is enabling new services and reducing transactional friction for sellers and buyers. We signed an agreement with Klarna in early March, bringing 2 popular payment methods, pay upon invoice and installments, to our German buyers. Testing is underway, and we are on track to make it available to all German consumers this quarter.  We started testing and scaling other payment studies in Q1, including the new digital wallet we announced at Investor Day. When sellers earn money, that balance is stored on eBay and readily available for them to purchase items or pay for selling expenses like shipping labels. We will continue to optimize this feature and expand to more customers during the year.  Approximately 1 in 5 transactions occurs across borders, and our payments platform is reducing friction on these purchases. In Q1, we started giving buyers the option to pay in their local currency in addition to the currency of the listing. This feature simplifies cross-border trade and also enables incremental payments revenue to fund further innovation.  I'm excited by the pace of innovation in payments. After completing the migration last year, we are moving quickly to reduce friction, launch new services and leverage our scale to benefit sellers and buyers.  Another area where innovation is driving growth is our advertising. In Q1, our ads business once again outpaced volume. Ad revenue growth was driven by Promoted Listings, which generated $222 million in revenue, up 2%. This was 19 points faster than GMV, and it has accelerated due to product innovation. Our standard Promoted Listings product, which still drives most of our first-party ad revenue, continues to drive growth through increased adoption and conversion optimization. And we see further runway in the quarters and years ahead.  The 3 new products launched last year are early in the growth cycle but are up more than 50% versus Q4. The first product, Promoted Listings Express, is increasing conversion and price realization for auction sellers. A typical auction that leverages this feature is attracting several hundred more buyers per listing.  The second product, External Promoted Listings, is now open to our entire global seller base. Similar to standard Promoted Listings, sellers choose the value of their ad spend. We continue to expand the list of affiliate partners in the program to drive more traffic directly to sellers with Promoted Listings.  The third product, Promoted Listings Advance, while still limited data, has been scaled to more professional sellers. In Q1, we expanded the number of ad groups, providing more bidding capacity and flexibility. This product will take time to reach its full potential, and we see opportunities for significant growth. We are continuing to invest in our advertising platform and expect ad revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future.  We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG. Let me share a few highlights. Firstly, on Recommerce. In 2021, our platform generated over $4 billion in positive economic impact from the sale of used and refurbished goods. This activity avoided 1.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to taking 300,000 cars off the road for a year. Recommerce on eBay is growing due to our focus on non-new and season categories. Demand for refurbished and used goods is growing in many categories, and we are well positioned to hit the long-term goals I shared with you at Investor Day.  Secondly, I'm proud of our team's efforts around DE&I. We are about to publish our sixth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. This report provides insights into our 4 strategic objectives: increased representation, cultivating a sense of belonging, engaging our communities and building inclusive technology. Aligning and executing on these objectives is how we build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fearlessly inclusive place to sell, buy and work.  The third area of progress I would like to highlight is reducing our impact on the planet. Last year, we set ambitious, long-term, science-based targets. For the full year 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 26% versus 2019. For Scope 3, which includes the impact of shipments on our platform, we reduced emissions by 7% versus 2019 despite volume growth. Lastly, 90% of our energy now comes from renewable sources, and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs and our annual impact report later this month.  I'm always impressed by the generosity of our sellers and buyers. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $36 million, up 2%. We recently announced the grand finale of the Power of One charity auction with Warren Buffett. Since launching on eBay over 20 years ago, over $34 million has been raised to support Glide, a nationally recognized center for equity. The eBay Foundation, whose mission is to remove systemic barriers to entrepreneurship, committed $11 million to nonprofits in Q1. In addition, during March, over $2.4 million was raised from employee contributions and eBay Foundation matching gifts, many of which went to support Ukrainian relief efforts.  Across a number of other employee and customer channels, the company has raised millions of dollars for Ukraine-related causes. In several countries, customers contributed to give at checkout campaigns that supported the Red Cross, Nova Ukraine and Save the Children. We are very fortunate to work for a purpose-driven company with a team relentlessly focused on helping people and the scale to deliver meaningful impact to our communities.  In closing, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We extended focused category coverage in watches, handbags, trading cards and eBay Refurbished. And we laid the groundwork to launch the Vault this quarter, a game-changing experience for collectors. We released several new features for eBay store sellers like new store fronts and enhanced SEO. And we're encouraging more buyers to save their favorite sellers to drive repeat purchases.  In payments, we launched Klarna for German buyers, started testing a new digital wallet and increased currency payment options for cross-border buyers. Our advertising business is meaningfully outpacing volume growth through optimization and new product innovation. And we are achieving all of this while executing on an ambitious ESG agenda to support our communities and the world we live in.  Before I hand it over to Steve, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our seller and buyer community whose energy and unique inventory make our marketplace truly differentiated in e-commerce. I would also like to thank all of our global employees for their tireless efforts to delight customers and support our communities. Their dedication and focus are improving our underlying business health every day.  Lastly, I'm thrilled to welcome Eddie Garcia back to eBay as our new core product leader. His wealth of eBay knowledge and track record of innovation will be great assets to continue to drive the tech-led reimagination.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Colin. Absolutely. So when you look at our enthusiast buyers, we have 18 million of them. They drive 70% of our GMV. That group is a very productive group for us. It's -- they shop more than 30 days. They spend over $3,000. And even though some of them are moved in and out of mid-value, when you look at our mid-value buyers that we outlined at Investor Day, they're actually of the cumulative lifetime value of most other platforms. So they're also very valuable customers as well.  So the key things we're doing is, a, driving our focused category strategy. When we look at those enthusiast buyers, 94% of them shop in focus categories. So that's a big opportunity. 25% of them are selling on eBay, and that obviously drives the flywheel of performance. When we look at it versus 2019, it's not just about the numbers, but how do we get that group to buy more. So versus 2019, they're buying double digits more on the platform. And that has to do with getting them to go cross-category, getting them to be more sticky within their focus category or their initial category, and then all of the pieces that we know kind of drive retention.  The last one I'll just pick up on is it's also tied into our seller strategy. So part of the things that we announced this year -- this quarter with sellers, things like new eBay storefronts, enhancements to the eBay coupons, improvements to SEO. It's all about how to -- it's just not eBay and the platform driving retention of those enthusiast buyers, but how do we put more tools in our sellers' hands so that they can drive the retention of the buyers as well. So feel really good that the strategy is working and the plans are intact. Yes. Thanks, Eric. So look, when we think about the impact macro, it's really across the board. We can look at, obviously, our own traffic and traffic of our competitors. And specifically in Europe or more so in Europe, really coincidental with the war, we saw the impact overall to the business. So there's various movements. I would say last year with the pandemic, we moved some mid-value up into enthusiast buyers as we looked at the segments. But really, it's kind of across the board, everyone's energy prices are going up, more cost of fuel, inflation, et cetera.  To your second question, we're really happy with the performance of ads being at 19% above GMV this quarter. And we talked about kind of the growth that we're seeing in the new products, although the large part of it is still our core product, which is the Promoted Listing standard. But continue to drive optimization, continue to drive adoption. We're still in kind of the early stages of the new products on advertising. Yes. So a couple of things. One is really pleased to see that 9 points faster growth in terms of the focus categories. We are lapping some stimulus from last year in our numbers. So that's certainly a factor. And then over time, Tom, the math would say as we increase our coverage of focus categories, obviously, the delta will decrease just because of the math of more of the numerator being, the denominator as well. But as we look at this as a multiyear, the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day is right -- is consistent, getting them to grow at or above market growth rates. What I'd say I'm really happy about this quarter is that we're seeing the same type of deviation between focused categories in international that we saw in the U.S. in terms of their outperformance of the rest of the site. So we've been talking for a couple of quarters now about how international was more nascent, and we're starting to see that traction in the focus categories. And we talked about some of the new launches that we're seeing internationally. Yes. Great question. So first, the way I think about the focused category is it's not like we invest in the category and that we're done. If you look at it, we're still investing in sneakers, which we launched quite some time ago. So we continue to make innovations even in categories that we've launched. The category that you first brought up handbags, we expanded what we're doing in authentication to the U.K. in a beta this quarter. We also expanded in the U.S. to men's bags this quarter. So now currently authenticating in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. So that will be a continued playbook.  I would say the same thing about parts and accessories is in addition to all the things we're doing around consideration, we're continuing to drive quarter-after-quarter new features, new capabilities for those categories.  You mentioned watches at the end. That's another category. Even though we launched authentication a couple of quarters back for watches, this quarter, we built a new capability, which is actually allowing buyers to pay for authentication if they want it for watches between $1,000 and $2,000. So it will be a continued evolution of focused categories as we launch new ones and continue to enhance them.  I'd say a couple of things about the collectibles category. I'm really excited by this quarter. A, our Vault is on track that we talked about at Investor Day and a lot of potential there to save, reauthenticating, shipping the products. On Monday, we announced a partnership with PSA. PSA is the most popular grader for trading cards, and now you can have your cards authenticated by PSA, over $2,000. And so like I said before, everything is kind of a continued evolution of enhancements to drive customer satisfaction.  On your question on advertising, yes, we feel great. The thing that makes us feel great about the opportunity for more penetration is the ROAs that we continue to see. We have strong ROAS for our sellers. And so it's obviously easiest to get the largest sellers to start using the product and drive that penetration first. But we're, for example, launching a new unified listing experience, which has a great advertising inclusion. This quarter, we announced some optimization tools for our product listing advanced. And look, it took us 5 years to get the -- to get the standard product to where it is today. So these things do take time to drive adoption, to drive optimization, but we feel like the suite of products that we launched is the right one. Yes, Ross, I'm happy with our pace of innovation. So the Klarna deal that we announced, which we'll be launching this quarter, actually allows us to accept forms of payments, which are very popular in Germany, which we've not been able to accept, primarily pay upon invoice and financing. And so that's one component. Steve talked about the digital wallet, which is in beta now, which obviously helps us with the flywheel, also helps sellers because they can store a balance for their selling costs like shipping, et cetera. And then to your question on cross-border trade, we are doing things to help. They're having somewhat of an impact, being able to forward deploy inventory through a partnership that we've done. But our cross-border trade elements, as Steve said, have been roughly steady. Yes. With the departure of Pete in that transition, I went out and tried to find the absolute best product person in the world that I can find. Eddie has a really unique ability. He combines product UX and technology like no other executive that I've met. And importantly, too, he has a decade of background with eBay, which is extremely valuable to come in and really hit the ground running. And he's already started. I think he's on day 8 today, and is doing a great job. So really excited to have him here.  I would say no, nothing changes in terms of the product road map. He's got a great team of leaders underneath him. We have a strong organization, and the road map is very solid for the year. I mean if I just look at payments as an example, this quarter, they announced a deal with Klarna at Investor Day. They're about to launch it. They launched a new capability to do buyer FX, so the buyers could pay in their local currency. They've made enhancements and ramped up stored value, all of that within a single quarter.  So I'm happy with our pace of innovation across the board. I'm just thrilled that Eddie could be part of the leadership team and help us push forward on the tech-led reimagination. Yes, Richard, great question. I'll take the first one, and Steve should take the second. So absolutely, one of the benefits that eBay has versus any vertical-specific marketplace is our scale, the fact that we can get buyers to buy cross-category, that we can acquire them at a lower cost. And if you look at, let's say, a parts and accessories buyer, they're going to come in and buy $1,200 in parts and accessories but then $1,500 elsewhere on the site. But we are leaning into the areas that you're talking about. How do we make it easier for buyers and sellers to transact on the marketplace? How do we build retention between them? So I'd point to a couple of things that we've launched in the last few quarters. The first is our new member-to-member messaging system. It's very simple and easy to use. It's chat-like interface, very familiar for a Gen Z customer to interact between a buyer and seller. And that's a huge improvement over the legacy products that we've had out there for a long time.  We've been opening up the ability for couponing and reaching back out to interested buyers on the platform that have transacted with you. And really, the -- as you talk about, stores is really the opportunity to let sellers build a brand and communicate with buyers. So this quarter, we launched the new storefront on -- for our eBay store sellers. We actually improved the ability for them to drive more SEO via their stores in the platform. We've added video into the stores platform. So now you can tell your story about an eBay seller, and that's very appealing.  And we'll continue to build more of those features to improve the interactions between buyers and sellers because it's one of the very unique capabilities of eBay, is that vast army of sellers that we have, helping drive retention in buyers and helping drive engagement there. So great question.  Steve, do you want to take the second part? Yes. So I'd say on trading cards, what we said in there is that we're obviously lapping kind of the massive stimulus that we saw last year. We're settling out at twice the level of GMV that we were beforehand. And we're really kind of leaning in to fuel the growth in trading cards. So to your question on Vault, the beauty of the Vault is a lot of -- for a lot of collectors, it's not something that they need to have around their house. They want to be able to trade. And you could see trades happening in the middle of the game where the rookie all of a sudden is on fire, and people want to start trading that. That trade becomes really seamless when it sits inside the Vault. It's authenticated on the way in. It doesn't have to be shipped anywhere, validated, et cetera.  And so you could see these billions of dollars of inventory, we could start to drive turns on that on a much more rapid basis. So we're excited by that. We're also excited by the grading partnership that we announced on Monday, which complements what we've been doing for ungraded cards over $750 because it builds more authenticity and trust into what we're doing from a trading cards perspective. So that builds on top of last year's launches that we had like the improved shipping labels, the computer vision that we're working on in that category, et cetera.  So really excited by that. When I look at the rest of the categories, watches continues to be strong. We sustained double-digit growth on top of last year's strong growth rate. We've been able to remonetize sneakers and keep the momentum in that category. Strong growth in handbags as well. And we talked about some of those announcements in the business. So across the board, I think we are -- the strategy that we have is working. We're seeing the change in customer satisfaction and the change of the business and the deviation that these categories are able to create. And then we're starting to see that expand internationally. Yes. So on the first one, we continue to look at build, buy and partner in those opportunities. We talked about Sneaker Con at the Investor Day and why we did that and how it made sense to accelerate our focus and what we were doing in that category. And we continue to look at opportunities that we think will help push that further in terms of new features, new functionality or new audience. But we do look at it as a build, buy and partner. So a great example is what we announced on Monday, which is a partnership with the most popular grading to really build an opportunity to tie that closely into the best marketplace that exists for trading cards on eBay. So we'll continue to be opportunistic across all of those different elements as we go forward as long as they align with the strategy and we think create value for shareholders.  On the international versus GMV, I'll start off. And then, Steve, you can jump in. Clearly, a more profound effect in our international business. When I talk to our eBayers in the U.K., they're getting their April energy bills and they are multiple of what they were before. So definitely more of an impact, but definitely an impact across the whole world, including our U.S. business.  Do you want to expand?"

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we made in 2023 against our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts and our goal of returning eBay to long-term sustainable growth. Let's go over a few highlights from the full year. First, despite significant macro pressure on discretionary spending across our major markets, we saw organic year-over-year GMV growth improved during each quarter of 2023, resulting in GMV growth down roughly 1% for the full year. Focus category GMV grew by nearly 4%, outpacing the remainder of our business by roughly 7 points, and we exited 2023 at approaching 30% penetration. We stabilized our active and enthusiast buyer count as acquisition, reactivation and retention improved year-over-year. Our revenue grew 3% organically to over $10 billion. driven by continued momentum in first-party advertising, expansion of our financial services offerings and the launch of eBay International Shipping. And we made significant investments in tech talent and marketing to support our strategic pillars, including making meaningful strides towards establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. These results have demonstrated that we have the right strategy which has put us on a path to building a stronger, more resilient company. In service of that goal, last month, we announced significant organizational changes focused on removing layers and simplifying execution in order to better meet the needs of our customers. This involved the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 1,000 roles and begin to scale back our alternative workforce contracts. This restructuring better aligns our expenses with the growth of our business and I'm confident it will enable us to accelerate innovation while delivering long-term value for shareholders. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We generated $18.6 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q4, nearly flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 3% to $2.6 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, and we delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share resulting in $4.24 of EPS for the full year. Our focus category strategy remained a significant driver of underlying growth during Q4. We focused category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 6 points, growing roughly 4% for the third straight quarter. Our momentum in Motors Parts & Accessories, or P&A, continued in the quarter, as volume growth held steady in the mid-single digits. Our eBay Guaranteed Fit programs have benefited buyer trust and retention across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, driving incremental GMV within P&A last year. During Q4, we began rolling out multi-warehouse shipping optimization to some of our largest U.S. P&A sellers that collectively manage millions of listings. B2C sellers can activate these tools via eBay APIs, and this enables buyers to see more accurate estimated delivery dates when purchasing from sellers with multiple warehouses, which has driven a measurable uplift in conversion for early adopters. In 2024, we plan to onboard sellers in other categories to utilize this technology and tighten delivery estimates across eBay more broadly. Our established position in P&A has led to more than 100 million vehicles being saved in the My Garage section of eBay by active customers. In addition to providing better fitment experiences, we are finding more ways to leverage this valuable data to drive utility for our customers. For example, last quarter, we introduced predictive maintenance that offers AI-driven auto part recommendations based on a vehicle's mileage. Features like this help eBay stay top of mind for customers looking for auto parts at a great value. The work we've done in the eBay Authenticity Guarantee program has also been a key driver of our focused category momentum and raising the level of trust on the marketplace. In Q4, we launched our eighth authentication center in Tokyo, Japan, our first center focused primarily on cross-border trade. Our Tokyo center is currently authenticating luxury handbags and will expand to other highest categories over time. Japan is one of the largest and fastest-growing market for personal luxury goods in the world, enabling our global buyers to tap into a wealth of inventory from the world's most exclusive brands with complete confidence. Earlier this month, we also expanded the Authenticity Guarantee Program to cover loose gemstones. This further extends our product coverage within fine jewelry with authentication from our existing partner, the Gemological Institute of America, a trusted authority for over nine decades. In addition to expanding focus categories, last year, we made a significant investment in Germany, our third largest country as measured by demand. We adopted a similar approach to our vertical playbook to address the unique needs of German consumers. These changes included language enhancements and improvements to search, SEO and recommendations, shipping and return label improvements and a complete overhaul of the local pickup experience. In January, we further improved local discovery in Germany by introducing a new MAP-based browsing experience, which services trending and recently listed items through an intuitive interface based on what's nearby and easy to pick up. Overall, our initiative in Germany has outperformed our initial expectations. We've observed C2C seller NPS and customer satisfaction both up 20 points or more versus our previous baselines. Our buyer NPS also increased by double digits as buyers who sell returned to positive growth following the initiative launch. In addition, enhancements made to our QR code technology has helped reduce unpaid items by more than 50% for local pickups. And importantly, C2C volume in Germany returned to positive growth resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV relative to our prior trajectory. These investments have made our business significantly more resilient to the challenging macro environment in Germany where overall e-commerce growth has been negative in recent quarters. During 2023, we also laid the groundwork to accelerate our capabilities in artificial intelligence and further embed AI throughout the customer experience and our organization. After the first commercial large language models became available from companies like OpenAI and others last year, we immediately found ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve the eBay experience across selling, buying, advertising and marketing. Within a few months, we began fine-tuning open-source LLMs using eBay's proprietary commerce data on our own infrastructure. These models include a smaller number of parameters and thus operated faster and more cost efficiently than commercial LLM when operating at scale. But we also found these fine-tuned LLM could perform as well or in some cases, better than commercial LLM across certain dimensions and use cases, such as generating listing descriptions. To support an even more ambitious AI roadmap for 2024, by the end of Q1, we expect to have doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of last year. Importantly, this investment falls within our historical CapEx budget range of 4% to 5% of revenue. This added GPU capacity, combined with our existing infrastructure, allows us to develop LLMs from scratch pre-trained using eBay's nearly three decades worth of e-commerce data. While we'll continue to take a hybrid approach, leveraging both commercial and open-source LMs, we expect more generative AI services to be powered by internal LLM in 2024, helping make buying and selling on eBay simpler, faster and more magical. In terms of customer-facing features, we continue to iterate on our magical listing experience that has already been used by millions of sellers, which we believe makes it one of the most widely used Gen AI features in e-commerce to date. Generative AI descriptions have rolled out to 100% of users in our top 5 markets. Adoption trends remain healthy. Customer satisfaction continues to be at high levels as we've expanded outside of English-speaking countries and content acceptance rates remain above 90% through the full rollout. The next phase of our magical listing experience is currently being tested by up to 5% of C2C sellers on an opt-in basis. This experience is even more seamless as it leverages our image recognition technology and generative AI to prefill or suggest product titles, categories and other item aspects using photos alone. We are excited to make this experience available to more sellers in Q1 as early feedback from beta users has been incredibly encouraging. I'm also pleased to see the potential benefits our AI tools can have on the billions of listing images across our marketplace as high-quality products photos can have a significant impact on conversion on eBay. Last quarter, we completed the global rollout of our revamped background removal tool in our listing flows, which leverages AI to effortlessly remove background noise from their product images. This tool has enabled sellers to create cleaner, more professional product images and it has received rave reviews from our customers. Building on top of this, we're now leveraging generative AI to make sellers product images even more compelling using our new background swap tool. This feature allows sellers to show their products alongside a wide variety of AI-generated backgrounds. For example, you can display a pair of Air Jordan sneakers on a hardwood basketball court or showcase your preowned hiking boots a top of Pictures Mountain Summit. We are currently testing this feature in beta with 1% of sellers on iOS devices, and I'm excited to see more sellers leveraging these tools to enhance their product images and drive conversion. Now turning to our advertising business, which delivered another strong quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million, while first-party ads outpaced volume by 30 points. For the full year, we generated over $1.4 billion of total advertising revenue, up roughly 25% for the year and more than double our ad revenue in 2019. The over 2.9 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q4, and we currently have over 900 million live promoted listings. Our standard cost per acquisition product remained the largest contributor to year-over-year ads growth in Q4. But notably, Promoted Listings advanced, our cost per click unit was the largest contributor to sequential advertising growth. Our CPC revenue and overall advertiser count benefited from the launch of rule-based campaigns in Q4, which allows sellers to automatically promote new listings based on rules that set for inclusion, such as price range, category, brand or condition. Additionally, during Q4, we launched a top-picks carousel for search. which provides a curated set of promoted listings ads comprised of hyper-relevant top-selling items from our highest ranked sellers. Thus far, buyers have been highly engaged with these ads providing added velocity for our sellers. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones around our sustainability efforts last year, starting with eCommerce. eCommerce continues to provide significant value for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. In 2023, our marketplace generated nearly $4.9 billion in positive economic impact due to sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity helped avoid approximately 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would typically be used in producing new goods and kept nearly 70,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. Additionally, eBay remains committed to enabling more green energy on the U.S. electricity grid. As part of these ambitions, we have entered into agreements for three offsite renewable energy projects over the past four years. Our portion of the latest project is now fully operational, and the green energy produced will be roughly equivalent to the annual energy usage at our data center in Salt Lake City. Combined with our other two projects, this green energy covers over 40% of our global electricity consumption. And I'm incredibly proud that we source over 90% of our energy consumption for eBay controlled offices and data centers from renewable sources overall, and we remain on track to reaching our 100% renewable target by 2025. Now let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $43 million in Q4 and nearly $162 million for the full year. The eBay Foundation granted more than $19 million in 2023 to support historically excluded entrepreneurs and through our employee gift-matching program. I'm honored to be a purpose-driven company that supports communities around the world. For the fifth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. eBay was also included once again in Just Capital and CNBC's list of America's most just companies which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their incredible work and bringing our strategy to life and their tireless support in our community worldwide amid ongoing challenges in the global economy. In closing, while we continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment, I'm incredibly optimistic about our roadmap for 2024. Our teams are better organized for speed, allowing us to be nimble and make critical decisions more quickly. The foundational AI capabilities we developed last year make us well positioned to unlock the power of our data assets, fundamentally change the customer experience on eBay, and drive efficiency across the company in 2024. We will continue to invest in new and existing focus categories while also improving country-specific experiences like we did in Germany last year. We expect continued momentum in first-party advertising, despite lapping outstanding growth in the prior year, while we grow our financial service offerings for customers. And from a financial standpoint, we are in a strong position to expand margins, drive robust earnings growth and deliver healthy capital returns to shareholders in 2024, while still investing in high ROI initiatives to keep us on the path towards sustainable GMV growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and the full year and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. I'm pleased that we met or exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q4 despite observing a softer demand environment during the early part of the quarter. Gross merchandise volume was nearly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew 3% to nearly $2.6 billion, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we returned $379 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was nearly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of up 2 points to reported GMV growth. As we discussed last quarter, we observed softer demand for discretionary goods during the beginning of Q4 as consumers dealt with elevated inflation from higher interest rates in our key markets. Shoppers were more discerning in their purchase behavior as we approach the holidays and the promotional environment adapted to meet their expectations. However, we started to see our business improve towards the end of November, particularly in the U.S., driven by consumers looking for value to stretch their limited holiday budgets. Additionally, we believe recent product improvements modestly benefited our participation in last minute holiday shopping. These included improved accuracy of our estimated delivery dates and product changes we made in Q4 to better highlight listings with faster shipping times. Focused categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. P&A Refurbished and Luxury with the top three contributors to GMV growth in focused categories. P&A delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit GMV growth as improved trust from programs like Guaranteed Fit and growing shipment coverage continue to benefit the overall customer experience. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q4, an improvement of 1 point sequentially. The U.S. consumer demand was notably more resilient relative to our largest international markets, consistent with market benchmarks. The underlying growth was even stronger when we include U.S. buyer spending on cross-border goods. International GMV was down nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis and up 4% as reported due to FX tailwinds. While we saw resilient demand in the U.K. and Germany over the holidays e-commerce market growth in these countries remain challenged. The progress we made in Germany to improve the seller and buyer experiences, particularly within C2C, help mitigate a tough environment where e-commerce growth has been persistently negative. In the U.K., our GMV growth narrowed the gap to market as consumers continue to look for value during the holidays. We also benefited from the lapping of the Royal Mail strikes that impacted results in Q4 of 2022. Moving to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were $132 million at the end of last year. Continuing the trend of stabilization in 2023 after a period of post-COVID rationalization in recent years. Enthusiast buyers remained approximately 16 million. Spend currency enthusiast was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually despite continued pressure on discretionary spending across our major geographies. Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.6 billion during the fourth quarter, up 3%, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of over 1 point to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in Q4 was approximately 13.8%, down roughly 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal category and product mix partly offset by continued momentum in our advertising business and a modest tailwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate was roughly flat despite nearly 0.5 point of FX headwind. Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million and reached 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 30% and to $368 million or 30 points faster than volume. As Jamie discussed earlier, we saw a robust seller adoption of Promoted Listings advanced in Q4, driven by recent innovations like smart targeting on role-based campaigns. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7% during the quarter, improving 30 basis points sequentially and down roughly 3 points year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a headwind to margins of approximately 150 basis points in Q4 compared to a year ago. The remainder is largely attributable to continued investment in product development and the margin impact of recent M&A. As expected, eBay international shipping was no longer a drag on our operating margins in Q4. But this program weighed modestly on gross margins year-over-year. as its cost primarily fall within cost of revenue. Overall gross margin was down about 60 basis points year-over-year as modest headwinds from EIS were partly offset by efficiencies in cost of payments. Within G&A expense, we recognized a GAAP restructuring charge of $99 million in Q4 relating to our recent organizational changes as well as the GAAP accrual of $15 million related to pending legal matters. You will find more information on adjustments in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. While additional details on the legal matters, will be provided in our upcoming 10-K. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07 in Q4, roughly flat year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $1.40 for the quarter, driven by unrealized gains in our equity investment portfolio. These gains were partly offset by stock-based compensation on the aforementioned GAAP restructuring charge. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was negative $3 million in Q4, consistent with our guidance for de minimis free cash flow is California's disaster tax relief program for 2023, delayed the majority of our annual cash tax payments until October. We ended the year with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $250 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $41 during Q4, and had $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in December or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% and cumulative free cash flow over that period. Turning to our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q4. Our Adevinta stake was valued at nearly $4.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion versus Q3. On November 21, a consortium led by Permira and Blackstone announced an offer to acquire Adevinta. This offer is proceeding as expected, and we continue to expect it to close in Q2. The public offer period expired on February 9 with 95% of shareholders accepting the offer which satisfies the requirement of at least 90% acceptance rate. We understand that the consortium is working expeditiously to achieve the remaining regulatory approvals and closes. Our add-in warrants were valued at over $360 million at the end of Q4. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including add-in share price and the probability of vesting. Moving to our outlook. We have started the year with relatively uneven demand across our major markets, with the U.K. and U.K. markets experiencing negative GDP growth and U.S. retail sales weaker than expected in January. The dynamic nature of the operating environment has been incorporated into our GMV outlook as well as a 1 point boost to GMV growth from the extra leap year day. For the first quarter, we expect between $18.2 and $18.5 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of 2% to flat year-over-year or spot GMV decline of 1% or flat. We expect to generate revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.54 billion in Q1, representing FX-neutral growth between flat and 2% and year-over-year. Our forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by over 2 points on an FX-neutral basis, while FX represents close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We forecast Q1 non-GAAP operating margin between 29.6% and 30%, marking both a sequential and year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.19 and $1.23 in the first quarter, representing EPS growth between 7% and 11% year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent a 2-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q1. Now let me share some thoughts on the full year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macroeconomic environment this year, we expect our FX neutral GMV growth rate to turn positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by about 2 points on an FX-neutral basis. We expect FX to represent close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We anticipate our take rate expansion to be primarily driven by continued healthy growth in advertising revenue throughout 2024, although we do face elevated year-over-year comps starting in the second quarter, due to our acceleration in 2023, along with continued secular headwinds within our third-party ads. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year. as we balance continued investments in tech, talent and marketing with organizational efficiencies, productivity gains and savings from our ongoing structural cost program. Our non-GAAP operating margin outlook includes a net benefit of approximately 40 basis points year-over-year, which is primarily driven by a change in accounting estimate associated to the extension of the useful life of data center equipment. Following an assessment of our servers and networking equipment in December, we determined it was appropriate to extend the accounting use for life from three years to four years. You can find more information on this policy change in our 10-K filing. Offsetting this benefit is an operating margin headwind of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year due to foreign exchange as we lapped sizable FX hedging gains in 2023. This is on top of the approximately 30 basis point year-over-year operating margin headwind we experienced in 2023 as we lap the more meaningful hedging gains in 2022. Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be stable between 4% and 5% of revenue, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which contemplates headwinds of $99 million in restructuring charges and $234 million from repatriation tax payments. As a reminder, these repatriation tax payments will remain a temporary headwind to free cash flow through 2025, which is the final year of an 8-year repayment schedule. Details on these tax payments are in the appendix section of our earnings presentation. For Q1, we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.27 per share to be paid out in March. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board recently increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing our total remaining authorization to approximately $3.4 billion. We are targeting at least $2 billion of share repurchases for the year, though the pacing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect to end 2024 with cumulative repurchases and dividends representing approximately 130% of free cash flow since the beginning of 2022, above our original target of 125% for the period. Given our top line assumptions, margin outlook, and healthy capital return expectations, we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year in 2024. In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution during 2023. Despite a very challenging macro environment, we saw underlying momentum in our business as GMV trends improved gradually through the year, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.24, of 3% for the full year. While we are planning our business around the assumption that the macro environment, will continue to be challenging, we remain incredibly confident in our strategy and our plan for 2024. Assuming no further degradation in the environment, we expect our investments in focus categories, local market and C2C initiatives, generative AI and other site-wide improvements to turn GMV growth positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. Although we will continue to invest in our strategic pillars, we are committed to striking the right balance between expenses and revenue growth, and continuing to lead into cost efficiencies to drive 60 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2024. Our fortress balance sheet, enables us to increase our buybacks and dividends this year, leading to total capital return, to shareholders of approximately 130% of cumulative free cash flow, from 2022 to 2024. And I'm extremely pleased this financial plan allows us to target non-GAAP EPS growth, of between 8% to 10% year-over-year, demonstrating the earnings power of our business. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Devnani: Hi, thank you both for taking the question. I wanted to ask about GMV growth. Could you provide a bit more context on the potential for positive GMV growth in Q3 or Q4? Is that anchored on the timing of certain product initiatives that, should accelerate your growth? Anything on your visibility into the back half would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up on margins as well. Your Q1 outlook is quite strong, close to 30%, but it looks like for the full year you're anticipating 28 to 28.5. So just wondering if that delta is due to seasonality, or some discretionary investments that, you see coming down the line, anything there would be helpful? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, thanks, Nikhil. I'll cover the GMV one and then I'll ask Steve to talk about margin. So, when we looked at the start of the year here, we talked about, January having some weather impact. You heard that from other folks as well and improvements kind of since then. You saw, January retail sales show the consumer is a bit stretched. But when we look at the overall plan that we have for the year, we feel really good about the strategy that we're executing on. When you look at focus categories, they continue to outperform the rest of the business. For FY '23, it was a 4% year-over-year growth, about seven points ahead of the business. We like what we saw in terms of the investments that we made in Germany and feel really good about the roadmap that we have in front of us, to drive growth in the business in Q3 or Q4, as Steve outlined. You know, I think importantly, when we look at the kind of underlying health of the business, right now we still have U.K. just in our technical recession, Germany commerce growth is still in negative territory. And so, we have those impacts from the market, but the underlying business and what's happening in the core, we feel really good about. And that's what makes us confident in being able to drive GMV growth as we outline there. Steve, do you want to talk about margin?\nSteve Priest: Yes, indeed. Good afternoon, Nikhil. You're correct. Seasonally, Q1 has been our strongest quarter for operating margin for a while, because of the dynamics of that seasonality. A reminder, we have been driving that through a number of cost savings that we've been driving based on recent actions. And also the accounting policy change that we saw that we discussed in the prepared remarks. I am really pleased with the amount of diligence that we've gone through. The teams are leaning into cost efficiencies in the short-term while we continue to invest for the long-term sustainable growth of eBay. And we're pleased to be in a position to, based on no change in the overall macroeconomic environment, to drive between 60 and 100 basis points of margin improvement, which is continuing to fuel the earnings growth that, we laid out earlier in the call.\nNikhil Devnani: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Please go ahead.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks and good afternoon. Good to see the start of performance at the end of Q4. A lot of changes in e-commerce over the past couple of years. Obviously customer acquisition costs are going up a lot, and there's more competition in the market from global players. So I was hoping, Jamie, you could talk about maybe the evolution of e-commerce as you see it and the impact of some of those changes on eBay, and if that leads you to any modifications in sort of the focus category strategy. And maybe related to that with Gen AI, across the platform and the magical innovations. Is there any way to quantify the impact of some of those tests, if not from a volume or revenue - so maybe from listings velocity, or engagement levels with sellers and buyers, testing the tools that might be helpful? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so first let me talk about kind of the e-commerce piece. Specifically, we did customer acquisition costs. This is where eBay has a unique advantage. So first, the vast, vast majority of our traffic is organic. People coming to the eBay app or typing in ebay.com, which is a key benefit. The second is our ability to monetize users that we acquire across multiple categories, is a huge win for us. So, when you look at someone coming in into a single focus category, they end up shopping across categories on the site, usually more than they buy in other categories from that from that one initial acquisition. So our ability to kind of manage the CAC and the CLTV, is I think much different than others. And that's just based on the scale of what we have. I think our focus on non-new and seasoned, is very unique and our drive towards refurb, luxury, authentication, and the trust we put on the marketplace is a real differentiator for us. For example, we've seen the fourth straight quarter now of growth in our luxury business. Our refurbished business maintained double-digit growth all in a somewhat challenging macro environment. So that's unique. As we look at the generative AI, it's still early days. I can give you some of the early perspectives, but when I'm having a hard day, I go read the message boards about how consumers feel about these features that they're launching, because they just love it. They love the speed with, which it allows them to get more inventory on the site. And what we hear is, this is going to lock more of their things in their closet, and their garage, because we're speeding up the listing process. So today, it's already been used by millions of sellers, our first version of the magical listing process, and over 90% of customers actually take the content that we have and include it in their listing. It has a satisfaction score of 80, which is very high for a brand new release on the product, and continues to get better each day. And then, we've had our other products and employee beta, and now out to a single percentage point of our customers, things like the enhanced background that I talked about. And I've been around this business for 20 years. There is nothing that moves product, like better pictures on the marketplace. It's why we now have larger pictures on our desktop view item. But the quality now of being able to take a picture that you take on your rug or even on your unmade bed, and put it on a beautiful background and make the product look more appealing for sale, we're excited to be able to get features like that out. So, we'll continue to update you on the progress, but I can tell you that the anecdotal feedback is really good, the quantitative numbers, of what we're seeing is helpful, and the pace of innovation around AI is exciting.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ken, your line is on mute.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Sorry about that. Sorry, my fault. I was on mute. Sorry about that. Could you - I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about \u2013 you've talked about - some of the weakness you've seen and continue to see in the macro side, especially in Europe. Could you talk about if there are certain cluster segments, or even categories that you're seeing better trends, or improving trends relative to those that might be still under pressure?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. What I would say is that, if you look at both U.K. and Germany, two of our largest markets, they're both experiencing a GDP decline. So U.K., which is our second largest market, entered a technical recession. If you look at the cost of living challenges that are happening over there, that's obviously been a challenge. And the German business has been in recession and is still experiencing negative e-commerce growth from that standpoint. But one of the unique values of eBay is that, we offer great values on the marketplace. So, I think the reason that our refurbished business, for example, is so strong, our luxury business is so strong, is that even in challenging times, people are looking for a value on the marketplace. And so, I would say I'd call out specific areas like that. Refurbished growing double-digits, I think, is a sign of the consumer looking for value. Also, the consumer was looking for a lot of value in December, and we really lean into that, across the globe. And that's been a big differentiator for us. And our parts and accessories business, continues to perform well. It grew mid-single digits for the fourth straight quarter, and consumers looking for a value in what we offer there. So, some puts and takes across categories, but those are the ones that, I think I would highlight, and what we see happening, especially over in Europe.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. I guess I asked about buyers. You talk about your GMV getting back to growth. What will we see with buyers, and what are you seeing within the metrics as far as churn, or new activations that give you encouragement right now? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, our buyers are exactly where we expected them to be. When you think about our enthusiast buyers, which is what we really track and go after. We said that, we would see a stabilization, coming off of the COVID time period, and that's what we're exactly seeing. It was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter at $16 million. We've been driving, healthy buyer acquisition and buyer retention, especially in our focus categories. Our enthusiast buyers are spending over $3,000, which is essentially like membership level spends, when you think about it. So, our acquisition is healthier year-over-year. Our reactivation is healthier year-over-year, and our churn is down year-over-year. So, we're pleased with what we're seeing on the buyer side, and we're continuing to lead in with new advancements and capabilities for buyers. What I called out on the call is things like, we have over 100 million vehicles stored in my garage, and we're using now predictive maintenance, to say it's time to change, this element for your car. Here's the parts on eBay that fit it exactly. They're backed by guaranteed fit. So, we continue to build new tools for buyers, to activate them onto the site and drive retention, and that's been working very well.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Jamie, I just wanted to follow-up on generative AI. Your comments were pretty interesting on, how your large language models from scratch are working better. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about that, some of the advantages that you're seeing. And then, as you're doubling GPUs through '24, maybe, Steve, can you talk a little bit about the impact there, just on the product development bucket and how we should think about that in context of the deleverage that we saw last year on that line? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Doug. One of the things I'm excited by is that, we've had this model of building in a hybrid environment, and having extremely large private cloud, which has allowed us to manage our cost infrastructure, even as we've grown to, now close to 2 billion listings on the marketplace. But more importantly, the benefit of being able to take our 30 years of really rich data of e-commerce and combine that in a hybrid sense, in some cases with open source LLMs. In some cases LLMs that we built, in another case with commercial LLMs, makes us able to do those, in a really efficient manner, without really massively impacting our cost structure, in any meaningful way. Also, having good latency in terms of getting it back, and also being able to fine tune the quality of the data of what's coming back from an inference has been important for us. So, we've used across the board all different models. We started, in some cases, with some commercial models and then moved those to open source, or internal models and as we've refined them and gotten better. And that's been working out really well for us. Like I said earlier to the question about magical listing, when we look at the scale and volume of the millions of listings that we get each day and what consumers are hitting us with. Making sure that we have, an incredible amount of quality in terms of what's happening with the AI and ease of use. And thus far, really positive feedback from it. The models are working well. And what's great is that the team iterates every single week, to make them better. Steve, maybe you just want to cover how we're managing the cost.\nSteve Priest: Yes of course, Jamie. Hi Doug, good to speak to you. As Jamie said, we're really excited about the opportunity, to drive further efficiencies and improve productivity, across eBay through the AI technology. We're doubling our GPU capacity in the first quarter, which is going to give us a lot, of expanded capabilities, specifically regarding to costs. The costs associated with Gen AI, including our GPU racks, are contemplated in our full year CapEx guidance range, which we laid out. And it's pretty much in line with historical averages. All the OpEx costs are contemplated on our guide. I think it's fair to say, our size and scale at eBay, is a distinct advantage, when it comes to this sort of additional infrastructure investment.\nJamie Iannone: The last thing I'd say is that, that refers a lot to how we're using it with our consumers. I would say internally across the organization, we're also pushing very aggressively, to drive productivity in the organization. So whether that be all of our engineers now using copilot tools as they do development in our customer support centers, we've been using AI to really change the level of engagement we have with customers and the productivity. I call it the success of our employees there, where we summarize contacts from customers to make it easier, summarize initial responses, all the things that we can do, when you think about our scale of, over a million self-service queries a week, in a customer service perspective, AI is incredibly helpful there. So those are just two examples of how we're using it across the board, to drive productivity in the organization.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you both. Very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for the question. So your U.S. business is stabilized at this point and is presumably set to return to growth sooner than the total. This is obviously happening in the face of U.S. e-commerce competition that has grown increasingly intense, with the introduction of low price Chinese competitors. Can you spend some time talking about, how your strategy of leading into enthusiasts and enthusiasts categories perhaps shields you, from this incremental competition. And any update holistically on maybe some of the vertical players, and some of your key focus categories, and how competition has evolved over the last year?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, specifically on the low price, and if you're referring to like the [T-Move] machine, we really haven't seen a significant impact from them on our business. We really have a differentiated strategy, with what we're doing with our focus categories and going after non-new in season, for the business. And years ago, we really moved away from the low ASP, low quality items on our marketplace. And that hasn't been a focus for us for many years now. So I think, that's the first key differentiation I'd call out. The second is that, obviously some of the competition is spending a lot of money from a marketing standpoint in the marketplace. But one of the great benefits of eBay, is just the vast amount of organic traffic we have. The vast, vast part of our traffic either comes directly to the app or types in eBay.com. So, we're less reliant on paid from that perspective. The last thing I'd say comes back to kind of the CAC, CLTV question, which is, we can have one of the most healthiest CACs out there in the marketplace, because of our ability to drive CLTV, really driving by the moves we've made to not be focused on active buyers, but really on acquiring enthusiast buyers, or quickly moving new buyers up to, become enthusiast buyers. And because of the cross category shopping nature of the business allows us to drive that CLTV higher for us. And then finally, the opportunity to turn them into sellers, or to have buyers who sell on the marketplace also helps with that overall equation. And those are really key differentiators for us at business and why we feel really well positioned on a go forward basis in the e-commerce landscape.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nThomas Champion: Hi good afternoon. Jamie, I'm wondering, if you could a little bit more about the C2C initiative in Germany, and maybe what's one or two key features that allowed you to, crack the code therein in that geography. I know it's been for a while. And then where do take this next, I mean presumably does it port to the U.K. How do you think about it, extending in other geographies? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, when you think about our focus category strategy of really kind of leaning in on this specific area, driving the CSAT to a whole double-digit level, we essentially apply that to a certain segment of our business in Germany to our C2C segment. And that's exactly what we're seeing, Tom is, greater than 20 point improvement in NPS in that business, which is really great for us. It's an important business. And what we really focused on was designing around the needs of the buyer. So that's searching SEO improvements, specifically around language needs in that market. The second was, really a focus on local and things like map based browsing in that market. Given the geography of it, we have more of that type of business in Germany than we do, for example, in our U.S. business and leaning into it. And the third is doing pricing adjustments for our C2C business there, really leaning in to being able to drive buyers, who sell and bring more C2C inventory on the marketplace. And that's been working well for us. We've seen double-digit increases in buyers who sell on the platform and a really kind of healthy business there in terms of first gen listings, that type of thing. So, with everything that we do, we look at, what's successful, what do we take to other markets, and we'll continue to do that and look at that on a go forward basis. But overall, we feel really good about the metrics that we're seeing in Germany, and the health of the business and the strong numbers we're putting up despite negative e-commerce growth in that marketplace.\nThomas Champion: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morton from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morton: Hi. Thank you for the question. Two, if I could. Just following up on the opportunities around AI, there's a view in the market that it allows you to run more sophisticated campaigns when you have large SKU offerings for big e-commerce platforms. So wondering, if you're seeing a benefit of that now, or if it's something that's always been a part of your business. And then we haven't seen the filing yet, but for the prior quarters, a lot of strength appears coming from China-based sellers. So just wondering about moving parts there, and the sustainability of that in 2024? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, look, the expansiveness of our marketplace, is what allows us to really go after launching compelling Gen AI features. So specifically in parts and accessories, for example, we use AI to expand the fitment capabilities of finding what vehicles a part will fit. But now we're using it for things like predictive maintenance and things like that. The vast majority of categories are really relevant for these horizontal innovations, things like magical listings, things like backgrounds, enhancers, et cetera. So search uses AI, advertising uses AI. So across the board, we're using it in very compelling places. We use it in our marketing to do much more personalized marketing, things like subject lines that can be really tailored based on what's happening on the business. When I think about our CBT business, it remains very strong on the marketplace. So, we've built more and more features to make CBT easier for both buyers and sellers. I'd call out the work that we did in payments on buyer and seller FX, really making that seamless. We've talked over the last two quarters about eBay international shipping with the concept of really opening up the 190 different geographies that we have around the world, to our sellers from that perspective. And so, it will continue to be a focus, will continue to make it easier and easier for buyers and sellers, to interact across borders and drive that strategy forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexandra Steiger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexandra Steiger: Great, thank you for squeezing me in. I do want to follow-up on some of your macro comments. So how should we think about GMV, or revenue per buyer in that context? To what extent do you see customers trading down in certain markets? Or is it more of a function of buyers making less purchases over a given period of time? And if that's the case, what are kind of like the key initiatives you're working on, to drive purchase frequency on the platform? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, so, when you look at it overall, when you talk about something like the U.K. or Germany, where the consumer is more stretched in cost of living challenges, et cetera. We tend to lean into the deals and values on the marketplace. So refurbished, used. And so it's not really impacting as much their overall business with us, more so in terms of the categories and where they're buying. So, I'd probably say like refurbished is a good example. Refurbished growth is up double-digits. We've talked in the past that, macro has pressured the, spend and move some of the enthusiast buyers, to mid-value buyers. That's a little bit why, we see the enthusiast number flat quarter-on-quarter. But we're pleased with that stability in this environment, because it means, the eBay value proposition is really resonating for those customers. In terms of driving frequency, it's one way where we're looking at things like all the programs that we have, whether that's safe seller, or stores, or the marketing that we put out to our customers. We're now able to use generative AI, to make that experience so much richer. The combination of our internal LLMs, and the data that we have about what's been happening over the 30 plus years. Combined with the ability to really build compelling marketing, to those customers, is coming to a whole new level. And Alexandra, I think we're just at the early stages of what's possible there. And what's exciting at eBay is the canvas that, we have to work with. When you think about, the number of consumers that have transacted with a given seller on the platform and have saved that seller. When you think about 100 million vehicles being in my garage, when you think about, the sizing data that we have for people for apparel, it gives us the unique ability to drive a lot of frequency on the platform.\nJohn Egbert: Operator, can we do one last question, please?\nOperator: We have no further questions in our queue at this time. And with that, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the first quarter and the full year and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. I'm pleased that we met or exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q4 despite observing a softer demand environment during the early part of the quarter. Gross merchandise volume was nearly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew 3% to nearly $2.6 billion, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%. We delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we returned $379 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the fourth quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was nearly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of up 2 points to reported GMV growth. As we discussed last quarter, we observed softer demand for discretionary goods during the beginning of Q4 as consumers dealt with elevated inflation from higher interest rates in our key markets. Shoppers were more discerning in their purchase behavior as we approach the holidays and the promotional environment adapted to meet their expectations. However, we started to see our business improve towards the end of November, particularly in the U.S., driven by consumers looking for value to stretch their limited holiday budgets. Additionally, we believe recent product improvements modestly benefited our participation in last minute holiday shopping. These included improved accuracy of our estimated delivery dates and product changes we made in Q4 to better highlight listings with faster shipping times. Focused categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. P&A Refurbished and Luxury with the top three contributors to GMV growth in focused categories. P&A delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit GMV growth as improved trust from programs like Guaranteed Fit and growing shipment coverage continue to benefit the overall customer experience. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q4, an improvement of 1 point sequentially. The U.S. consumer demand was notably more resilient relative to our largest international markets, consistent with market benchmarks. The underlying growth was even stronger when we include U.S. buyer spending on cross-border goods. International GMV was down nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis and up 4% as reported due to FX tailwinds. While we saw resilient demand in the U.K. and Germany over the holidays e-commerce market growth in these countries remain challenged. The progress we made in Germany to improve the seller and buyer experiences, particularly within C2C, help mitigate a tough environment where e-commerce growth has been persistently negative. In the U.K., our GMV growth narrowed the gap to market as consumers continue to look for value during the holidays. We also benefited from the lapping of the Royal Mail strikes that impacted results in Q4 of 2022. Moving to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers were $132 million at the end of last year. Continuing the trend of stabilization in 2023 after a period of post-COVID rationalization in recent years. Enthusiast buyers remained approximately 16 million. Spend currency enthusiast was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually despite continued pressure on discretionary spending across our major geographies. Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.6 billion during the fourth quarter, up 3%, outpacing volume by over 3 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of over 1 point to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in Q4 was approximately 13.8%, down roughly 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal category and product mix partly offset by continued momentum in our advertising business and a modest tailwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate was roughly flat despite nearly 0.5 point of FX headwind. Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million and reached 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 30% and to $368 million or 30 points faster than volume. As Jamie discussed earlier, we saw a robust seller adoption of Promoted Listings advanced in Q4, driven by recent innovations like smart targeting on role-based campaigns. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7% during the quarter, improving 30 basis points sequentially and down roughly 3 points year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a headwind to margins of approximately 150 basis points in Q4 compared to a year ago. The remainder is largely attributable to continued investment in product development and the margin impact of recent M&A. As expected, eBay international shipping was no longer a drag on our operating margins in Q4. But this program weighed modestly on gross margins year-over-year. as its cost primarily fall within cost of revenue. Overall gross margin was down about 60 basis points year-over-year as modest headwinds from EIS were partly offset by efficiencies in cost of payments. Within G&A expense, we recognized a GAAP restructuring charge of $99 million in Q4 relating to our recent organizational changes as well as the GAAP accrual of $15 million related to pending legal matters. You will find more information on adjustments in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix of our earnings presentation. While additional details on the legal matters, will be provided in our upcoming 10-K. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07 in Q4, roughly flat year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $1.40 for the quarter, driven by unrealized gains in our equity investment portfolio. These gains were partly offset by stock-based compensation on the aforementioned GAAP restructuring charge. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was negative $3 million in Q4, consistent with our guidance for de minimis free cash flow is California's disaster tax relief program for 2023, delayed the majority of our annual cash tax payments until October. We ended the year with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $250 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $41 during Q4, and had $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $129 million in December or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% and cumulative free cash flow over that period. Turning to our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q4. Our Adevinta stake was valued at nearly $4.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion versus Q3. On November 21, a consortium led by Permira and Blackstone announced an offer to acquire Adevinta. This offer is proceeding as expected, and we continue to expect it to close in Q2. The public offer period expired on February 9 with 95% of shareholders accepting the offer which satisfies the requirement of at least 90% acceptance rate. We understand that the consortium is working expeditiously to achieve the remaining regulatory approvals and closes. Our add-in warrants were valued at over $360 million at the end of Q4. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including add-in share price and the probability of vesting. Moving to our outlook. We have started the year with relatively uneven demand across our major markets, with the U.K. and U.K. markets experiencing negative GDP growth and U.S. retail sales weaker than expected in January. The dynamic nature of the operating environment has been incorporated into our GMV outlook as well as a 1 point boost to GMV growth from the extra leap year day. For the first quarter, we expect between $18.2 and $18.5 billion of GMV, representing an FX-neutral decline of 2% to flat year-over-year or spot GMV decline of 1% or flat. We expect to generate revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.54 billion in Q1, representing FX-neutral growth between flat and 2% and year-over-year. Our forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by over 2 points on an FX-neutral basis, while FX represents close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We forecast Q1 non-GAAP operating margin between 29.6% and 30%, marking both a sequential and year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.19 and $1.23 in the first quarter, representing EPS growth between 7% and 11% year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent a 2-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q1. Now let me share some thoughts on the full year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macroeconomic environment this year, we expect our FX neutral GMV growth rate to turn positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by about 2 points on an FX-neutral basis. We expect FX to represent close to a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. We anticipate our take rate expansion to be primarily driven by continued healthy growth in advertising revenue throughout 2024, although we do face elevated year-over-year comps starting in the second quarter, due to our acceleration in 2023, along with continued secular headwinds within our third-party ads. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year. as we balance continued investments in tech, talent and marketing with organizational efficiencies, productivity gains and savings from our ongoing structural cost program. Our non-GAAP operating margin outlook includes a net benefit of approximately 40 basis points year-over-year, which is primarily driven by a change in accounting estimate associated to the extension of the useful life of data center equipment. Following an assessment of our servers and networking equipment in December, we determined it was appropriate to extend the accounting use for life from three years to four years. You can find more information on this policy change in our 10-K filing. Offsetting this benefit is an operating margin headwind of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year due to foreign exchange as we lapped sizable FX hedging gains in 2023. This is on top of the approximately 30 basis point year-over-year operating margin headwind we experienced in 2023 as we lap the more meaningful hedging gains in 2022. Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be stable between 4% and 5% of revenue, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which contemplates headwinds of $99 million in restructuring charges and $234 million from repatriation tax payments. As a reminder, these repatriation tax payments will remain a temporary headwind to free cash flow through 2025, which is the final year of an 8-year repayment schedule. Details on these tax payments are in the appendix section of our earnings presentation. For Q1, we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.27 per share to be paid out in March. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board recently increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing our total remaining authorization to approximately $3.4 billion. We are targeting at least $2 billion of share repurchases for the year, though the pacing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect to end 2024 with cumulative repurchases and dividends representing approximately 130% of free cash flow since the beginning of 2022, above our original target of 125% for the period. Given our top line assumptions, margin outlook, and healthy capital return expectations, we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year in 2024. In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution during 2023. Despite a very challenging macro environment, we saw underlying momentum in our business as GMV trends improved gradually through the year, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.24, of 3% for the full year. While we are planning our business around the assumption that the macro environment, will continue to be challenging, we remain incredibly confident in our strategy and our plan for 2024. Assuming no further degradation in the environment, we expect our investments in focus categories, local market and C2C initiatives, generative AI and other site-wide improvements to turn GMV growth positive in Q3 or Q4 of this year. Although we will continue to invest in our strategic pillars, we are committed to striking the right balance between expenses and revenue growth, and continuing to lead into cost efficiencies to drive 60 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2024. Our fortress balance sheet, enables us to increase our buybacks and dividends this year, leading to total capital return, to shareholders of approximately 130% of cumulative free cash flow, from 2022 to 2024. And I'm extremely pleased this financial plan allows us to target non-GAAP EPS growth, of between 8% to 10% year-over-year, demonstrating the earnings power of our business. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yes, indeed. Good afternoon, Nikhil. You're correct. Seasonally, Q1 has been our strongest quarter for operating margin for a while, because of the dynamics of that seasonality. A reminder, we have been driving that through a number of cost savings that we've been driving based on recent actions. And also the accounting policy change that we saw that we discussed in the prepared remarks. I am really pleased with the amount of diligence that we've gone through. The teams are leaning into cost efficiencies in the short-term while we continue to invest for the long-term sustainable growth of eBay. And we're pleased to be in a position to, based on no change in the overall macroeconomic environment, to drive between 60 and 100 basis points of margin improvement, which is continuing to fuel the earnings growth that, we laid out earlier in the call. Yes of course, Jamie. Hi Doug, good to speak to you. As Jamie said, we're really excited about the opportunity, to drive further efficiencies and improve productivity, across eBay through the AI technology. We're doubling our GPU capacity in the first quarter, which is going to give us a lot, of expanded capabilities, specifically regarding to costs. The costs associated with Gen AI, including our GPU racks, are contemplated in our full year CapEx guidance range, which we laid out. And it's pretty much in line with historical averages. All the OpEx costs are contemplated on our guide. I think it's fair to say, our size and scale at eBay, is a distinct advantage, when it comes to this sort of additional infrastructure investment."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we made in 2023 against our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts and our goal of returning eBay to long-term sustainable growth. Let's go over a few highlights from the full year. First, despite significant macro pressure on discretionary spending across our major markets, we saw organic year-over-year GMV growth improved during each quarter of 2023, resulting in GMV growth down roughly 1% for the full year. Focus category GMV grew by nearly 4%, outpacing the remainder of our business by roughly 7 points, and we exited 2023 at approaching 30% penetration. We stabilized our active and enthusiast buyer count as acquisition, reactivation and retention improved year-over-year. Our revenue grew 3% organically to over $10 billion. driven by continued momentum in first-party advertising, expansion of our financial services offerings and the launch of eBay International Shipping. And we made significant investments in tech talent and marketing to support our strategic pillars, including making meaningful strides towards establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. These results have demonstrated that we have the right strategy which has put us on a path to building a stronger, more resilient company. In service of that goal, last month, we announced significant organizational changes focused on removing layers and simplifying execution in order to better meet the needs of our customers. This involved the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 1,000 roles and begin to scale back our alternative workforce contracts. This restructuring better aligns our expenses with the growth of our business and I'm confident it will enable us to accelerate innovation while delivering long-term value for shareholders. Now turning to the fourth quarter. We generated $18.6 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q4, nearly flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 3% to $2.6 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, and we delivered $1.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share resulting in $4.24 of EPS for the full year. Our focus category strategy remained a significant driver of underlying growth during Q4. We focused category GMV outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 6 points, growing roughly 4% for the third straight quarter. Our momentum in Motors Parts & Accessories, or P&A, continued in the quarter, as volume growth held steady in the mid-single digits. Our eBay Guaranteed Fit programs have benefited buyer trust and retention across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, driving incremental GMV within P&A last year. During Q4, we began rolling out multi-warehouse shipping optimization to some of our largest U.S. P&A sellers that collectively manage millions of listings. B2C sellers can activate these tools via eBay APIs, and this enables buyers to see more accurate estimated delivery dates when purchasing from sellers with multiple warehouses, which has driven a measurable uplift in conversion for early adopters. In 2024, we plan to onboard sellers in other categories to utilize this technology and tighten delivery estimates across eBay more broadly. Our established position in P&A has led to more than 100 million vehicles being saved in the My Garage section of eBay by active customers. In addition to providing better fitment experiences, we are finding more ways to leverage this valuable data to drive utility for our customers. For example, last quarter, we introduced predictive maintenance that offers AI-driven auto part recommendations based on a vehicle's mileage. Features like this help eBay stay top of mind for customers looking for auto parts at a great value. The work we've done in the eBay Authenticity Guarantee program has also been a key driver of our focused category momentum and raising the level of trust on the marketplace. In Q4, we launched our eighth authentication center in Tokyo, Japan, our first center focused primarily on cross-border trade. Our Tokyo center is currently authenticating luxury handbags and will expand to other highest categories over time. Japan is one of the largest and fastest-growing market for personal luxury goods in the world, enabling our global buyers to tap into a wealth of inventory from the world's most exclusive brands with complete confidence. Earlier this month, we also expanded the Authenticity Guarantee Program to cover loose gemstones. This further extends our product coverage within fine jewelry with authentication from our existing partner, the Gemological Institute of America, a trusted authority for over nine decades. In addition to expanding focus categories, last year, we made a significant investment in Germany, our third largest country as measured by demand. We adopted a similar approach to our vertical playbook to address the unique needs of German consumers. These changes included language enhancements and improvements to search, SEO and recommendations, shipping and return label improvements and a complete overhaul of the local pickup experience. In January, we further improved local discovery in Germany by introducing a new MAP-based browsing experience, which services trending and recently listed items through an intuitive interface based on what's nearby and easy to pick up. Overall, our initiative in Germany has outperformed our initial expectations. We've observed C2C seller NPS and customer satisfaction both up 20 points or more versus our previous baselines. Our buyer NPS also increased by double digits as buyers who sell returned to positive growth following the initiative launch. In addition, enhancements made to our QR code technology has helped reduce unpaid items by more than 50% for local pickups. And importantly, C2C volume in Germany returned to positive growth resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV relative to our prior trajectory. These investments have made our business significantly more resilient to the challenging macro environment in Germany where overall e-commerce growth has been negative in recent quarters. During 2023, we also laid the groundwork to accelerate our capabilities in artificial intelligence and further embed AI throughout the customer experience and our organization. After the first commercial large language models became available from companies like OpenAI and others last year, we immediately found ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve the eBay experience across selling, buying, advertising and marketing. Within a few months, we began fine-tuning open-source LLMs using eBay's proprietary commerce data on our own infrastructure. These models include a smaller number of parameters and thus operated faster and more cost efficiently than commercial LLM when operating at scale. But we also found these fine-tuned LLM could perform as well or in some cases, better than commercial LLM across certain dimensions and use cases, such as generating listing descriptions. To support an even more ambitious AI roadmap for 2024, by the end of Q1, we expect to have doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of last year. Importantly, this investment falls within our historical CapEx budget range of 4% to 5% of revenue. This added GPU capacity, combined with our existing infrastructure, allows us to develop LLMs from scratch pre-trained using eBay's nearly three decades worth of e-commerce data. While we'll continue to take a hybrid approach, leveraging both commercial and open-source LMs, we expect more generative AI services to be powered by internal LLM in 2024, helping make buying and selling on eBay simpler, faster and more magical. In terms of customer-facing features, we continue to iterate on our magical listing experience that has already been used by millions of sellers, which we believe makes it one of the most widely used Gen AI features in e-commerce to date. Generative AI descriptions have rolled out to 100% of users in our top 5 markets. Adoption trends remain healthy. Customer satisfaction continues to be at high levels as we've expanded outside of English-speaking countries and content acceptance rates remain above 90% through the full rollout. The next phase of our magical listing experience is currently being tested by up to 5% of C2C sellers on an opt-in basis. This experience is even more seamless as it leverages our image recognition technology and generative AI to prefill or suggest product titles, categories and other item aspects using photos alone. We are excited to make this experience available to more sellers in Q1 as early feedback from beta users has been incredibly encouraging. I'm also pleased to see the potential benefits our AI tools can have on the billions of listing images across our marketplace as high-quality products photos can have a significant impact on conversion on eBay. Last quarter, we completed the global rollout of our revamped background removal tool in our listing flows, which leverages AI to effortlessly remove background noise from their product images. This tool has enabled sellers to create cleaner, more professional product images and it has received rave reviews from our customers. Building on top of this, we're now leveraging generative AI to make sellers product images even more compelling using our new background swap tool. This feature allows sellers to show their products alongside a wide variety of AI-generated backgrounds. For example, you can display a pair of Air Jordan sneakers on a hardwood basketball court or showcase your preowned hiking boots a top of Pictures Mountain Summit. We are currently testing this feature in beta with 1% of sellers on iOS devices, and I'm excited to see more sellers leveraging these tools to enhance their product images and drive conversion. Now turning to our advertising business, which delivered another strong quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $393 million, while first-party ads outpaced volume by 30 points. For the full year, we generated over $1.4 billion of total advertising revenue, up roughly 25% for the year and more than double our ad revenue in 2019. The over 2.9 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q4, and we currently have over 900 million live promoted listings. Our standard cost per acquisition product remained the largest contributor to year-over-year ads growth in Q4. But notably, Promoted Listings advanced, our cost per click unit was the largest contributor to sequential advertising growth. Our CPC revenue and overall advertiser count benefited from the launch of rule-based campaigns in Q4, which allows sellers to automatically promote new listings based on rules that set for inclusion, such as price range, category, brand or condition. Additionally, during Q4, we launched a top-picks carousel for search. which provides a curated set of promoted listings ads comprised of hyper-relevant top-selling items from our highest ranked sellers. Thus far, buyers have been highly engaged with these ads providing added velocity for our sellers. Next, I'd like to share a few milestones around our sustainability efforts last year, starting with eCommerce. eCommerce continues to provide significant value for sellers and buyers during these uncertain times. In 2023, our marketplace generated nearly $4.9 billion in positive economic impact due to sale of pre-loved and refurbished goods. This activity helped avoid approximately 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would typically be used in producing new goods and kept nearly 70,000 metric tons of waste from going into landfills. Additionally, eBay remains committed to enabling more green energy on the U.S. electricity grid. As part of these ambitions, we have entered into agreements for three offsite renewable energy projects over the past four years. Our portion of the latest project is now fully operational, and the green energy produced will be roughly equivalent to the annual energy usage at our data center in Salt Lake City. Combined with our other two projects, this green energy covers over 40% of our global electricity consumption. And I'm incredibly proud that we source over 90% of our energy consumption for eBay controlled offices and data centers from renewable sources overall, and we remain on track to reaching our 100% renewable target by 2025. Now let's turn to impact. I'm always amazed by the tremendous generosity of the eBay community. eBay for Charity enables sellers and buyers to raise more than $43 million in Q4 and nearly $162 million for the full year. The eBay Foundation granted more than $19 million in 2023 to support historically excluded entrepreneurs and through our employee gift-matching program. I'm honored to be a purpose-driven company that supports communities around the world. For the fifth year in a row, eBay was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices. eBay was also included once again in Just Capital and CNBC's list of America's most just companies which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their incredible work and bringing our strategy to life and their tireless support in our community worldwide amid ongoing challenges in the global economy. In closing, while we continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment, I'm incredibly optimistic about our roadmap for 2024. Our teams are better organized for speed, allowing us to be nimble and make critical decisions more quickly. The foundational AI capabilities we developed last year make us well positioned to unlock the power of our data assets, fundamentally change the customer experience on eBay, and drive efficiency across the company in 2024. We will continue to invest in new and existing focus categories while also improving country-specific experiences like we did in Germany last year. We expect continued momentum in first-party advertising, despite lapping outstanding growth in the prior year, while we grow our financial service offerings for customers. And from a financial standpoint, we are in a strong position to expand margins, drive robust earnings growth and deliver healthy capital returns to shareholders in 2024, while still investing in high ROI initiatives to keep us on the path towards sustainable GMV growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes, thanks, Nikhil. I'll cover the GMV one and then I'll ask Steve to talk about margin. So, when we looked at the start of the year here, we talked about, January having some weather impact. You heard that from other folks as well and improvements kind of since then. You saw, January retail sales show the consumer is a bit stretched. But when we look at the overall plan that we have for the year, we feel really good about the strategy that we're executing on. When you look at focus categories, they continue to outperform the rest of the business. For FY '23, it was a 4% year-over-year growth, about seven points ahead of the business. We like what we saw in terms of the investments that we made in Germany and feel really good about the roadmap that we have in front of us, to drive growth in the business in Q3 or Q4, as Steve outlined. You know, I think importantly, when we look at the kind of underlying health of the business, right now we still have U.K. just in our technical recession, Germany commerce growth is still in negative territory. And so, we have those impacts from the market, but the underlying business and what's happening in the core, we feel really good about. And that's what makes us confident in being able to drive GMV growth as we outline there. Steve, do you want to talk about margin? Yes, so first let me talk about kind of the e-commerce piece. Specifically, we did customer acquisition costs. This is where eBay has a unique advantage. So first, the vast, vast majority of our traffic is organic. People coming to the eBay app or typing in ebay.com, which is a key benefit. The second is our ability to monetize users that we acquire across multiple categories, is a huge win for us. So, when you look at someone coming in into a single focus category, they end up shopping across categories on the site, usually more than they buy in other categories from that from that one initial acquisition. So our ability to kind of manage the CAC and the CLTV, is I think much different than others. And that's just based on the scale of what we have. I think our focus on non-new and seasoned, is very unique and our drive towards refurb, luxury, authentication, and the trust we put on the marketplace is a real differentiator for us. For example, we've seen the fourth straight quarter now of growth in our luxury business. Our refurbished business maintained double-digit growth all in a somewhat challenging macro environment. So that's unique. As we look at the generative AI, it's still early days. I can give you some of the early perspectives, but when I'm having a hard day, I go read the message boards about how consumers feel about these features that they're launching, because they just love it. They love the speed with, which it allows them to get more inventory on the site. And what we hear is, this is going to lock more of their things in their closet, and their garage, because we're speeding up the listing process. So today, it's already been used by millions of sellers, our first version of the magical listing process, and over 90% of customers actually take the content that we have and include it in their listing. It has a satisfaction score of 80, which is very high for a brand new release on the product, and continues to get better each day. And then, we've had our other products and employee beta, and now out to a single percentage point of our customers, things like the enhanced background that I talked about. And I've been around this business for 20 years. There is nothing that moves product, like better pictures on the marketplace. It's why we now have larger pictures on our desktop view item. But the quality now of being able to take a picture that you take on your rug or even on your unmade bed, and put it on a beautiful background and make the product look more appealing for sale, we're excited to be able to get features like that out. So, we'll continue to update you on the progress, but I can tell you that the anecdotal feedback is really good, the quantitative numbers, of what we're seeing is helpful, and the pace of innovation around AI is exciting. Yes. What I would say is that, if you look at both U.K. and Germany, two of our largest markets, they're both experiencing a GDP decline. So U.K., which is our second largest market, entered a technical recession. If you look at the cost of living challenges that are happening over there, that's obviously been a challenge. And the German business has been in recession and is still experiencing negative e-commerce growth from that standpoint. But one of the unique values of eBay is that, we offer great values on the marketplace. So, I think the reason that our refurbished business, for example, is so strong, our luxury business is so strong, is that even in challenging times, people are looking for a value on the marketplace. And so, I would say I'd call out specific areas like that. Refurbished growing double-digits, I think, is a sign of the consumer looking for value. Also, the consumer was looking for a lot of value in December, and we really lean into that, across the globe. And that's been a big differentiator for us. And our parts and accessories business, continues to perform well. It grew mid-single digits for the fourth straight quarter, and consumers looking for a value in what we offer there. So, some puts and takes across categories, but those are the ones that, I think I would highlight, and what we see happening, especially over in Europe. Yes, our buyers are exactly where we expected them to be. When you think about our enthusiast buyers, which is what we really track and go after. We said that, we would see a stabilization, coming off of the COVID time period, and that's what we're exactly seeing. It was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter at $16 million. We've been driving, healthy buyer acquisition and buyer retention, especially in our focus categories. Our enthusiast buyers are spending over $3,000, which is essentially like membership level spends, when you think about it. So, our acquisition is healthier year-over-year. Our reactivation is healthier year-over-year, and our churn is down year-over-year. So, we're pleased with what we're seeing on the buyer side, and we're continuing to lead in with new advancements and capabilities for buyers. What I called out on the call is things like, we have over 100 million vehicles stored in my garage, and we're using now predictive maintenance, to say it's time to change, this element for your car. Here's the parts on eBay that fit it exactly. They're backed by guaranteed fit. So, we continue to build new tools for buyers, to activate them onto the site and drive retention, and that's been working very well. Thanks, Justin. Yes, Doug. One of the things I'm excited by is that, we've had this model of building in a hybrid environment, and having extremely large private cloud, which has allowed us to manage our cost infrastructure, even as we've grown to, now close to 2 billion listings on the marketplace. But more importantly, the benefit of being able to take our 30 years of really rich data of e-commerce and combine that in a hybrid sense, in some cases with open source LLMs. In some cases LLMs that we built, in another case with commercial LLMs, makes us able to do those, in a really efficient manner, without really massively impacting our cost structure, in any meaningful way. Also, having good latency in terms of getting it back, and also being able to fine tune the quality of the data of what's coming back from an inference has been important for us. So, we've used across the board all different models. We started, in some cases, with some commercial models and then moved those to open source, or internal models and as we've refined them and gotten better. And that's been working out really well for us. Like I said earlier to the question about magical listing, when we look at the scale and volume of the millions of listings that we get each day and what consumers are hitting us with. Making sure that we have, an incredible amount of quality in terms of what's happening with the AI and ease of use. And thus far, really positive feedback from it. The models are working well. And what's great is that the team iterates every single week, to make them better. Steve, maybe you just want to cover how we're managing the cost. The last thing I'd say is that, that refers a lot to how we're using it with our consumers. I would say internally across the organization, we're also pushing very aggressively, to drive productivity in the organization. So whether that be all of our engineers now using copilot tools as they do development in our customer support centers, we've been using AI to really change the level of engagement we have with customers and the productivity. I call it the success of our employees there, where we summarize contacts from customers to make it easier, summarize initial responses, all the things that we can do, when you think about our scale of, over a million self-service queries a week, in a customer service perspective, AI is incredibly helpful there. So those are just two examples of how we're using it across the board, to drive productivity in the organization. Yes, specifically on the low price, and if you're referring to like the [T-Move] machine, we really haven't seen a significant impact from them on our business. We really have a differentiated strategy, with what we're doing with our focus categories and going after non-new in season, for the business. And years ago, we really moved away from the low ASP, low quality items on our marketplace. And that hasn't been a focus for us for many years now. So I think, that's the first key differentiation I'd call out. The second is that, obviously some of the competition is spending a lot of money from a marketing standpoint in the marketplace. But one of the great benefits of eBay, is just the vast amount of organic traffic we have. The vast, vast part of our traffic either comes directly to the app or types in eBay.com. So, we're less reliant on paid from that perspective. The last thing I'd say comes back to kind of the CAC, CLTV question, which is, we can have one of the most healthiest CACs out there in the marketplace, because of our ability to drive CLTV, really driving by the moves we've made to not be focused on active buyers, but really on acquiring enthusiast buyers, or quickly moving new buyers up to, become enthusiast buyers. And because of the cross category shopping nature of the business allows us to drive that CLTV higher for us. And then finally, the opportunity to turn them into sellers, or to have buyers who sell on the marketplace also helps with that overall equation. And those are really key differentiators for us at business and why we feel really well positioned on a go forward basis in the e-commerce landscape. Yes, when you think about our focus category strategy of really kind of leaning in on this specific area, driving the CSAT to a whole double-digit level, we essentially apply that to a certain segment of our business in Germany to our C2C segment. And that's exactly what we're seeing, Tom is, greater than 20 point improvement in NPS in that business, which is really great for us. It's an important business. And what we really focused on was designing around the needs of the buyer. So that's searching SEO improvements, specifically around language needs in that market. The second was, really a focus on local and things like map based browsing in that market. Given the geography of it, we have more of that type of business in Germany than we do, for example, in our U.S. business and leaning into it. And the third is doing pricing adjustments for our C2C business there, really leaning in to being able to drive buyers, who sell and bring more C2C inventory on the marketplace. And that's been working well for us. We've seen double-digit increases in buyers who sell on the platform and a really kind of healthy business there in terms of first gen listings, that type of thing. So, with everything that we do, we look at, what's successful, what do we take to other markets, and we'll continue to do that and look at that on a go forward basis. But overall, we feel really good about the metrics that we're seeing in Germany, and the health of the business and the strong numbers we're putting up despite negative e-commerce growth in that marketplace. Yes, look, the expansiveness of our marketplace, is what allows us to really go after launching compelling Gen AI features. So specifically in parts and accessories, for example, we use AI to expand the fitment capabilities of finding what vehicles a part will fit. But now we're using it for things like predictive maintenance and things like that. The vast majority of categories are really relevant for these horizontal innovations, things like magical listings, things like backgrounds, enhancers, et cetera. So search uses AI, advertising uses AI. So across the board, we're using it in very compelling places. We use it in our marketing to do much more personalized marketing, things like subject lines that can be really tailored based on what's happening on the business. When I think about our CBT business, it remains very strong on the marketplace. So, we've built more and more features to make CBT easier for both buyers and sellers. I'd call out the work that we did in payments on buyer and seller FX, really making that seamless. We've talked over the last two quarters about eBay international shipping with the concept of really opening up the 190 different geographies that we have around the world, to our sellers from that perspective. And so, it will continue to be a focus, will continue to make it easier and easier for buyers and sellers, to interact across borders and drive that strategy forward. Yes, so, when you look at it overall, when you talk about something like the U.K. or Germany, where the consumer is more stretched in cost of living challenges, et cetera. We tend to lean into the deals and values on the marketplace. So refurbished, used. And so it's not really impacting as much their overall business with us, more so in terms of the categories and where they're buying. So, I'd probably say like refurbished is a good example. Refurbished growth is up double-digits. We've talked in the past that, macro has pressured the, spend and move some of the enthusiast buyers, to mid-value buyers. That's a little bit why, we see the enthusiast number flat quarter-on-quarter. But we're pleased with that stability in this environment, because it means, the eBay value proposition is really resonating for those customers. In terms of driving frequency, it's one way where we're looking at things like all the programs that we have, whether that's safe seller, or stores, or the marketing that we put out to our customers. We're now able to use generative AI, to make that experience so much richer. The combination of our internal LLMs, and the data that we have about what's been happening over the 30 plus years. Combined with the ability to really build compelling marketing, to those customers, is coming to a whole new level. And Alexandra, I think we're just at the early stages of what's possible there. And what's exciting at eBay is the canvas that, we have to work with. When you think about, the number of consumers that have transacted with a given seller on the platform and have saved that seller. When you think about 100 million vehicles being in my garage, when you think about, the sizing data that we have for people for apparel, it gives us the unique ability to drive a lot of frequency on the platform."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the eBay Q3 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Mr. John Egbert, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nJohn Egbert : Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us for eBay's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary during the call, which is available through the investor relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com. Before we begin, I'll remind you that during this conference call we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our accompanying slide presentation. Additionally, all growth rates noted in our prepared remarks will reflect organic FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, and all earnings per share amounts reflect earnings per diluted share unless indicated otherwise. During this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our operating results and our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of November 7, 2023. We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid results during the third quarter. We generated gross merchandise volume of approximately $18 billion, while revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 3%, while returning over $780 million of capital to shareholders. We achieved these results despite continued challenges in the global macro environment. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and pressured demand for discretionary goods. As Steve will discuss in greater detail, we've observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4, and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays. We are focused on controlling what we can control, being prudent about our costs, leaning into operational efficiencies, and continuing to drive innovation for our customers. Last quarter, I discussed our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts, which is focused on three strategic pillars; Relevant Experiences, Scalable Solutions, and Magical Innovation. And I'm pleased that we made meaningful progress against each of these pillars during Q3, which I'll discuss in greater detail. I'll start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. Our relevance in focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business, and we've observed a meaningful improvement in our growth relative to the market in every category we've invested to date. Focus categories grew roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace in Q3. Year-to-date, our focus categories have grown at approximately 4% year-over-year. For context, we estimate market rates of growth in those same categories were in the low single digits on average during the first half of 2023, as several of these categories are comprised of highly discretionary goods, which have been more acutely impacted by the challenging macro environment. We continue to push the envelope of innovation in motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, by developing features that enhance our customer value proposition. These investments have fueled mid-single digit GMV growth for P&A for three consecutive quarters, which is in line with industry growth for this segment of e-commerce in our largest markets. The eBay Guaranteed Fit program has contributed to this momentum by delivering a game changing level of trust. This program enables tens of millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence, knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back, which has yielded a measurable uplift in conversion. Additionally, we have not observed a material impact on product returns, as our fitment checks have reduced the likelihood of buyers receiving a part that does not fit their vehicle. Given the success this program has had in the U.S., we were incredibly excited to roll out similar programs in the UK and Germany during Q3, where our unaided awareness among P&A shoppers is significantly higher than it is in the U.S. The Guaranteed Fit program is underpinned by multiple years of investment in P&A technology, including our acquisition of myFitment. We have been steadily onboarding sellers into the myFitment toolkit, to enhance their P&A listings with more robust fitment data, which improves findability for parts and protects buyers from unnecessary returns. By the end of Q3, roughly two-thirds of large U.S. P&A sellers have adopted the toolkit. On average, sellers are observing conversion uplift of double digits or higher for listings enhanced by this toolkit, driving incremental GMV for eBay. In early October, we reached a major milestone with 2 billion pieces of fitment data added to live listings using myFitment's technology. While this is outstanding progress, we continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding process, making it faster to import listings, and identifying more vehicle matches for our more than 550 million live P&A listings. During Q3, we continued to deliver relevant experiences for the collectibles category across a number of areas. We generated over $10 billion in GMV from collectibles over the last 12 months, and more than one in four eBay buyers purchased at least one collectibles item over the past year. These buyers carry some of the highest conversion, repurchase, and retention rates on eBay. And they are also among the heaviest cross-category shoppers on our platform, which supports our other categories. Our goal is to remain the world's most loved destination for passionate collectibles enthusiasts, providing access to the most compelling assortment of inventory across multiple categories in a high-trust environment. In service of that vision, during Q3 we launched direct submissions to the eBay vault. This enables any U.S. resident to send in trading cards valued at $250 or higher from their personal collections to the vault, even if they were not purchased on eBay. In July, to coincide with the National Sports Collectors Convention, the industry's biggest event, we announced Vault Enhanced Submission, which now enables us to gather large amounts of high ASP cards in person at tent pole events attended by top collectors. During one weekend at the National Loan [ph], we added tens of millions of dollars of assets under management to the eBay vault, including a signed Jackie Robinson card valued at approximately $1 million. During Q3, we also wrote out a revamped condition grading system for trading cards, which greatly improves transparency for collectibles in this category. New listings now carry more precise details, including whether a card has been professionally graded and the numerical grade, or one of several predefined card conditions. Existing listings will be also migrated to the new standard over the coming months. Sellers have been asking us for this feature for some time, and we believe it will drive improved trust for buyers, better and more consistent price realization for sellers, as well as more robust data and insights around individual card values for eBay. In response to our growing community of collectors and enthusiasts, last year we introduced eBay Live, an interactive live shopping experience within the eBay app. This feature marries eBay's unique scale with an engaging shopping experience that we believe enthusiasts across the collectibles, luxury and fashion categories are increasingly seeking. Buyers can interact with influential sellers and check out in real time without leaving the stream. And sellers have loved this tool as they can move items at scale and increase their sales velocity, while listing items as fixed price or as extended auctions. eBay Live is currently in beta, but we continue to expand its availability to more sellers and categories. While we've been thoughtful about the pace of onboarding as we fine-tune the beta experience, Q3 marked an inflection point as we hosted over 1,000 live events, saw our millionth buyer tune in, and grew GMV from eBay Live by 4x quarter-over-quarter. Now, let me turn to the second pillar of our evolve strategy, Scalable Solutions. We're pleased with the progress we're making with our eBay International Shipping Program or EIS, which makes cross-border trade more seamless and cost-effective for sellers and buyers. We continue to scale EIS during Q3 and now have over 400 million live listings from U.S. sellers shippable to international buyers in more than 190 countries. Sellers have had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the new program, with customer satisfaction rates approximately 30 points higher than the previous global shipping program it replaced. In October, we launched Combined Shipping for EIS, which allows buyers to order multiple items from an international seller and pay one consolidated shipping fee. Q3 also marked another strong quarter for our advertising business. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million. First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or 36 points faster than FX-neutral GMV growth. Over 2.3 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q3, and we currently have over 850 million live promoted listings. Promoted Listing Standard, our cost per acquisition ad unit, was once again the largest contributor to growth in Q3, driven by continued optimization of placements, ad rate improvements, and the recurring benefit of the halo attribution change we discussed last quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click product, was the fastest growing product in our ads portfolio on a year-over-year basis. PL Advanced continues to benefit from the simplifying and automating of core elements of the campaign setup and management processes. In September, we launched Smart Targeting for PL Advanced, which makes creating and managing CPC campaigns easier than ever. Previously, these campaigns took a lot of time to set up and manage, as sellers had to manually select keywords and manage campaigns individually. Now, through Smart Targeting, eBay uses AI to manage keywords on behalf of sellers and optimize campaigns dynamically, all with just a few clicks to set up. As part of the Smart Targeting launch, we've also extended CPC ads to the Similar Items Recommendations module when users are viewing another item, using fully automated targeting and bidding technology. Moving to our third pillar, Magical Innovations. Last quarter, we discussed our Magical Listing experience, which represents the biggest transformation of the eBay listing process in our 28-year history. For over two decades, two of our biggest focuses were at odds with each other, making it as simple and fast as possible to list an item and ensuring listings are rich and comprehensive to maximize sales. Now Generative AI allows us to leverage our treasure trove of images and listing data to quickly create compelling listings. Early users have told us these capabilities will unlock more of the inventory in their closets and garages, which could ultimately keep more products out of landfills. The first phase of our magical listing experience leverages Generative AI to instantly populate the item description within the listing flow based on a product's title, category and other aspects. This feature rolled out to 100% of mobile app users in the U.S., UK, and Germany during Q3. In October, we extended the Generative AI descriptions to 50% of desktop users in these countries. The first phase of the magical listing experience has been incredibly well received by sellers as usage, adoption, customer satisfaction, and content acceptance rates have all been higher than expected. As much as sellers have enjoyed the first phase of Magical Listing, we believe the next iteration will be so simple and easy to use that all of our sellers will love it. This experience will enable sellers to point their camera at an item, take a photo, and eBay does the rest. Behind the scenes, we have powered this experience with our proprietary computer vision technology and Generative AI to seamlessly populate the description, category, and any other item aspects. Our camera-based magical listing experience has been in employee beta for several months and is currently in a limited beta with a number of large sellers. Feedback from our beta sellers has been extremely positive, as they found the new experience intuitive and easier to use. We are incredibly excited to bring this experience to more sellers over the coming months. As part of our magical listing initiative, we also rolled out a vastly improved background removal tool powered by AI during Q3. Sellers have told us that simpler, cleaner images of their products have a significant impact on conversion. Our enhanced tool has now rolled out to all users in the core listing flow, and sellers have told us they are already noticing significant quality and performance improvements from the revamped tool versus our prior version. Overall, I'm incredibly pleased by the progress we are making across all three pillars of our strategy. It is particularly encouraging to see how recent advancements in AI and machine learning can help us address more long-standing pain points for sellers and buyers on eBay in efficient and scalable ways. Next, I'd like to highlight the impact we're having on the communities we serve. In Q3 we released our Second Annual Small Business Report, which examines the sentiment of our global sellers. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, eBay sellers are confident they can build their businesses and give back to their communities. In fact, more than half of eBay sellers expect their overall business to grow in the next 12 months, and over two-thirds expect their businesses on eBay to increase over the next five years. We also recently announced the winners of our Up & Running Grants. This program is currently in its fourth year and provides entrepreneurs with capital to invest in their businesses, along with training and mentorship to help them grow and thrive. The third quarter also marked the 20th anniversary of eBay for Charity, a program created as a way for people to give back during times of crisis. It has evolved to a global platform supporting countless organizations and causes, and raised more than $1.3 billion for nonprofits to date. In Q3 alone, the eBay community raised $40 million, up 16% year-over-year. All of these efforts demonstrate our purpose-driven community, and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. We're proud to be ranked on the U.S. News & World Report's inaugural list of best companies to work for. eBay was also recognized as a top corporate philanthropist by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and San Francisco Business Times. In closing, I'd like to thank our extraordinary eBay team for delivering another solid quarter and continuing to innovate for our customers. We made significant progress against our long-term objectives during Q3. Our accelerating pace of innovation is fundamentally changing the eBay experience, driving higher customer satisfaction, and paving the way for new growth and revenue opportunities. As the macro environment remains uncertain, we'll be balanced in how we invest in the future, prioritizing our highest ROI investments in order to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest : Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the third quarter on slide 11 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic, effect-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. Q3 was another solid quarter for eBay as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to approximately $18 billion. Revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion, outpacing volume by five points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we generated $777 million of free cash flow, while returning $783 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% organically to approximately $18 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year on a total FX neutral basis. Foreign exchange represented a nearly two-point tailwind to reported GMV growth. However, the U.S. dollar appreciation during the quarter created a GMV headwind of more than $100 million versus rates implied in our Q3 outlook. Focus categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace. P&A was once again the largest contributor to growth and maintained mid-single-digit GMV growth for the third straight quarter, in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished was the fastest-growing focus category on a percentage basis, while GMV growth in our Luxury focus categories was positive for the third straight quarter, as our combination of value and quality has served customers well in the current economic environment. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 2% organically in Q3, an improvement of over two points sequentially. On a total FX neutral basis, U.S. GMV was down 1%. Although the U.S. economy has been more resilient than our other markets, demand for discretionary goods continues to be impacted by the cumulative burden of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates observed in over a decade. U.S. consumers are increasingly seeking value, which has shifted some demand to inventory offered by our CBT sellers. International GMV was roughly flat on an FX neutral basis, and at nearly 4% as reported. Our international markets continue to experience more severe macroeconomic pressure than the U.S., with the UK seeing consistently negative e-commerce growth since early 2022, while Germany has now faced multiple quarters of economic contraction. This pressure has been mitigated by continued strength in cross-border trade, which offset far weaker trends in Europe. Moving to buyers, trading 12-month active buyers was stable quarter-over-quarter at $132 million. On an organic basis, active buyers remained at approximately $131 million for the third straight quarter. Enthusiast buyers were also flat sequentially at $16 million. Spend per enthusiast was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually, but modestly year-over-year. Turning to revenue, we generated revenue of $2.5 billion during the third quarter, at 4% organically, outpacing volume by five points. Total FX neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A was 5%, while currency had a de-minimis impact to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9%, down modestly quarter-over-quarter, but up nearly 50 basis points year-over-year. The combination of FX and the ads revenue recognition change in Q2 represented a sequential take rate headwind of over 10 basis points in Q3. Advertising was again the largest tailwind to our take rate on a year-over-year basis, and also quarter-over-quarter after adjusting for the Q2 accounting change. eBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate added five basis points to our take rate sequentially. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million and reached just over 2% penetration of GMV. First party ads grew 36% to $345 million or roughly 36 points faster than FX mutual volume. As noted last quarter, the revenue deferral release for CPC ads in Q2 created a sequential headwind of $9 million to first party ad revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased with the continued robust growth in promoted listings, year-over-year growth decelerated slightly as we lacked a notable acceleration during the prior year period, which was driven by a series of performance optimizations. Our legacy third party display ads, which have been impacted by a combination of secular and macro headwinds in recent quarters, decelerated further during Q3. In recent months, we have actively deprecated third party ads in certain circumstances to improve the user experience. Third party ads remain our primary focus as we continue to invest in scaling, optimizing and automating our promoted listings portfolio. Financial services had a modestly positive impact on our take rate sequentially. As our in-house payments capabilities have advanced in recent quarters, we have identified more opportunities for GMV, revenue and cost optimization. Adyen continues to be an incredibly strategic partner for us in financial services. During Q3, we expanded our usage of Adyen\u2019s Merchant Acquiring Services to cover additional forms of payments. This development has positive implications for our Adyen Warrant probability, which I will discuss shortly. Moving to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4% during the quarter, down roughly 2.5 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.1 points of this delta was driven by the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping Program. Foreign Exchange also represents the year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points. The remainder of the margin variance was driven by investments in our business and modest volume de-leverage. Gross margin was down nearly 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily from the ramp of eBay International Shipping. Within our operating expenses, we observed a 1 point increase in product development expense as we invested in product and engineering talent to drive innovation across eBay. Sales and marketing was down modestly as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3, as our investments in full-frontal marketing initiatives were offset by cost efficiencies, including lower spend on coupons and incentives. During the quarter, we also accrued an additional $50 million to G&A expense on a GAAP basis related to pending legal matters. This adjustment is reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliation, while additional details on the accrual will be provided in our 10-Q filing. We continue to focus on driving expenses out of the business, which is a crucial part of our path to long-term sustainable growth. And where we do choose to invest, we are able to partially offset that with OpEx savings given by our structural cost program. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation, we generated free cash flow of $777 million in Q3, up 23%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.4 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased over $650 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3, and had $1.7 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization at the quarter end. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends or roughly 125% of cumulative free cash flow over that period. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, benefiting from a nearly 4% reduction in share count from our repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $2.46, with a delta driven by unrealized gains on our equity investment portfolio, primarily from Adevinta. Our investment portfolio is detailed on slide 21 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued over $4.5 billion at the end of Q3. Our $404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $4 billion, at more than $1 billion versus the prior quarter. As we disclosed in late September, we have expressed support for the proposal made by the Consortium of Investors to Adevinta, under which we would retain a portion of our current holdings. As these discussions are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide any further comments on this transaction or the implications of such a transaction to eBay today. Our Adyen [ph] warrants were valued at nearly $200 million at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, our warrant value was calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of our remaining warrant tranches vesting. During Q3, the probability of vesting was positively impacted by an evolution in our usage of Adyen\u2019s products and services. The three remaining warrant tranches now carry probabilities ranging between 0% and 95%. However, the increasing probability was more than offset by a price decline in Adyen shares during the third quarter. Moving on to our outlook, although our third quarter volume trends were slightly better than expected, we did observe softening consumer demand in September that carried through October. This macro softness was most pronounced in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany, our second and third largest markets, respectively. We have also seen tapering demand in the U.S. market quarter to-date. Given these trends, our base case expectation is that continued pressure on discretionary demand will lead to a relatively muted seasonal uptick in volumes during the holiday season. For the fourth quarter, we expect to generate between $17.9 and $18.3 billion of GMV, representing an organic FX neutral decline of between 4% and 2% year-over-year, or spot growth between negative 2% and flat. The strengthening U.S. dollar also creates an incremental FX headwind to fourth quarter GMV of roughly $400 million versus our prior guidance on a spot basis. This is on top of more than $100 million FX headwind to Q3 GMV. On a sequential basis, we estimate FX will represent over a one-point headwind to GMV growth and nearly one point of pressure to revenue growth. We anticipate Q4 revenue between $2.47 and $2.53 billion represents organic FX neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 2% year-over-year. This implies revenue will outpace volume by three to four points on an organic FX neutral basis in Q4. As a reminder, our core take rate is typically down sequentially by 10 to 15 basis points in Q4 due to seasonal ASP and category mix, although this trend has occasionally been masked by payments and ads growth in the recent past. Given our tempered outlook for Q4 volume and continued uncertainty in the global economy, we believe it is prudent to lean in more heavily into cost efficiencies to protect margins and earnings in this environment. We forecast non-GAAP operating margins between 26.1% and 26.7% during Q4, which would yield margins near the high end of our prior guidance range for the full year. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.05, representing EPS growth between negative 6% and negative 2% year-over-year. At current rate, FX would represent a four-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q4, as we lack meaningful hedging gains in the prior year period. Our outlook for free cash flow of just under $2 billion this year remains unchanged. As I noted last quarter, we expect the minimum free cash flow in Q4 due to the delayed timing of cash tax payments in 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are expected between 4% and 5%, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. In relation to 2024, it is premature to offer specific commentary as we are in the midst of our planning process. We remain committed to finding an appropriate balance between growth and profitability to ensure we are positioned for durable financial returns in the years ahead. As such, we plan to grow expenses more slowly than revenue next year as we scale and leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. We will remain good stewards of capital as we continue to target returning 125% of cumulative free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases and dividends through 2024. We will target a certain level of capital returns from quarter-to-quarter, while maintaining the flexibility to lean in opportunistically when appropriate. In closing, our Q3 results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid continued challenges in the global economy. Our fortress balance sheet and operational discipline have enabled us to adapt to rapidly evolving demand environments, while continuing to invest for the future, protecting earnings and delivering meaningful capital returns to shareholders. I'm extremely proud of our team, for staying focused on our strategic pillars amid this uncertainty and further laying the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nColin Sebastian : Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate the questions. I guess first off, Jamie, there was some discussion at the Cellware conference a few weeks back about extending focus categories to more verticals. I think home and electronics were a couple of those in discussion. I wonder how quickly we should see focus coverage grow in proportion to total listings. And if that's true, is that something that could drive volume growth through 2024? And then Steve, I just wanted to go back to some of the macro factors you reviewed, and you mentioned I think your shift towards CBT. And just hoping you could discuss some of the implications of that shift on revenues and margins. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah Colin, thanks for the question. So as you know with focus categories, we don't pre-announce the next categories that we're going into for competitive reasons, etcetera. We do continue to roll out new areas, as well as invest back into areas of the business. So, have a look at this quarter. We launched UK authentication for jewelry in our UK business. We're actually opening up an authentication center in Japan to allow for cross-border trade out of Japan, which is great. We launched or expanded in P&A, our guaranteed fit program. So that had launched just in the U.S. We've seen great results by creating a game-changing level of trust in that category, and we've expanded that now to UK and Germany this quarter and we're excited to see the impact of that on those markets. Our other categories like refurbished continue to do well. We've seen double-digit growth from that perspective. We launched some new enhancements in trading cards this quarter with the new classification system that we've put in place and new direct submission in the Vault. So we're going to continue to balance new focus category opportunities, expansion to other categories like we did with jewelry in the UK, and like we did recently with Streetwear, as well as investing back into focus categories and what's working, because we like the ROI of those investments. Steve, do you want to take the second part?\nSteve Priest: Yeah, definitely. Hey, good afternoon, Colin. So in terms of the negative one organic FX and growth that we saw from a GMV standpoint, there's a number of macro impacts that we're looking at. So the first thing I'd say, in September we observed some softening in consumer demand, which has carried through to October, and that helped imply the guide that we went forward with. This has been most pronounced in Europe. A couple of our biggest markets, UK is the second largest market and has continued to experience negative e-commerce growth since early 2022. Germany, our third largest market has now faced multiple quarter of economic contraction. And the U.S., as I said, we're starting to see some softness and we would expect the holiday\u2019s period to be a little bit more muted. So when I look back on the third quarter and the dynamics that were at play, U.S. GMV declined 2% on an FX organic basis and international was roughly flat. The European softness has been helped by some of the CBT trade that we've seen that has been resilient. Think about consumers looking for value and the cross-border trade coming out of the Far East has been more resilient, and as a reminder for our investor community, the GMV is measured where the seller is domiciled. And so you've got softness in Europe, we're lapping through some of that dynamic, but the strength in CBT has sort of helped the international dynamic in Q3.\nColin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nRoss Sandler : Hey. Steve, just to follow-up on that macro comment. As you guys look across different discretionary categories and price points. Do you think it's just mostly like the macro conditions you described with the consumer weakening around GDP, etc. or are any of these new competitors like Temu and Shein having an impact at the low end as some of your peers have flagged? And then the second question is pleasantly surprised and happy to hear about the operating margin increase next year. So can you just flush that out a little bit for us, is that a function of lapping some of the international shipping investments and kind of discrete R&D investments? What other factors might drive that op margin increase next year? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Ross. I'll kick off the macro one and then Jamie can add, and then I'll cover the margin question. So from a macro basis, just to reiterate, we did see at a macro level, softening in September. Seeing that continue through October, we describe Europe as being softer from an overall perspective based on the macro data that we all see. The U.S., we have continued to see some softness across the board, and it's really a function of discretionary spend. As consumers sentiment is down, inflation is up and obviously the impacts of interest rates. Jamie, maybe Ross's question?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. No, I don't think it's in particular any specific other competitive thing. Like your question on Temu, we\u2019ve not seen a significant impact from Temu or Shein on our business. When we look at our cross-border trade as Steve talked about, it continues to remain healthy. We believe that's because of our differentiated strategy and our approach. If you remember, we've been talking about this for a while. We've been strategically moving away from low quality, low ASP items, and that hasn't been a focus for us for years. I think the other big difference for our platform, Ross, is that we\u2019re \u2013 a vast, vast majority of our traffic is organic. So I think as others are implicated by kind of the paid search or other marketing spend out there in the market, we're less so and more resilient, just because so much of our traffic is driven organically on the platform.\nSteve Priest: And then with regards to your question, Ross, on 24, obviously there'll be a number of puts and takes that will impact \u201824. We're in the middle of planning at the moment. The thing I would say is, we will continue to be very disciplined and get the balance right between growth and profitability. We've been making various investments over the last few years, which we will continue to leverage and scale as we get into sort of 2024. We are looking at every area of our cost structure. Obviously, in terms of external spending with suppliers, we've been very measured in terms of our approach to the structural cost program this year. With the influx of AI, that will really help us sort of lean in to support the operation next year and use the benefits of that as we go forward. And we can control our cost structure. I mean, we are operating in a rather dynamic macro environment and so we will lean in as we said, and make sure that our costs grow more slowly than revenue in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nNikhil Devnani : Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. I had a couple, please. Just following-up on that operating leverage theme, as you think about prioritizing kind of the highest ROI investments next year, what initiatives are really making that top of that list? And which ones are you maybe more willing to push out a little bit if times get tougher? And then on the focus categories, it's kind of nice to hear the market share stability. When you observe what's changed pre and post your improvements, is this a function of conversion rates functionally improving or are you also now able to kind of drive better traffic to those focus categories?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So first on the initiatives, we're still obviously in planning for next year. But I'd say a couple of things. As Steve talked about the cost structure, one of the things we're looking at is how do we leverage AI and technologies so that our costs don't grow as our volume grows? So I'll give you an example of, one of the areas we've been investing a lot in is our customer support. And so if you look at like our GCX expenses, our customer support expenses, we've been rolling out conversational help bots over the course of the last few quarters, really advancing what we're doing there so that we can, focus a lot of our efforts into handling more calls and greater volume with higher customer satisfaction. As an example, we just launched that as a trial in Germany. We've had that live in some of our English markets. An example of some of the initiatives that we're going to do next year to manage the business and make sure that as Steve said, we're going after the growth opportunities in the business, while being prudent about our expense structure. When you think about focus categories and what's driving the success there, I would say it's a couple of things. One is that, if I look at like for P&A, for example, this is our third quarter of seeing mid-single digit growth, which is in-line with markets. And we're just now launching Guaranteed Fit, which is one of the big value propositions for us in that category, to our markets, our second and third largest markets in UK and Germany, where we do have a leading marketing position from that standpoint. And what we're seeing is that, the new work that we've been doing in Fitment, for example, has really been helpful. I talked about 2 billion new Fitment combinations based on my Fitment, and then our sellers are seeing double digit increases in their conversion. So to your point I think, we're doing a better job with our full funnel marketing in each category, acquiring enthusiasts into those categories. And then when we bring them on, we're having a better experience for them in converting them into sales and converting them into repeat buyers, because of the changes we've made in trust, because of the changes we've made in the experience. I mean, think about like our luxury category. This is the third quarter where we're seeing positive growth in luxury, even in this market, and you're seeing kind of what's happening and what others are saying. And it's because of the customer value proposition that we're bringing to these categories that we're seeing those results. So we're going to continue to innovate and push forward on that strategy, because we like the results that we're seeing and the consumers responding. And then we're enhancing the focus category work with a lot of site-wide investments. And those site-wide investments not only help us in focus categories, but they help us in our other core categories in the business. So I'd use the example of magical listing. It certainly helps sell a sneaker faster or a training card or a watch or a handbag, but it also helps sell a musical instrument faster or a board game or a book or all the things that people sell on eBay, because we're taking so much time out of the listing process that we're looking to unlock more of what's in people's closets, garages and basements with this technology. And we think that those investments will help both focus categories and our other core categories on the business.\nNikhil Devnani : Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Champion from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nThomas Champion : Hi, good afternoon. Jamie or Steve, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about EIS and how that is performing relative to your expectations around transactions or inventory and how the cost drag is performing and whether you're making progress there. And then maybe Steve, specifically for you, notice the buyback uptick this quarter. Can you just walk us through the thought process behind that? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah, thanks, Thomas. So look, on EIS, we love the success we're seeing in the program. It's making cross-border trade much easier on the program. eBay handles everything for the seller, the customs, the duty forms with buyers. We intermediate the returns, and we protect sellers from item not received complaints. So we continue to ramp the program over time. Half of our big three inventory is not available to be shipped internationally, so we're excited about the goal of this program, which is basically make it super easy for sellers, so they don't have to think, and we handle all of that cross-border trade for them. We continue to scale it during Q3. We now have over 400 million live listings. We launched some new features with the program, for example, the ability to combine shipping. So for example, I was with a seller or a buyer, a collectible buyer in Japan of trading cards, whose buying trading cards out of the U.S. Now he can buy multiple trading cards. We can combine them in a single shipping invoice, just making the whole EIS program a lot better. The last thing I'd say is that, when I look at the program overall for sellers, it has a 30-point higher customer satisfaction than the previous program that we've had. So all of the work that we did to bring things in-house last year, Steve talked about the financial implications, we're seeing that in CSAT and sellers, and we're seeing them react in terms of what's available internationally. Steve, do you want to handle the second part?\nSteve Priest: Yeah, and just to say, Tom, with regard to EIS, we're really pleased with the momentum, largely in line with our expectations from a financial architecture standpoint. As we said, we expect this program to be committed to operating profit for this year, and by the year end, it will be in line with core margins on the platform. So, pleased with what we're seeing. Specifically, with regard to your question on capital returns, the duty of the eBay franchise, where we're generating just under $2 billion of free cash flow a year, gives us the ability to invest in the business, but continue to drive healthy returns to shareholders. We laid out a path to 125% of free cash flow to shareholders who stock buybacks and dividends, cumulatively between 2022 and 2024. Since the beginning of 2022, we've returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders, and we're roughly at 125%, so we're right on track with the commitments that we made.\nThomas Champion : Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks so much. Two, if I could. So, the macro environment is obviously a massive challenge for the business at the moment, but as we look out to next year, can you maybe help us better understand what leverage do you think you have at your disposal to perhaps get volumes back to even modest growth if the macro environment proves to be persistently weak in the medium term? And then, just to contextualize some of the comments around slower cost growth into next year relative to revenue, I think investors will be pleased to hear it, but is this a more cautious stance on investment impacting in any way the pace at which you think you can roll focus category coverage out over the next 12 to 24 months, or are those investments already fully baked and the pace shouldn't be impacted in any way? Thanks so much.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So, I would say a couple things. One is we're not going to get ahead of ourselves on 2024 and talk about that on this call. We've laid out the strategy that we have for expanding focus categories for the site-wide investments that we're making, and we feel really good about what we're driving and the underlying changes in the business. On the expenses side, I wouldn't think about it as pulling back in areas that we think will drive growth in the business, but more what I talked about earlier, which is finding opportunities to create leverage out of the model. When you think of things like cost of payments, when you think of things like how we're going to use AI to enable our \u2013 the efficiency of the organization, you know, the whole motto here is \u2018control what we can control.\u2019 And, that's why we think we've planned for the architecture that Steve laid out, and we're really not going to get ahead of ourselves on anything more from 2024. But our main goal, and we've been doing this through the structured cost program, is to drive efficiency in the organization without driving the key layers, the key levers and the innovations that have driven growth on the platform.\nLee Horowitz: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morton from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Morton: Thank you. I appreciate the question. If we could start maybe with authentication. For a few quarters now, you've highlighted as a headwind to gross margins, which makes sense. And I'd love to note, this is a line item that we should expect to see some leverage on as we go forward in the future. It's just tricky to think about as we're all like marketplace analysts, right, And there's really high income and margins. But when you're doing something like authenticating, like if you double the amount of shoes you're authenticating, like if people are touching boxes, its inventory. So any thoughts there on how we should think about that line item going forward in the next 12, 24 months? You don't need to get too detailed, but just the leverage aspect. And then just talking about the leverage that you saw in sales and marketing, I understand and appreciate that you have a lot of direct traffic, but so do some other marketplaces that have seen a lot of increased competition across social, in search. So just impressive to see that leverage and would love to \u2013 and I know you guys have invested in full funnel advertising over the last 12 months to really get your improved product out there. So just to help us understand how you're seeing that leverage when other marketplaces are having such a challenging environment would be great as well. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Michael, I'll pick up the first one. So we've been really pleased with the levels of trust that we are continuing to build on eBay, particularly focused around our focus categories. And so the first thing I would say is thinking about authentication as a trust metric that's really driving CSAT. And so it's a great return on investment, because it's not just about the category that one shops in, but also it's about the cross-category shopping that goes away from that. So every consumer that spends about $400 of sneakers on the average buyer spends $2,000 elsewhere on the platform. And it's really the fact they get attracted to it. So you should be thinking about this as an investment that we're making and the requisite return on investment. The second thing I would say is it's not just about authentication, because some people look into eBay and think it's all about authentication. Fitment is to P&A and warranties are to seller refurbished and certified refurbished, which authentication is to watches, sneakers and handbags. And so we're continuing to, (A) get scale as we're sort of driving this through the overall platform, but also we're getting the benefits of trust and the benefits of cross-category shopping as we go that forward. So it continues to be relatively de-minimis, but I would think of it as an overall return on investment. Jamie, do you want to pick up the question with regards to the traffic?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah, look, we've shifted our marketing strategy as we've talked about, and we're telling our story in new and different ways. Rather than focus on those large brand campaigns, we've been doing really targeted marketing spend to enthusiasts in our focus categories through this full funnel approach, using a real full funnel, mid, lower, upper. And all of that full funnel makes our lower funnel work harder. We've been doing partnerships with influencers, leveraging social media in better ways. And so the whole shift in our marketing strategy is not to just go after kind of active buyers and a big brand campaign, but really market the value proposition that we have on the platform with a really targeted approach to go after enthusiasts in that category. And that's why I think you're seeing the results that we've talked about in P&A, which is our third quarter of in-market lines of growth in the mid-single digits is because of the effect of the marketing programs.\nSteve Priest: The other thing I would add is just the size and scale of eBay and the general operation efficiencies we get with this. To Jamie\u2019s point on full funnel marketing, we get to a point where we've got paid, owned, and now earned marketing across the board, which really brings additional consumers to eBay and continues to drive that level of trust on the platform to ultimately drive the underlying GMV momentum.\nMichael Morton: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. Going back to the comments on the broader softening of the e-commerce environment, how does that typically show up in your model? When you think about what you've seen in the UK or Germany, is it slower buyer growth? Is it less velocity or repeat behavior on the shopping level, is it basket size? How should we be thinking about the signals you're watching for elements of the softening versus what might be a recovery as we move through Q4 and into next year? That would be number one. And then when you look about the seller services side of the equation, I know you've made a lot of progress on ads and payments and shipping. What do you think the biggest friction points still are to continue to solidify the seller services side of the equation for the marketplace, especially if the macro environment does become a little more uncertain and sellers are looking for assistance from marketplaces? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Hi. Good afternoon, Eric. I'll take the first one. It generally shows up in traffic, as you would imagine. When you think about eBay and consumers looking at discretionary spend and the wallets generally get a little pressured, that's really where it tends to show up. If I reflect on our business, and let's not forget, half of eBay's GMV is generated outside the US. And if you think about Europe, you think about the likes of the UK and Germany, our second and third largest markets. When you look at the data in terms of e-commerce, excluding grocery, UK was shrinking at three points in September and Germany was down minus seven. And so we're seeing quite a precipitous decline in some of that e-commerce growth out of those couple of key markets. And invariably, as those consumers continue to get pressured in their wallets, it has an ultimate impact on traffic and discretionary spend. Jamie, in terms of the other items?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah, on seller services, Eric, it's really been across the board. If you think about our B2C sellers, it's been a key focus for us for over three years now. We started with eBay stores and a lot of innovation that we did when I first got back to eBay. Since then, we've been building out the ad portfolio, as we've been talking about each quarter. We continue to enhance our shipping profile and our shipping services. So one example is like in our P&A category, we now have the ability for a B2C seller to say, I have multiple warehouses that I can ship out of, and we'll ship out of the one closest to the buyer to get it faster to the buyer. In our German business, we just launched a more expedited returns process, which helps sellers manage returns in easier ways. EIS is helping them get more global scale demand. Payments is giving them more payment choices. So, when you think about it, I was just with a seller in Australia who sells tires, and he's like, I love the integration that you guys did with Afterpay, because in this economy, a lot of people buying a new set of tires are using the buy now, pay later solutions. So I would say it's a combination of all of the things that we've done that are really being great services for B2C. At the same time, we've been investing a lot in the C2C experience with things like the magical listings, really letting them list with a whole lot more ease. As I've talked about last quarter, the customer satisfaction for a brand new product there is amongst the highest I've ever seen. And what casual sellers are telling us is this is going to allow them to unlock more inventory because of how easy we're making it. And that's now scaled out to 100% of our business across U.S., UK, and DE. So we continue to invest a lot in our sellers. We continue to grow the number of live listings on the platform, and we continue to raise the customer value proposition that we're giving them on eBay.\nJohn Egbert : Operator, can we do one last question, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Jamie, given that consumers are increasingly looking at deal shopping during this holiday season due to macro pressures and inflationary environment, some of the other e-commerce platforms like Etsy are kind of incentivizing sellers to step up discounts and are also doing promos on their own to drive volume. Is that something that eBay can do? Do your buyers react to this? And do you see opportunities to maybe mitigate some of these macro pressures with product initiatives if this kind of persists for a while next year? And then now maybe one quick one for Steve. Steve, can you help quantify the cash outflow due to the taxes in 4Q? Is that a constraint to kind of stay on your buyback cadence for 4Q or any additional color you can provide? That would be great. Thank you so much, guys.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah Deepak, the only real couponing and promotion stuff we do, we do it in conjunction with our sellers, where they are kind of funding those coupons. And that does work, and that's in partnership with our sellers. We sometimes also do that with our external promotional listings products that we've been talking about, one of our new ad products. But we really moved away from the couponing that was unhealthy that we did back in 2019. And we have no plans to reintroduce that type of couponing because it wasn't driving the type of ROI that we wanted. The bigger point for eBay overall has been the shift in strategy to focus on used, non-new in season and refurbished. Because when customers face these inflationary environments, they're continuing to look at eBay for better value. Our refurbished business is up double digits, because people are getting like-new products for 40% off. Our used business is growing faster than our new business, because of the demand that people see and the values that they can get on eBay. So we just did a survey, and we found that 90% of consumers that responded to the survey said that they purchased pre-loved goods on eBay in the past year. So our play on value is really the new strategy of what we're going after of driving those businesses, and that's what's resonating with our customers. Steve, do you want to talk about the cash implications of taxes?\nSteve Priest: Yeah, obviously we talked about the free cash flow dynamics and the timing of the cash payments of \u201823 impacted by the California State Disaster Tax Relief, which has shifted our cash tax payments to October versus that\u2019s being paid during Q2, Q3, and that's really the reference point we were talking about. We don't get into sort of forecasting buybacks on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Really pleased with the continued momentum we've got on that at around 125%, and that's really an average over the cycle that we talked about. But we're bang on track and happy with where we are.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the third quarter on slide 11 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic, effect-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. Q3 was another solid quarter for eBay as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to approximately $18 billion. Revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion, outpacing volume by five points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we generated $777 million of free cash flow, while returning $783 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% organically to approximately $18 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year on a total FX neutral basis. Foreign exchange represented a nearly two-point tailwind to reported GMV growth. However, the U.S. dollar appreciation during the quarter created a GMV headwind of more than $100 million versus rates implied in our Q3 outlook. Focus categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace. P&A was once again the largest contributor to growth and maintained mid-single-digit GMV growth for the third straight quarter, in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished was the fastest-growing focus category on a percentage basis, while GMV growth in our Luxury focus categories was positive for the third straight quarter, as our combination of value and quality has served customers well in the current economic environment. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 2% organically in Q3, an improvement of over two points sequentially. On a total FX neutral basis, U.S. GMV was down 1%. Although the U.S. economy has been more resilient than our other markets, demand for discretionary goods continues to be impacted by the cumulative burden of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates observed in over a decade. U.S. consumers are increasingly seeking value, which has shifted some demand to inventory offered by our CBT sellers. International GMV was roughly flat on an FX neutral basis, and at nearly 4% as reported. Our international markets continue to experience more severe macroeconomic pressure than the U.S., with the UK seeing consistently negative e-commerce growth since early 2022, while Germany has now faced multiple quarters of economic contraction. This pressure has been mitigated by continued strength in cross-border trade, which offset far weaker trends in Europe. Moving to buyers, trading 12-month active buyers was stable quarter-over-quarter at $132 million. On an organic basis, active buyers remained at approximately $131 million for the third straight quarter. Enthusiast buyers were also flat sequentially at $16 million. Spend per enthusiast was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually, but modestly year-over-year. Turning to revenue, we generated revenue of $2.5 billion during the third quarter, at 4% organically, outpacing volume by five points. Total FX neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A was 5%, while currency had a de-minimis impact to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9%, down modestly quarter-over-quarter, but up nearly 50 basis points year-over-year. The combination of FX and the ads revenue recognition change in Q2 represented a sequential take rate headwind of over 10 basis points in Q3. Advertising was again the largest tailwind to our take rate on a year-over-year basis, and also quarter-over-quarter after adjusting for the Q2 accounting change. eBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate added five basis points to our take rate sequentially. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million and reached just over 2% penetration of GMV. First party ads grew 36% to $345 million or roughly 36 points faster than FX mutual volume. As noted last quarter, the revenue deferral release for CPC ads in Q2 created a sequential headwind of $9 million to first party ad revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased with the continued robust growth in promoted listings, year-over-year growth decelerated slightly as we lacked a notable acceleration during the prior year period, which was driven by a series of performance optimizations. Our legacy third party display ads, which have been impacted by a combination of secular and macro headwinds in recent quarters, decelerated further during Q3. In recent months, we have actively deprecated third party ads in certain circumstances to improve the user experience. Third party ads remain our primary focus as we continue to invest in scaling, optimizing and automating our promoted listings portfolio. Financial services had a modestly positive impact on our take rate sequentially. As our in-house payments capabilities have advanced in recent quarters, we have identified more opportunities for GMV, revenue and cost optimization. Adyen continues to be an incredibly strategic partner for us in financial services. During Q3, we expanded our usage of Adyen's Merchant Acquiring Services to cover additional forms of payments. This development has positive implications for our Adyen Warrant probability, which I will discuss shortly. Moving to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4% during the quarter, down roughly 2.5 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.1 points of this delta was driven by the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping Program. Foreign Exchange also represents the year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points. The remainder of the margin variance was driven by investments in our business and modest volume de-leverage. Gross margin was down nearly 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily from the ramp of eBay International Shipping. Within our operating expenses, we observed a 1 point increase in product development expense as we invested in product and engineering talent to drive innovation across eBay. Sales and marketing was down modestly as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3, as our investments in full-frontal marketing initiatives were offset by cost efficiencies, including lower spend on coupons and incentives. During the quarter, we also accrued an additional $50 million to G&A expense on a GAAP basis related to pending legal matters. This adjustment is reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliation, while additional details on the accrual will be provided in our 10-Q filing. We continue to focus on driving expenses out of the business, which is a crucial part of our path to long-term sustainable growth. And where we do choose to invest, we are able to partially offset that with OpEx savings given by our structural cost program. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation, we generated free cash flow of $777 million in Q3, up 23%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.4 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased over $650 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3, and had $1.7 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization at the quarter end. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends or roughly 125% of cumulative free cash flow over that period. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, benefiting from a nearly 4% reduction in share count from our repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $2.46, with a delta driven by unrealized gains on our equity investment portfolio, primarily from Adevinta. Our investment portfolio is detailed on slide 21 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued over $4.5 billion at the end of Q3. Our $404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $4 billion, at more than $1 billion versus the prior quarter. As we disclosed in late September, we have expressed support for the proposal made by the Consortium of Investors to Adevinta, under which we would retain a portion of our current holdings. As these discussions are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide any further comments on this transaction or the implications of such a transaction to eBay today. Our Adyen [ph] warrants were valued at nearly $200 million at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, our warrant value was calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of our remaining warrant tranches vesting. During Q3, the probability of vesting was positively impacted by an evolution in our usage of Adyen's products and services. The three remaining warrant tranches now carry probabilities ranging between 0% and 95%. However, the increasing probability was more than offset by a price decline in Adyen shares during the third quarter. Moving on to our outlook, although our third quarter volume trends were slightly better than expected, we did observe softening consumer demand in September that carried through October. This macro softness was most pronounced in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany, our second and third largest markets, respectively. We have also seen tapering demand in the U.S. market quarter to-date. Given these trends, our base case expectation is that continued pressure on discretionary demand will lead to a relatively muted seasonal uptick in volumes during the holiday season. For the fourth quarter, we expect to generate between $17.9 and $18.3 billion of GMV, representing an organic FX neutral decline of between 4% and 2% year-over-year, or spot growth between negative 2% and flat. The strengthening U.S. dollar also creates an incremental FX headwind to fourth quarter GMV of roughly $400 million versus our prior guidance on a spot basis. This is on top of more than $100 million FX headwind to Q3 GMV. On a sequential basis, we estimate FX will represent over a one-point headwind to GMV growth and nearly one point of pressure to revenue growth. We anticipate Q4 revenue between $2.47 and $2.53 billion represents organic FX neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 2% year-over-year. This implies revenue will outpace volume by three to four points on an organic FX neutral basis in Q4. As a reminder, our core take rate is typically down sequentially by 10 to 15 basis points in Q4 due to seasonal ASP and category mix, although this trend has occasionally been masked by payments and ads growth in the recent past. Given our tempered outlook for Q4 volume and continued uncertainty in the global economy, we believe it is prudent to lean in more heavily into cost efficiencies to protect margins and earnings in this environment. We forecast non-GAAP operating margins between 26.1% and 26.7% during Q4, which would yield margins near the high end of our prior guidance range for the full year. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.05, representing EPS growth between negative 6% and negative 2% year-over-year. At current rate, FX would represent a four-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q4, as we lack meaningful hedging gains in the prior year period. Our outlook for free cash flow of just under $2 billion this year remains unchanged. As I noted last quarter, we expect the minimum free cash flow in Q4 due to the delayed timing of cash tax payments in 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are expected between 4% and 5%, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. In relation to 2024, it is premature to offer specific commentary as we are in the midst of our planning process. We remain committed to finding an appropriate balance between growth and profitability to ensure we are positioned for durable financial returns in the years ahead. As such, we plan to grow expenses more slowly than revenue next year as we scale and leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. We will remain good stewards of capital as we continue to target returning 125% of cumulative free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases and dividends through 2024. We will target a certain level of capital returns from quarter-to-quarter, while maintaining the flexibility to lean in opportunistically when appropriate. In closing, our Q3 results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid continued challenges in the global economy. Our fortress balance sheet and operational discipline have enabled us to adapt to rapidly evolving demand environments, while continuing to invest for the future, protecting earnings and delivering meaningful capital returns to shareholders. I'm extremely proud of our team, for staying focused on our strategic pillars amid this uncertainty and further laying the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yeah, definitely. Hey, good afternoon, Colin. So in terms of the negative one organic FX and growth that we saw from a GMV standpoint, there's a number of macro impacts that we're looking at. So the first thing I'd say, in September we observed some softening in consumer demand, which has carried through to October, and that helped imply the guide that we went forward with. This has been most pronounced in Europe. A couple of our biggest markets, UK is the second largest market and has continued to experience negative e-commerce growth since early 2022. Germany, our third largest market has now faced multiple quarter of economic contraction. And the U.S., as I said, we're starting to see some softness and we would expect the holiday's period to be a little bit more muted. So when I look back on the third quarter and the dynamics that were at play, U.S. GMV declined 2% on an FX organic basis and international was roughly flat. The European softness has been helped by some of the CBT trade that we've seen that has been resilient. Think about consumers looking for value and the cross-border trade coming out of the Far East has been more resilient, and as a reminder for our investor community, the GMV is measured where the seller is domiciled. And so you've got softness in Europe, we're lapping through some of that dynamic, but the strength in CBT has sort of helped the international dynamic in Q3. Thanks, Ross. I'll kick off the macro one and then Jamie can add, and then I'll cover the margin question. So from a macro basis, just to reiterate, we did see at a macro level, softening in September. Seeing that continue through October, we describe Europe as being softer from an overall perspective based on the macro data that we all see. The U.S., we have continued to see some softness across the board, and it's really a function of discretionary spend. As consumers sentiment is down, inflation is up and obviously the impacts of interest rates. Jamie, maybe Ross's question? And then with regards to your question, Ross, on 24, obviously there'll be a number of puts and takes that will impact \u201824. We're in the middle of planning at the moment. The thing I would say is, we will continue to be very disciplined and get the balance right between growth and profitability. We've been making various investments over the last few years, which we will continue to leverage and scale as we get into sort of 2024. We are looking at every area of our cost structure. Obviously, in terms of external spending with suppliers, we've been very measured in terms of our approach to the structural cost program this year. With the influx of AI, that will really help us sort of lean in to support the operation next year and use the benefits of that as we go forward. And we can control our cost structure. I mean, we are operating in a rather dynamic macro environment and so we will lean in as we said, and make sure that our costs grow more slowly than revenue in 2024. Yeah, and just to say, Tom, with regard to EIS, we're really pleased with the momentum, largely in line with our expectations from a financial architecture standpoint. As we said, we expect this program to be committed to operating profit for this year, and by the year end, it will be in line with core margins on the platform. So, pleased with what we're seeing. Specifically, with regard to your question on capital returns, the duty of the eBay franchise, where we're generating just under $2 billion of free cash flow a year, gives us the ability to invest in the business, but continue to drive healthy returns to shareholders. We laid out a path to 125% of free cash flow to shareholders who stock buybacks and dividends, cumulatively between 2022 and 2024. Since the beginning of 2022, we've returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders, and we're roughly at 125%, so we're right on track with the commitments that we made. Hi, Michael, I'll pick up the first one. So we've been really pleased with the levels of trust that we are continuing to build on eBay, particularly focused around our focus categories. And so the first thing I would say is thinking about authentication as a trust metric that's really driving CSAT. And so it's a great return on investment, because it's not just about the category that one shops in, but also it's about the cross-category shopping that goes away from that. So every consumer that spends about $400 of sneakers on the average buyer spends $2,000 elsewhere on the platform. And it's really the fact they get attracted to it. So you should be thinking about this as an investment that we're making and the requisite return on investment. The second thing I would say is it's not just about authentication, because some people look into eBay and think it's all about authentication. Fitment is to P&A and warranties are to seller refurbished and certified refurbished, which authentication is to watches, sneakers and handbags. And so we're continuing to, (A) get scale as we're sort of driving this through the overall platform, but also we're getting the benefits of trust and the benefits of cross-category shopping as we go that forward. So it continues to be relatively de-minimis, but I would think of it as an overall return on investment. Jamie, do you want to pick up the question with regards to the traffic? The other thing I would add is just the size and scale of eBay and the general operation efficiencies we get with this. To Jamie's point on full funnel marketing, we get to a point where we've got paid, owned, and now earned marketing across the board, which really brings additional consumers to eBay and continues to drive that level of trust on the platform to ultimately drive the underlying GMV momentum. Hi. Good afternoon, Eric. I'll take the first one. It generally shows up in traffic, as you would imagine. When you think about eBay and consumers looking at discretionary spend and the wallets generally get a little pressured, that's really where it tends to show up. If I reflect on our business, and let's not forget, half of eBay's GMV is generated outside the US. And if you think about Europe, you think about the likes of the UK and Germany, our second and third largest markets. When you look at the data in terms of e-commerce, excluding grocery, UK was shrinking at three points in September and Germany was down minus seven. And so we're seeing quite a precipitous decline in some of that e-commerce growth out of those couple of key markets. And invariably, as those consumers continue to get pressured in their wallets, it has an ultimate impact on traffic and discretionary spend. Jamie, in terms of the other items? Yeah, obviously we talked about the free cash flow dynamics and the timing of the cash payments of \u201823 impacted by the California State Disaster Tax Relief, which has shifted our cash tax payments to October versus that's being paid during Q2, Q3, and that's really the reference point we were talking about. We don't get into sort of forecasting buybacks on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Really pleased with the continued momentum we've got on that at around 125%, and that's really an average over the cycle that we talked about. But we're bang on track and happy with where we are."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid results during the third quarter. We generated gross merchandise volume of approximately $18 billion, while revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 3%, while returning over $780 million of capital to shareholders. We achieved these results despite continued challenges in the global macro environment. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and pressured demand for discretionary goods. As Steve will discuss in greater detail, we've observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4, and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays. We are focused on controlling what we can control, being prudent about our costs, leaning into operational efficiencies, and continuing to drive innovation for our customers. Last quarter, I discussed our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts, which is focused on three strategic pillars; Relevant Experiences, Scalable Solutions, and Magical Innovation. And I'm pleased that we made meaningful progress against each of these pillars during Q3, which I'll discuss in greater detail. I'll start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. Our relevance in focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business, and we've observed a meaningful improvement in our growth relative to the market in every category we've invested to date. Focus categories grew roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace in Q3. Year-to-date, our focus categories have grown at approximately 4% year-over-year. For context, we estimate market rates of growth in those same categories were in the low single digits on average during the first half of 2023, as several of these categories are comprised of highly discretionary goods, which have been more acutely impacted by the challenging macro environment. We continue to push the envelope of innovation in motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, by developing features that enhance our customer value proposition. These investments have fueled mid-single digit GMV growth for P&A for three consecutive quarters, which is in line with industry growth for this segment of e-commerce in our largest markets. The eBay Guaranteed Fit program has contributed to this momentum by delivering a game changing level of trust. This program enables tens of millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence, knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back, which has yielded a measurable uplift in conversion. Additionally, we have not observed a material impact on product returns, as our fitment checks have reduced the likelihood of buyers receiving a part that does not fit their vehicle. Given the success this program has had in the U.S., we were incredibly excited to roll out similar programs in the UK and Germany during Q3, where our unaided awareness among P&A shoppers is significantly higher than it is in the U.S. The Guaranteed Fit program is underpinned by multiple years of investment in P&A technology, including our acquisition of myFitment. We have been steadily onboarding sellers into the myFitment toolkit, to enhance their P&A listings with more robust fitment data, which improves findability for parts and protects buyers from unnecessary returns. By the end of Q3, roughly two-thirds of large U.S. P&A sellers have adopted the toolkit. On average, sellers are observing conversion uplift of double digits or higher for listings enhanced by this toolkit, driving incremental GMV for eBay. In early October, we reached a major milestone with 2 billion pieces of fitment data added to live listings using myFitment's technology. While this is outstanding progress, we continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding process, making it faster to import listings, and identifying more vehicle matches for our more than 550 million live P&A listings. During Q3, we continued to deliver relevant experiences for the collectibles category across a number of areas. We generated over $10 billion in GMV from collectibles over the last 12 months, and more than one in four eBay buyers purchased at least one collectibles item over the past year. These buyers carry some of the highest conversion, repurchase, and retention rates on eBay. And they are also among the heaviest cross-category shoppers on our platform, which supports our other categories. Our goal is to remain the world's most loved destination for passionate collectibles enthusiasts, providing access to the most compelling assortment of inventory across multiple categories in a high-trust environment. In service of that vision, during Q3 we launched direct submissions to the eBay vault. This enables any U.S. resident to send in trading cards valued at $250 or higher from their personal collections to the vault, even if they were not purchased on eBay. In July, to coincide with the National Sports Collectors Convention, the industry's biggest event, we announced Vault Enhanced Submission, which now enables us to gather large amounts of high ASP cards in person at tent pole events attended by top collectors. During one weekend at the National Loan [ph], we added tens of millions of dollars of assets under management to the eBay vault, including a signed Jackie Robinson card valued at approximately $1 million. During Q3, we also wrote out a revamped condition grading system for trading cards, which greatly improves transparency for collectibles in this category. New listings now carry more precise details, including whether a card has been professionally graded and the numerical grade, or one of several predefined card conditions. Existing listings will be also migrated to the new standard over the coming months. Sellers have been asking us for this feature for some time, and we believe it will drive improved trust for buyers, better and more consistent price realization for sellers, as well as more robust data and insights around individual card values for eBay. In response to our growing community of collectors and enthusiasts, last year we introduced eBay Live, an interactive live shopping experience within the eBay app. This feature marries eBay's unique scale with an engaging shopping experience that we believe enthusiasts across the collectibles, luxury and fashion categories are increasingly seeking. Buyers can interact with influential sellers and check out in real time without leaving the stream. And sellers have loved this tool as they can move items at scale and increase their sales velocity, while listing items as fixed price or as extended auctions. eBay Live is currently in beta, but we continue to expand its availability to more sellers and categories. While we've been thoughtful about the pace of onboarding as we fine-tune the beta experience, Q3 marked an inflection point as we hosted over 1,000 live events, saw our millionth buyer tune in, and grew GMV from eBay Live by 4x quarter-over-quarter. Now, let me turn to the second pillar of our evolve strategy, Scalable Solutions. We're pleased with the progress we're making with our eBay International Shipping Program or EIS, which makes cross-border trade more seamless and cost-effective for sellers and buyers. We continue to scale EIS during Q3 and now have over 400 million live listings from U.S. sellers shippable to international buyers in more than 190 countries. Sellers have had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the new program, with customer satisfaction rates approximately 30 points higher than the previous global shipping program it replaced. In October, we launched Combined Shipping for EIS, which allows buyers to order multiple items from an international seller and pay one consolidated shipping fee. Q3 also marked another strong quarter for our advertising business. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million. First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or 36 points faster than FX-neutral GMV growth. Over 2.3 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q3, and we currently have over 850 million live promoted listings. Promoted Listing Standard, our cost per acquisition ad unit, was once again the largest contributor to growth in Q3, driven by continued optimization of placements, ad rate improvements, and the recurring benefit of the halo attribution change we discussed last quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click product, was the fastest growing product in our ads portfolio on a year-over-year basis. PL Advanced continues to benefit from the simplifying and automating of core elements of the campaign setup and management processes. In September, we launched Smart Targeting for PL Advanced, which makes creating and managing CPC campaigns easier than ever. Previously, these campaigns took a lot of time to set up and manage, as sellers had to manually select keywords and manage campaigns individually. Now, through Smart Targeting, eBay uses AI to manage keywords on behalf of sellers and optimize campaigns dynamically, all with just a few clicks to set up. As part of the Smart Targeting launch, we've also extended CPC ads to the Similar Items Recommendations module when users are viewing another item, using fully automated targeting and bidding technology. Moving to our third pillar, Magical Innovations. Last quarter, we discussed our Magical Listing experience, which represents the biggest transformation of the eBay listing process in our 28-year history. For over two decades, two of our biggest focuses were at odds with each other, making it as simple and fast as possible to list an item and ensuring listings are rich and comprehensive to maximize sales. Now Generative AI allows us to leverage our treasure trove of images and listing data to quickly create compelling listings. Early users have told us these capabilities will unlock more of the inventory in their closets and garages, which could ultimately keep more products out of landfills. The first phase of our magical listing experience leverages Generative AI to instantly populate the item description within the listing flow based on a product's title, category and other aspects. This feature rolled out to 100% of mobile app users in the U.S., UK, and Germany during Q3. In October, we extended the Generative AI descriptions to 50% of desktop users in these countries. The first phase of the magical listing experience has been incredibly well received by sellers as usage, adoption, customer satisfaction, and content acceptance rates have all been higher than expected. As much as sellers have enjoyed the first phase of Magical Listing, we believe the next iteration will be so simple and easy to use that all of our sellers will love it. This experience will enable sellers to point their camera at an item, take a photo, and eBay does the rest. Behind the scenes, we have powered this experience with our proprietary computer vision technology and Generative AI to seamlessly populate the description, category, and any other item aspects. Our camera-based magical listing experience has been in employee beta for several months and is currently in a limited beta with a number of large sellers. Feedback from our beta sellers has been extremely positive, as they found the new experience intuitive and easier to use. We are incredibly excited to bring this experience to more sellers over the coming months. As part of our magical listing initiative, we also rolled out a vastly improved background removal tool powered by AI during Q3. Sellers have told us that simpler, cleaner images of their products have a significant impact on conversion. Our enhanced tool has now rolled out to all users in the core listing flow, and sellers have told us they are already noticing significant quality and performance improvements from the revamped tool versus our prior version. Overall, I'm incredibly pleased by the progress we are making across all three pillars of our strategy. It is particularly encouraging to see how recent advancements in AI and machine learning can help us address more long-standing pain points for sellers and buyers on eBay in efficient and scalable ways. Next, I'd like to highlight the impact we're having on the communities we serve. In Q3 we released our Second Annual Small Business Report, which examines the sentiment of our global sellers. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, eBay sellers are confident they can build their businesses and give back to their communities. In fact, more than half of eBay sellers expect their overall business to grow in the next 12 months, and over two-thirds expect their businesses on eBay to increase over the next five years. We also recently announced the winners of our Up & Running Grants. This program is currently in its fourth year and provides entrepreneurs with capital to invest in their businesses, along with training and mentorship to help them grow and thrive. The third quarter also marked the 20th anniversary of eBay for Charity, a program created as a way for people to give back during times of crisis. It has evolved to a global platform supporting countless organizations and causes, and raised more than $1.3 billion for nonprofits to date. In Q3 alone, the eBay community raised $40 million, up 16% year-over-year. All of these efforts demonstrate our purpose-driven community, and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. We're proud to be ranked on the U.S. News & World Report's inaugural list of best companies to work for. eBay was also recognized as a top corporate philanthropist by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and San Francisco Business Times. In closing, I'd like to thank our extraordinary eBay team for delivering another solid quarter and continuing to innovate for our customers. We made significant progress against our long-term objectives during Q3. Our accelerating pace of innovation is fundamentally changing the eBay experience, driving higher customer satisfaction, and paving the way for new growth and revenue opportunities. As the macro environment remains uncertain, we'll be balanced in how we invest in the future, prioritizing our highest ROI investments in order to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yeah Colin, thanks for the question. So as you know with focus categories, we don't pre-announce the next categories that we're going into for competitive reasons, etcetera. We do continue to roll out new areas, as well as invest back into areas of the business. So, have a look at this quarter. We launched UK authentication for jewelry in our UK business. We're actually opening up an authentication center in Japan to allow for cross-border trade out of Japan, which is great. We launched or expanded in P&A, our guaranteed fit program. So that had launched just in the U.S. We've seen great results by creating a game-changing level of trust in that category, and we've expanded that now to UK and Germany this quarter and we're excited to see the impact of that on those markets. Our other categories like refurbished continue to do well. We've seen double-digit growth from that perspective. We launched some new enhancements in trading cards this quarter with the new classification system that we've put in place and new direct submission in the Vault. So we're going to continue to balance new focus category opportunities, expansion to other categories like we did with jewelry in the UK, and like we did recently with Streetwear, as well as investing back into focus categories and what's working, because we like the ROI of those investments. Steve, do you want to take the second part? Yeah. No, I don't think it's in particular any specific other competitive thing. Like your question on Temu, we've not seen a significant impact from Temu or Shein on our business. When we look at our cross-border trade as Steve talked about, it continues to remain healthy. We believe that's because of our differentiated strategy and our approach. If you remember, we've been talking about this for a while. We've been strategically moving away from low quality, low ASP items, and that hasn't been a focus for us for years. I think the other big difference for our platform, Ross, is that we're \u2013 a vast, vast majority of our traffic is organic. So I think as others are implicated by kind of the paid search or other marketing spend out there in the market, we're less so and more resilient, just because so much of our traffic is driven organically on the platform. Yeah. So first on the initiatives, we're still obviously in planning for next year. But I'd say a couple of things. As Steve talked about the cost structure, one of the things we're looking at is how do we leverage AI and technologies so that our costs don't grow as our volume grows? So I'll give you an example of, one of the areas we've been investing a lot in is our customer support. And so if you look at like our GCX expenses, our customer support expenses, we've been rolling out conversational help bots over the course of the last few quarters, really advancing what we're doing there so that we can, focus a lot of our efforts into handling more calls and greater volume with higher customer satisfaction. As an example, we just launched that as a trial in Germany. We've had that live in some of our English markets. An example of some of the initiatives that we're going to do next year to manage the business and make sure that as Steve said, we're going after the growth opportunities in the business, while being prudent about our expense structure. When you think about focus categories and what's driving the success there, I would say it's a couple of things. One is that, if I look at like for P&A, for example, this is our third quarter of seeing mid-single digit growth, which is in-line with markets. And we're just now launching Guaranteed Fit, which is one of the big value propositions for us in that category, to our markets, our second and third largest markets in UK and Germany, where we do have a leading marketing position from that standpoint. And what we're seeing is that, the new work that we've been doing in Fitment, for example, has really been helpful. I talked about 2 billion new Fitment combinations based on my Fitment, and then our sellers are seeing double digit increases in their conversion. So to your point I think, we're doing a better job with our full funnel marketing in each category, acquiring enthusiasts into those categories. And then when we bring them on, we're having a better experience for them in converting them into sales and converting them into repeat buyers, because of the changes we've made in trust, because of the changes we've made in the experience. I mean, think about like our luxury category. This is the third quarter where we're seeing positive growth in luxury, even in this market, and you're seeing kind of what's happening and what others are saying. And it's because of the customer value proposition that we're bringing to these categories that we're seeing those results. So we're going to continue to innovate and push forward on that strategy, because we like the results that we're seeing and the consumers responding. And then we're enhancing the focus category work with a lot of site-wide investments. And those site-wide investments not only help us in focus categories, but they help us in our other core categories in the business. So I'd use the example of magical listing. It certainly helps sell a sneaker faster or a training card or a watch or a handbag, but it also helps sell a musical instrument faster or a board game or a book or all the things that people sell on eBay, because we're taking so much time out of the listing process that we're looking to unlock more of what's in people's closets, garages and basements with this technology. And we think that those investments will help both focus categories and our other core categories on the business. Yeah, thanks, Thomas. So look, on EIS, we love the success we're seeing in the program. It's making cross-border trade much easier on the program. eBay handles everything for the seller, the customs, the duty forms with buyers. We intermediate the returns, and we protect sellers from item not received complaints. So we continue to ramp the program over time. Half of our big three inventory is not available to be shipped internationally, so we're excited about the goal of this program, which is basically make it super easy for sellers, so they don't have to think, and we handle all of that cross-border trade for them. We continue to scale it during Q3. We now have over 400 million live listings. We launched some new features with the program, for example, the ability to combine shipping. So for example, I was with a seller or a buyer, a collectible buyer in Japan of trading cards, whose buying trading cards out of the U.S. Now he can buy multiple trading cards. We can combine them in a single shipping invoice, just making the whole EIS program a lot better. The last thing I'd say is that, when I look at the program overall for sellers, it has a 30-point higher customer satisfaction than the previous program that we've had. So all of the work that we did to bring things in-house last year, Steve talked about the financial implications, we're seeing that in CSAT and sellers, and we're seeing them react in terms of what's available internationally. Steve, do you want to handle the second part? Yeah. So, I would say a couple things. One is we're not going to get ahead of ourselves on 2024 and talk about that on this call. We've laid out the strategy that we have for expanding focus categories for the site-wide investments that we're making, and we feel really good about what we're driving and the underlying changes in the business. On the expenses side, I wouldn't think about it as pulling back in areas that we think will drive growth in the business, but more what I talked about earlier, which is finding opportunities to create leverage out of the model. When you think of things like cost of payments, when you think of things like how we're going to use AI to enable our \u2013 the efficiency of the organization, you know, the whole motto here is \u2018control what we can control.' And, that's why we think we've planned for the architecture that Steve laid out, and we're really not going to get ahead of ourselves on anything more from 2024. But our main goal, and we've been doing this through the structured cost program, is to drive efficiency in the organization without driving the key layers, the key levers and the innovations that have driven growth on the platform. Yeah, look, we've shifted our marketing strategy as we've talked about, and we're telling our story in new and different ways. Rather than focus on those large brand campaigns, we've been doing really targeted marketing spend to enthusiasts in our focus categories through this full funnel approach, using a real full funnel, mid, lower, upper. And all of that full funnel makes our lower funnel work harder. We've been doing partnerships with influencers, leveraging social media in better ways. And so the whole shift in our marketing strategy is not to just go after kind of active buyers and a big brand campaign, but really market the value proposition that we have on the platform with a really targeted approach to go after enthusiasts in that category. And that's why I think you're seeing the results that we've talked about in P&A, which is our third quarter of in-market lines of growth in the mid-single digits is because of the effect of the marketing programs. Yeah, on seller services, Eric, it's really been across the board. If you think about our B2C sellers, it's been a key focus for us for over three years now. We started with eBay stores and a lot of innovation that we did when I first got back to eBay. Since then, we've been building out the ad portfolio, as we've been talking about each quarter. We continue to enhance our shipping profile and our shipping services. So one example is like in our P&A category, we now have the ability for a B2C seller to say, I have multiple warehouses that I can ship out of, and we'll ship out of the one closest to the buyer to get it faster to the buyer. In our German business, we just launched a more expedited returns process, which helps sellers manage returns in easier ways. EIS is helping them get more global scale demand. Payments is giving them more payment choices. So, when you think about it, I was just with a seller in Australia who sells tires, and he's like, I love the integration that you guys did with Afterpay, because in this economy, a lot of people buying a new set of tires are using the buy now, pay later solutions. So I would say it's a combination of all of the things that we've done that are really being great services for B2C. At the same time, we've been investing a lot in the C2C experience with things like the magical listings, really letting them list with a whole lot more ease. As I've talked about last quarter, the customer satisfaction for a brand new product there is amongst the highest I've ever seen. And what casual sellers are telling us is this is going to allow them to unlock more inventory because of how easy we're making it. And that's now scaled out to 100% of our business across U.S., UK, and DE. So we continue to invest a lot in our sellers. We continue to grow the number of live listings on the platform, and we continue to raise the customer value proposition that we're giving them on eBay. Yeah Deepak, the only real couponing and promotion stuff we do, we do it in conjunction with our sellers, where they are kind of funding those coupons. And that does work, and that's in partnership with our sellers. We sometimes also do that with our external promotional listings products that we've been talking about, one of our new ad products. But we really moved away from the couponing that was unhealthy that we did back in 2019. And we have no plans to reintroduce that type of couponing because it wasn't driving the type of ROI that we wanted. The bigger point for eBay overall has been the shift in strategy to focus on used, non-new in season and refurbished. Because when customers face these inflationary environments, they're continuing to look at eBay for better value. Our refurbished business is up double digits, because people are getting like-new products for 40% off. Our used business is growing faster than our new business, because of the demand that people see and the values that they can get on eBay. So we just did a survey, and we found that 90% of consumers that responded to the survey said that they purchased pre-loved goods on eBay in the past year. So our play on value is really the new strategy of what we're going after of driving those businesses, and that's what's resonating with our customers. Steve, do you want to talk about the cash implications of taxes?"

We delivered another solid quarter in Q2, exceeding expectations across all key metrics while investing in a disciplined manner to support our long-term objectives.  Before I jump into the details around our second quarter results, I'd like to discuss the evolution of our strategy. Three years ago, I articulated our ambition of becoming the best global marketplace to buy and sell through a tech-led re-imagination of eBay. This would help us realize the enormous untapped potential of this company and put it firmly on a path to sustainable long-term growth.  Since then, we've renewed our focus on products where we are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful choices and value for our customers. We've accelerated innovation to adapt to the changing needs of buyers and developed world-class shopping experiences in our focus categories. And we've changed our marketing strategy to support these experiences, pivoting to a full funnel approach aimed at attracting and retaining enthusiast buyers. These accomplishments make it a logical time to embark on the next phase of our journey.  The foundational work of our tech-led re-imagination will continue, including our prioritization of non-new products, expansion of focus categories in ads and payments initiatives. And now we're raising the bar for innovation and have set our sights on an even more ambitious vision which is reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay.  We will achieve this vision in the coming years by focusing on 3 key pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. Let's start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. This means we are solving the specific and ever-changing needs of our customers across all shopping occasions.  Through our focus category strategy, we've proven that when we build relevant experiences, we can dramatically improve customer satisfaction which translates into faster GMV growth. While we'll continue to understand customer needs and innovate at the category level, we will leverage the new tools, capabilities and technologies we have developed over the last few years to enhance more elements of the site-wide experience.  This includes developing a more relevant, consistent experience for the next generation of online shoppers through a comprehensive overhaul of our user experience and design rolled out in phases over the course of 2023 and beyond. This evolution will result in simpler, more personalized browsing experiences that will inspire people to sell, shop and connect with their community on eBay.  This initiative is a cross-collaborative effort between design, product, core AI, search, engineering and other key stakeholders to ensure our modernized shopping experience is powered by intelligent computing at scale. Enabled by artificial intelligence, we will fine-tune the breadth of inventory and other aspects of the shopping journey to cater to the varying needs of new buyers, infrequent shoppers and eBay enthusiasts.  We believe these innovations will increase our ability to bend cohort curves, drive higher lifetime values and ultimately grow enthusiasts and average spend per buyer.  We began rolling out these changes to consumers in recent months, starting with testing a more modern and intuitive view item page, which is the most visited page on eBay.  The updated page offers a streamlined appearance, larger and higher resolution images and an optimized information hierarchy. Early tests indicate a measurable uplift in GMV versus our existing design.  Over the next few quarters, you will see a continued evolution of the look, feel and experience of our marketplace, including updates to view item, our header, homepage, search results and other landing pages.  Alongside this work, we're investing in new capabilities for search, where relevance is also critical. We're investing in technologies like deep learning and visual similarity to improve ranking and retrieval, reducing queries with low or no results to see if there's more of our amazing inventory for customers.  Now let's turn to our second pillar, scalable solutions. Combined with improving relevance, our scale is a powerful asset. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, eBay has 5 categories that each generate more than $10 billion annually in GMV, making up more than 80% of volume on our marketplace in aggregate.  Our global footprint across 190 markets and density of supply and demand across major trade corridors are tremendous advantages in cross-border trade, and our proprietary data assets are powered by tens of billions of cumulative transactions and commercially relevant product information and images accumulated over our nearly 28-year history.  Our scale enabled us to launch a proprietary managed payment solution capable of processing more than $70 billion in annualized volume in less than 2 years. It also allowed us to build our nearly $1.3 billion advertising business driven by Promoted Listings, which help our sellers drive greater velocity and price realization for their inventory.  Ads and payments have dramatically enhanced our financial architecture. But now we are widening the scope of scalable solutions on eBay to develop a broader suite of value-added services. Our payments infrastructure makes it possible for us to launch new financial services like FX conversion, alternative payment options and seller financing partnerships informed by transactions on eBay.  We're also investing in improved in-house risk modeling to alleviate transactional friction for sellers and buyers on eBay, which has led to measurable uplift in conversion and hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV during the first half of 2023 alone. Our scale and cross-border capabilities allowed us to launch the eBay international shipping program earlier this year.  This program simplifies paperwork, lowers cost for buyers, streamlines returns and enables sellers to tap into our global demand. While this program is still ramping up in the U.S., we are seeing positive proof points in the number of listings migrated, increased exportability of new listings as well as conversion, delivery times and operational costs in line with our expectations.  The cross-category nature of eBay makes our investments in individual focus categories more scalable to other areas. This is because technology and capabilities that are developed for one category can be adapted quickly and seamlessly to others.  For instance, eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program has enabled us to rapidly transform trust across new categories and countries, from watches to sneakers, handbags, jewelry and trading cards. Now it's faster and more cost-efficient to launch authentication for a new category like we did this quarter with streetwear. We believe only eBay is in a position to bring hyper relevant experiences like these to customers at scale across this breadth of categories.  Lastly, our third pillar is magical innovations. The foundational work we've accomplished over the past 3 years has set us up for a new phase of innovation. Our teams are focused on thinking bigger and moving faster as we build game-changing features and functionality for customers to keep eBay at the forefront of e-commerce.  Our improved tech velocity has allowed us to launch and rapidly iterate on exciting features like live commerce. Other examples include the ability to instantly buy and sell trading cards in the eBay vault and our improved computer vision capabilities that streamline buying and selling on eBay.  Over the next few quarters and years, we expect advancements in artificial intelligence, including Generative AI to impact nearly every aspect of our organization, driving meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements. More importantly, they enable truly compelling customer-facing experiences that I'm confident our customers will love, such as the Magical Listing experience I'm excited to discuss with you shortly.  You will continue to hear us talk about the progress of our evolved strategy and how we're delivering on the three pillars of relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. This work is all in service of our plan to reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay.  As I've mentioned, these efforts are already underway, and we've begun delivering these innovative features and functionality to eBay customers.  Now let me turn to the second quarter. We delivered better-than-expected results across the board in Q2 despite continued macro uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was over $18.2 billion while revenue grew 5% to $2.54 billion and outpaced GMV growth by roughly 6 points, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 5%.  Our improving growth trends continue to be led by our focused categories, which grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during Q2. This outperformance continues to be led by motors, parts and accessories or P&A where GMV grew mid-single digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, which we believe is in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce.  We also extended our focus category coverage through new launches and category expansions during the quarter. In early June, we launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear in the U.S. and are now authenticating new and pre-owned streetwear items from 20 trusted brands, including Kith, Off-White, Palace and Supreme. In July, we expanded eligible streetwear to mass appeal brands like Adidas, Jordan and Nike. And later this year, we'll expand coverage to luxury brands, including Gucci, Prada, and Louis Vuitton. This marks our entry into authenticated apparel, a category that has strong overlap with our passionate community of sneaker enthusiasts, adding another layer of trust when they shop.  In April, we launched a Certified by Brand program, which we also expect to facilitate more e-commerce in the luxury space. There are already more than 20 brands participating in this program. offering new and certified preowned inventory across the watch, jewelry and handbag categories.  Listings from this program will show a direct-from-brand or brand-authorized seller badge, bringing an enhanced level of trust to these listings similar to visual trust signals for Authenticity Guarantee.  Brands benefit from eBay's scale demand, gain access to consumer and pricing insights while being able to maintain control of their brand equity and image online. eBay shoppers will benefit from these brands' unique inventory and enhanced trust as these products will include certifications and/or warranties from the brands themselves.  Our expertise in fashion is further extended by our recently closed acquisition of Certilogo, a provider of AI-powered authentication for apparel. Certilogo empowers brands and designers to manage the life cycle of their garments, protect their customers from counterfeits and encourages e-commerce via QR codes that serve as digital product passports.  While we are just beginning to explore the synergies between our companies, Certilogo already works with a number of leading global fashion brands, and we are incredibly excited to leverage this technology to accelerate the circular economy.  Next, I'd like to discuss the groundbreaking work our team is doing with artificial intelligence. In particular, I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we're ramping up a new feature we've been calling Magical Listing, which will make it significantly easier for sellers to list their inventory.  One of the biggest challenges to operating a listings-based marketplace is the burden on sellers to fill in descriptions and item aspects for their products. In May, we launched the first version of our Magical Listing experience, which dramatically reduces this friction for our sellers via AI-generated item descriptions.  We integrated Azure's open AI API into our core listing flow. And now sellers can choose to have detailed product information instantly populated by Generative AI based on the product's title, category and any item aspects that have been input.  During the quarter, we ramped this beta feature to more than 50% of iOS and Android users in the U.S. and expect to reach 100% in the coming weeks. Early signals have been extremely positive. Approximately 30% of users have tried the feature at least once, and we've observed acceptance rates of over 90% for AI-generated descriptions, including those with edits.  Customer satisfaction is over 80% thus far, which is among the highest CSAT for any new feature launched in recent memory. Sellers have told us that this feature will unlock more of the unique inventory in their closets. And on average, we are seeing description lengths double when Gen AI is used.  But we are just getting started. The next iteration of our Magical Listing will leverage our improved image recognition capabilities to provide flows with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing.  Sellers can utilize their smartphone camera or existing photos to start a listing. And based on our visual understanding of the products, the eBay app can pre-populate the title, category, description and item specifics wherever possible. We have been testing this tool with our employees for several weeks, and we're incredibly excited to launch in public beta in the coming months.  The advent of Generative AI has sparked an explosion of creativity at eBay among our product and engineering teams who have conceptualized new and innovative shopping experiences that can be rapidly deployed onto the site. Two compelling examples that launched in July are the Shop by Upgrade and engine code lookup features that went from concept to production in the eBay Motors app in just a few weeks.  Shop by Upgrade uses Generative AI to help customers discover the most relevant fitment-enabled upgrade options for their vehicles, which are personalized based on a specific user's preferences. Engine code lookup offers specific P&A products available on eBay that can address the root cause of hard-to-decipher error codes, aiding them in identifying and fixing the source of the problem.  I'm thrilled to see how quickly our teams are moving with this technology at their disposal and look forward to more of these experiences launching in pilots in the months ahead.  Turning next to our advertising business, which continues to build impressive momentum. We reached a major milestone in Q2 as advertising revenue reached 2% penetration of GMV. Total ads grew 35% while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV. Over 2.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q2, while we reached more than 800 million live promoted listings. Promoted Listings Standard, our CPA product was again the largest contributor to growth in Q2, driven by attribution enhancements, continued optimization and ad rate improvements. At the end of March, we adjusted our attribution methodology for CPA ads, expanding the definition of what constitutes a qualified sale. This change, referred to as a halo attribution in the industry, enabled us to more efficiently optimize our ads as we capture a more complete picture of the downstream sales driven by promoted listings. While sellers maintain the full flexibility to adjust their bidding behavior after this change, halo attribution had a net positive impact on our ad business in Q2.  During the quarter, we also introduced a new way to rank ads on search which leverages our in-house AI capabilities to optimize CPA placements for both conversion and ad rate. Additionally, we improved our precision in calculating trending and suggested ad rates and made it easier to adopt dynamic bidding, both contributed to a modest lift in Q2 ad rate. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also scaled nicely in Q2, growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our CPC product was the largest contributor. Advanced recently exited beta into general release as we have simplified the process of creating and managing campaigns, increased the visibility of CPC ads on eBay and demonstrated healthy return on ad spend levels to sellers.  During Q2, we introduced suggested campaigns for Advanced, which provide a one-click activation experience by offering customized keywords, bid and ad group structures for B2C sellers across 5 major markets. These campaigns were pushed out to sellers on a monthly cadence and can drive further adoption of CPC ads. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. Last quarter, we published our annual impact report, which recognizes the progress we've made to our environmental and social goals. As a pioneer of e-commerce, we are committed to helping sellers earn extra cash selling pre-loved items and helping buyers find items of value while promoting a healthier planet and economy. I'm proud that we continue to make important strides to our own climate goals while leading sustainability throughout our company culture and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, we will soon publish our first ever U.K. social impact report, which takes a closer look at the programs we're delivering for hundreds of underserved entrepreneurs, social enterprises and charities in the U.K. This includes programs like eBay for Change, which supports social entrepreneurs and creates jobs in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Another program with considerable impact is eBay for Charity which raised more than $38 million during the quarter. And I'm excited to announce that Engage for Good, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the practice of cause marketing recognized eBay for Charity as a 2023 charity checkout champion. In closing, I would like to thank our incredible employees for another strong quarter of execution and for continuing to bring our strategic vision to life. I have never been more confident that we are on the right path to unlocking our enormous untapped potential and reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. Our focus on relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations will greatly benefit our loyal community of sellers and buyers in the quarters and years ahead as well as better cater to the needs of the next generation of online shoppers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and offer some additional commentary on the remainder of the year before we begin Q&A.  As usual, my comments will reflect the year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q2 as our GMV, revenue and EPS exceeded expectations and came in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1. Revenue was up 5% to $2.54 billion, which outpaced volume by 6 points, driven by accelerating growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 26.9%, down roughly 1.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of eBay international shipping ramp and recent M&A. We delivered $1.03 in non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow while returning $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of our financial performance during the second quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1 due to continued momentum within focused categories and a notable acceleration in cross-border trading. Foreign exchange represented a 1 point headwind to reported GMV growth in Q2.  GMV growth in our focus categories accelerated modestly and outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 7 points during the second quarter. We launched a new focus category in U.S. streetwear, extended trading cards to Canada and broadened our inventory coverage in sneakers, handbags and jewelery which drove a sequential increase in GMV coverage.  P&A was once again the largest contributor to GMV growth among focused categories, growing in the mid-single digits year-over-year in line with estimated market growth in this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished maintained healthy double-digit growth in Q2 and was the second largest contributor to focus category outperformance as consumers continue to turn to eBay for value in the current economic climate.  Next, looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 4% organically in Q2, as domestic buyers continue to favor imports due to diminishing headwinds within global supply chains that benefited cross-border trade. International GMV grew 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 2 points sequentially. Although e-commerce growth remains weaker outside of the U.S. amidst heightened macro challenges, international GMV benefited from a sequential acceleration in volume from cross-border trading.  Moving to active buyers. 132 million active buyers shop on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in June, down 1 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we've ceased operations in July of last year, we had 131 million active buyers, roughly flat versus Q1. As we lap the Turkey closure this month, this factor will no longer be a headwind to reported active buyers next quarter.  The continued stabilization of our buyer count was driven by the four straight quarters of positive year-over-year growth in new and reactivated buyers, which was again led by double-digit growth in buyers from P&A. In isolation, new buyers grew year-over-year for the second straight quarter, while growth by our churn has steadily improved throughout 2023. Enthusiast buyers was stable at 16 million in Q2, as net migration patterns improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. Spend per enthusiast grew modestly year-over-year, averaging roughly $3,000 annually.  Turning to revenue. We generated net revenue of $2.54 billion in Q2, up 5%, an acceleration of roughly 3 points versus Q1. Total FX-neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A, was 6% while currency was a 1 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9% in Q2, more than 30 basis points sequentially and up nearly 90 basis points year-over-year. Advertising revenue was the largest driver of our take rate growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. eBay international shipping and recent M&A in aggregate contributed nearly 10 basis points to our Q2 take rate sequentially, while new payment services contributed roughly 2 basis points. Foreign exchange represented a sequential headwind of approximately 10 basis points to take rate in the second quarter. Our advertising business accelerated notably in Q2 as total ad revenue grew 35%, a 12-point acceleration versus Q1. First-party ads grew 49% or roughly 50 points faster than volume as the GMV delta widened by 17 points sequentially. However, roughly 4 points of this gap were related to a one-time accounting adjustment of deferred revenue on cost per click ad fees following the halo attribution change Jamie discussed earlier. The deferral release brought forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue to Q2, which we will lap in Q3. The outstanding results within our ads business were driven by continued optimization of promoted listings standards and the expansion of our emerging products like advanced and external promoted listings. As we lap one-time factors like our ad portfolio expansion, recent product optimization wins, halo attribution and the one-time accounting change, we do expect the GMV delta to narrow from current levels. However, we still anticipate advertising revenue will outpace GMV for the foreseeable future.  Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% in Q2, down 1.7 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.5 points of this delta is due to the combination of eBay international shipping and recent M&A, while FX also represented a modest year-over-year headwind. Gross margin was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a 1 point headwind from the progressive ramp of eBay international shipping which was partly offset by an increase in take rate driven by ads and other monetization efficiencies.  Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was down nearly 80 basis points year-over-year in Q2 as our continued investment in full funnel marketing initiatives was offset by leverage on monetization efficiencies and lower spend on coupons and incentives. Product development rose by 1.1 points as we continue to invest in product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation across the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 60 basis points, driven by M&A and higher employee spend. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 4% net reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 with the delta primarily driven by unrealized losses on our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $492 million in Q2, up 6%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, and we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 million. We repurchased roughly $250 million in shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q2 and have roughly $2.3 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization.  We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $133 million in June or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.4 billion at the end of Q2. This represents a decrease of approximately $200 million sequentially, driven primarily by the recent share price decline in Adevinta.  Moving on to our outlook. For the third quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.6 billion and $18 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 4% and negative 1% year-over-year. We expect revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.52 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between 2% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 25.8% and 26.5%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01 representing EPS growth between negative 4% and positive 1% year-over-year.  We are currently planning our business around the assumption of total FX-neutral GMV growth between negative 2% and negative 1% year-over-year for the full year of 2023. We expect revenue to outpace GMV by approximately 4.5 points for the full year on a spot basis.  Although FX-neutral revenue growth should continue to outpace GMV by mid-single digits during the second half, at current FX rates, our year-over-year growth in spot revenue and GMV would converge in Q4 as we lap significant FX hedging gains in the prior year period. We are now planning for full year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins between 27% and 27.4%. Our margin assumptions contemplate a year-over-year headwind of roughly 1 point from the combination of recent M&A and the eBay international shipping program. However, we do expect the operating margin impact from EIS to abate by the fourth quarter. Our margin assumptions imply more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program in 2023, which will be redeployed into strategic objectives.  If foreign currencies follow the current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of roughly 0.5 point to GMV growth for the full year in 2023. However, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point headwind to operating margin for 2023 with approximately 2 points of impact during Q4 alone due to hedging gains in the prior year period. FX also represents more than a 2-point headwind to non-GAAP EPS for the full year.  Lastly, for the full year, we expect to generate just under $2 billion in free cash flow. Due to California state disaster tax relief, the majority of our cash tax payments scheduled for 2023 have been deferred and will be paid in October. As such, we expect the bulk of our remaining 2023 free cash flow to be recognized in Q3. We estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain unchanged at 16.5% throughout the rest of 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are still estimated to be between 4% to 6% of revenue. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay as we delivered against our quarterly financial commitments and made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. Focus categories expanded in coverage and positively influenced growth for the marketplace overall. Our advertising business is driving robust growth at scale as first-party ads meaningfully accelerated relative to GMV. We continue to invest in product and full funnel marketing initiatives in a disciplined manner laying the foundation for sustainable growth, and we generated $492 million of free cash flow, returned $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and have returned roughly 130% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 18 months.  I continue to be inspired by the accelerating pace of innovation at eBay as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe bridging the strategy to potential impact for the P&L. When you think about the 3 pillars you laid out that you're investing behind over the medium to long term, how should we think either collectively or individually of those pillars as drivers of either buyer growth, continued ramp in spend per buyer and/or potentially amplifying ROI on the platform over the medium to long term?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, we're excited about the evolution of our strategy here with reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. When you look at the pillars, Eric, first on relevant experiences, we've had a lot of success with this to date, right? Our focus categories have been about creating relevant experiences in specific categories and we've seen a CSAT change, a GMV change, et cetera. And so we're expanding this now to kind of every site-wide experience that we have on the site, including a new design for Gen Z shoppers, including going to every e-mail, every notification. And frankly, new technology and tools enable us to do that. And so we feel really great about that and the impact on customer satisfaction and on GMV. On the scalable solutions, think about all the foundational work that we've done in payments and really being able to take that to the next level with things like financial services and building on that or eBay International Services.  When you combine the scale of eBay in 100 countries with the GMV that we do, we're able to roll out programs like the EIS, eBay International Shipping, and open up that opportunity for our sellers and just drive a lot more cross-border trade and a lot easier experience for our sellers. And then think of magical innovations is really raising the bar on the experience that we're going to have on the site. I talked about some of the new AI products that we're launching. I mean, these are products that are out the gate having over 80% customer satisfaction, having sellers tell us this is going to unlock more inventory because you're making it so easy to list on the platform, products like live commerce. We've now done over 300 live commerce and sellers and buyers are getting really engaged in that. And so that opportunity for us is to drive that customer lifetime value for a buyer as well as attract those new buyers on the platform. What I'm excited by is really the intersection of a couple of these. When you think about the intersection of relevant experiences combined with scalable solutions, only eBay can provide that, and that's why we think we're going to be able to reinvent the future of e-commerce in a really uniquely eBay way.\nStephen Priest: Eric, if you think about the financial architecture in terms of linked to the P&L, you're seeing us continue to invest. The underlying business, as we're moving forward is in a very healthy space. We're seeing great momentum not only with the focus categories, but also the monetization initiatives and the strength on the horizontal platform. And so we continue to invest to drive the momentum in the underlying business. We remain committed to the architecture that we put out back at our Investor Day last year with the sorts of mid-single-digit GMV growth and the P&L architecture that comes off the back of that. The timing of that, as we always said, will be a function of the macro environment that we continue to operate in. So hopefully, that covers the question for you from the link between strategy and architecture.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nikhil Divani with Bernstein.\nNikhil Devnani: My first one is on margins. I think the operating margin has kind of stepped down this year, and that's continuing to the back half as well. Can you just talk about the primary factors that are weighing on that and the degree to which they are temporary versus structural?  I know you're not guiding to '24 yet, but when you think about next year, what are the levers that would allow you to improve from this kind of 26% margin level?\nStephen Priest: Let me give you a little bit of color on the year-over-year margin. Obviously, we have seen some modest deleverage associated with the current macro environment, which obviously reflected in our full year GMV commentary, and that's bringing a lot of pressure on margins. I would refer probably to 4 discrete items that have impacted 2023. Firstly, we've talked about eBay international shipping. This is both strategically important for us as we open up the aperture across 132 million buyers across 190 countries and gives us a great opportunity to drive more commerce through eBay and, at the same time, drive accretive operating profit dollars. As a reminder for you all, we are now the principal in that relationship versus an agent and, therefore, the accounting treatment has impacted our margins in '23.  The second item will be around M&A. We have been more acquisitive of late to drive sustainable long-term growth in the business. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we would expect EIS and M&A together to be a 1 point headwind to margins in '23.  The third element, which is slightly nuanced is the FX fluctuations and lapping that we have seen or will see through the second half of the year. We did benefit from significant hedging gains in the fourth quarter of 2022, which we will ultimately lap. And in totality, that will equate to 0.5 point of FX-driven margin dilution for the full year and 2 points in quarter 4 alone.  And then finally, obviously, the reinvestments in our business. We are seeing focused category momentum, 7 points of growth over the core platform, horizontal investments in search and buyer and seller experience are driving dividends. And obviously, the investments in our monetization initiatives like payments and ads is bearing fruit.  And so as I think about margins for 2023, we have some unique items, as I've said, such as eBay International Shipping, the M&A and the FX fluctuations we've talked about. But we've also been investing in the business because we feel very confident about the trajectory of the business and how it's driving long-term sustainable growth.  I think that as it pertains to 2024, I'm not going to get ahead of myself. We've given you a lot of color for the third quarter. We've added some color for the full year. We are -- remain committed, as I mentioned to Eric, to the medium-term goals that we've put out at our investor event. This will really -- the timing will be the function of the duration and severity of the macro headwinds we're currently facing. And obviously, we'll give additional color for '24 in the quarters ahead.\nNikhil Devnani: And you alluded to that Investor Day GMV framework, which kind of assumed the non-focus categories would be flat. I guess what's the strategy in your playbook to ensure that those non-focus verticals also remain stable going forward?\nJamie Iannone: First of all, our strategy when we go back to it in terms of relevant experiences on the site, we're doing a lot of work outside of just the work that we're doing in focus categories. In fact, the majority of our investment is going there. So if you think about the magical listing experience, that's going to help unlock C2C inventory across every category on the site. The second thing I would say is that when you think about our model and what we laid out, we have a real multiplier effect on our buyers. So as we continue to roll out focus categories and as we're seeing success there, that actually helps lift all tides across the eBay marketplace.  So take a sneakers buyer. The average sneaker buyer comes in and buys sneakers over $100, they're going to spend $400 in sneakers but then $2,000 on the rest of the platform outside of that. And that nature really allows us to help grow the overall marketplace, including our non-focus categories.  The last thing I'd say is when you think about things like the scalable solutions that we're building, take eBay international shipping, that's going to help every category. That's going to help focus categories like handbags coming out of Japan, et cetera, but it's also going to help our non-focus categories. And when you think about cross-border trade on the platform, it's really 1 in 5 transactions or 20%. So it you a lot of opportunity, both in our focus category work and the non-focus category work, and we feel committed and confident in our ability to get those to fly in the medium term.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Morton: I would like to maybe start off with EIS being deployed in the U.S. currently. If we could talk about any contributions you're seeing at this point to U.S. GMV. And maybe some color on timing and kind of contribution expectations going forward would be great because it seems like it's a program that you're very excited about. And then a second question, we've talked about the full funnel marketing spend in the past, and you've mentioned millennials and Gen Z and the active buyer numbers have been improving. I was -- would love to dig down on those cohorts maybe a bit or if you could kind of bucket the strength you're seeing in active buyers. Are you having some effectiveness in converting the millennials and Gen Z who have maybe grown up in a different era of interacting with marketplaces?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Okay. So first, let me talk about eBay international shipping. So the whole program makes cross-border shipping and selling much easier. So eBay handles the custom forms, we handle the duties. We handle the immediate returns. And sellers are protected from things like item not received claims on the platform. So we're in the process of basically rolling this out. Most sellers are adopting it. And while it's early days for the new program, we're seeing a really positive reception from sellers in terms of shippable listings, the conversion that we're seeing, et cetera.  Why we're excited by it is because 20% of the business on eBay is cross-border, but less than half of our big 3 inventory is available to be shipped internationally. So opening up that inventory, we think, is a unique advantage for eBay and a unique value proposition for our sellers on the marketplace.  When you think about the full funnel marketing that we're doing and that shift, we're really seeing it pay off in terms of our buyer strategy. So this quarter, we saw, once again, new or reactivated buyers was positive for the fourth straight quarter. Our new buyer growth was positive for the second quarter. And take a category like P&A where we've been doing full funnel marketing, really targeting on enthusiasts, there, we're seeing that new and reactivated buyer growth being double digits faster than the rest of the platform. So we feel really good that the investments that we're making are driving the right buyer outcomes. They're exactly where we expect them to be and where I've been talking that they would be. And when you look at it, categories like what we're doing in sneakers. This quarter, we just launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear, which is a great kind of Gen Z younger consumer category. We're in the middle of sponsoring fashion island -- sorry, Love Island in the U.K., which is kind of currently on air right now, sponsored by our eBay U.K. business, also bringing in a different type of cohort. So we feel really good that the strategy is working. We're bringing in the enthusiast buyers that we want and that we're seeing a great payoff out of the full funnel marketing approach.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\nKenneth Gawrelski: A couple of more kind of macro and competitive questions, please. First, could you just speak to where we are in the evolution of the consumer preference for goods versus services? Have you seen a normalization of that trend? And has there been any benefit yet in results? And then the second one, could you just speak about the competitive environment, especially in the kind of the lower end of the market, maybe where we've seen in the market where there have been some aggressive moves by China drop shippers. Anything you could touch on there, any impact you may be seeing and what actions you might be taking to combat those efforts?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, on the first one, clearly, inflation and rising are impacting discretionary demand. I think what makes our platform more resilient is that consumers can come here and find amazing values. So if you think about the refurbished category, which has been a focus category of ours, that grew double digits year-over-year and was the second largest contributor towards our focus category outperformance. In general, on the platform, we're seeing used growing faster than new. And that's what's great about eBay on the buy side. On the sell side, it is also a place to make extra income. And so we're really leaning into what we're doing on a C2C standpoint, including the new Magical Listing rollout because tougher economic times are an opportunity for us to bring more sellers onto the marketplace. When you think about the kind of a lower ASP market or the cross-border trade, as you mentioned, we noted that this quarter, we're actually seeing some strength in the cross-border trade of our business. That has to do with supply chain easing up and there being an opportunity for those sellers to export items in. And so we're actually seeing good health in what we're doing from a cross-border trade business. We've been doing a lot to enable that and make it easier. I talked about eBay international shipping, but we've also been rolling out new capabilities and payments over the past couple of quarters. with buyer and seller FX to make the payments process of that easier.  And we've been working on with some of our sellers to do forward deploying of our inventory which has just helped kind of ease some of that supply chain pressure. So overall, we feel really good about the values that people are getting from this and the initiatives that we're investing in to make it easier for our sellers to export items throughout the globe.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolf Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Two quick ones from us. First, can you add additional color on the factors driving strong trends in the first-party ads business? Are sellers also seeing additional performance gains or is this primarily driven by expansion in ad load in some of the areas of the website? And then second, on M&A, Steve, you alluded to kind of being acquisitive, how should we think about the appetite over the next few quarters? Are there any specific areas where you think there are additional opportunities?\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So our first-party ads is really a success based on the execution of the team and what we're seeing in terms of return on ad spend. So this quarter, we grew 49% year-on-year.  Some of that is due to some one-time factors. Steve talked about the accounting change that we've had. We also talked about the halo attribution that we rolled out for sellers. But in general, it's really based on the success of the products and the innovation that we're seeing.  So if you look at our Promoted Listing Standard, it continues to be the workhorse of our advertising portfolio where we're driving more optimization and more relevance. And secondarily, when you look at our new products, they once again grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. They're the -- key one being Promoted Listings in Advanced. And the team continues to innovate to make it easier for sellers. So this quarter, we launched a feature called suggested campaign which makes it easier for sellers to add Promoted Listings Advanced to the work that they're already doing in advertising. And as we talked about, we now have 2.1 million sellers using the product and 800 million listings.  So we feel great about the growth that we're seeing there. As Steve commented, some of that gap will narrow because of some of these onetime factors, but we see revenue continuing to pace out GMV because of the success of what we're doing in ads. Steve, maybe you want to take the second one?\nStephen Priest: Yes. So we've been very thoughtful and considerate as we've looked to M&A, it's really to structurally improve the core marketplace. And so if you think about where we've , my shipment is really helping fuel and support the growth in parts and accessories, our biggest focus category. We recently launched in the TCG Player, which is supporting our trading card business. And Certilogo, which is the most recent acquisition really supporting our fashion category. So we've been very, very thoughtful about the entities that we lean into and partner with or we ultimately buy to really support the long-term sustainable growth of the platform, and we'll continue to be thoughtful. And as a group, we look at each potential acquisition on its merits and make the best decisions to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. And I'd just add, if you look at Certilogo as an example, it's a perfect acquisition for eBay. They have great relationships with brands. They're driving this ability to have these unique QR codes to make sure that products are authentic, and it's leading into a trend that we're seeing, frankly, two trends. One is the younger Gen Z consumer caring more about sustainability and preloved and what happens with garments. And frankly, governments and regulators, especially in Europe, making sure that products don't go into the landfill, but they get a second and third and fourth life, which drives consistently right into the strategy that we've been talking about as the pioneers of e-commerce and driving the circular economy and driving the benefits for the overall planet.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\nThomas Champion: We were positively surprised by international GMV growth this quarter while domestic was maybe a little bit lower. Just curious, any context or one-timers to consider here? And Jamie, I'm curious with the marketplace essentially flat year-over-year for the first half, would it be reasonable to expect GMV to return to positive growth in '24.  Maybe for Steve. It's a more reserved year for buybacks. Any reason why you wouldn't monetize the Adevinta stake to bridge the gap between the current period and maybe a return to GMV growth? Any comments on those would be really helpful.\nStephen Priest: Tom, I'll pick up the first one and the third. I'll let Jamie comment on the second. So the first one with regards to international versus U.S. GMV dynamics, there's a couple of items that are worth reflecting on. As a reminder for you all, the GMV is reflected on the geography where the seller is domiciled, i.e., where the sale takes place.  So first, it's associated with lapping dynamics. If you recall, Europe, in particular, got hit harder as we sort of went through the awful events of the war in Ukraine and the economic fallout associated with that. And they got hurt earlier, and we started to lap through that versus the U.S. in the first half of 2022. Secondly, we saw the supply chain challenges that we're also lapping and the easing of those supply chains, particularly for our cross-border business that Jamie talked about earlier is helping drive international GMV momentum as we have an increase in cross-border trade, obviously fueled by some of the benefit from eBay international shipping.  The one thing I would say on the overall GMV basis, I continue to be very enthused by the overall level of momentum because we're leaning not only to focus category in the U.S. but also internationally, and those investments are bearing fruit across all of our geographies. Jamie, do you want to just touch on the other question before I talk about capital...\nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, I think the momentum we're seeing is a reflection of the strategy that we have laid out and seeing it working. So if you think about focus categories, which was our largest one that we've -- we took on P&A, which was our largest one that we've taken on to date, having that grow mid-single digits, the category over $10 billion and be at market rates of growth speaks to the fact that we know how to roll out this playbook and make it successful. And frankly, we're continuing to invest back into categories that we've already launched because of the return that we're seeing. We feel good about things like what we're seeing in refurb with the double-digit growth, et cetera, the success that we're seeing in ads and payments.  So we're really happy with the momentum that we have there. As Steve talked about, we'll kind of deal through the macro pieces. But we're continuing to invest behind the strategy because we feel like it's working and the investments are really paying off for the customer and for shareholders.\nStephen Priest: Tom, specifically pertaining to your question on capital returns, we remain committed to the return of 125% of free cash flow as we talked about to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends between '22 and '24. As I look over the last 18 months, we've returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, which is 130% of free cash flow. Specifically around certain assets that we hold, I'm not going to share any specific details on any of our specific investment stakes, but it will continue to be our priority as it's always been to drive a disciplined approach and to maximize shareholder value through the investment portfolio.\nJamie Iannone: Operator, can we do one final question, please?\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nWesley Sanford: It's Wes on for Doug. Just a quick question on P&A. Outperformance has been solid, but just kind of curious what you're seeing on the supply side there or if you feel like you're constrained on any front on P&A.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. No, Wes, we're seeing good supply from our sellers in that category. I mean if you look overall in the business, supply is in great shape. We did.9 billion listings on the platform. We have over 500 million in P&A. The key for us has really been helping sellers make sense of -- I mean helping buyers make sense of all that inventory.  And as we roll out the new fitment changes, as we've rolled out guaranteed fitment, we're finding that the experience is just so much easier for all of our segments of key buyers, whether they're now using the My Garage feature on the site. We just launched these 2 new AI features which enable us to make the buying experience so much better.  Once we know your car, we can tell you, here's the key upgrades to do. We can help you with things like your engine codes. And look, this is the second quarter of mid-single-digit growth, which we believe is at market rates of growth. And so we're feeling great about that.  As I said, our buyers in P&A are growing double digits faster than the rest of the markets when you look at our new and reactivated buyers. So we're pleased with what we're seeing. We're continuing to invest and roll out new features and new capabilities. We're seeing particular strength in CBT right now. But overall, really pleased with what we're seeing in our motors P&A, and frankly, across our focus category portfolio.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the second quarter on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll review our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and offer some additional commentary on the remainder of the year before we begin Q&A.  As usual, my comments will reflect the year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis unless I note otherwise. We delivered solid results in Q2 as our GMV, revenue and EPS exceeded expectations and came in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1. Revenue was up 5% to $2.54 billion, which outpaced volume by 6 points, driven by accelerating growth within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin is 26.9%, down roughly 1.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of eBay international shipping ramp and recent M&A. We delivered $1.03 in non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $492 million of free cash flow while returning $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at the key drivers of our financial performance during the second quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to $18.2 billion, an improvement from down 3% in Q1 due to continued momentum within focused categories and a notable acceleration in cross-border trading. Foreign exchange represented a 1 point headwind to reported GMV growth in Q2.  GMV growth in our focus categories accelerated modestly and outpaced the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 7 points during the second quarter. We launched a new focus category in U.S. streetwear, extended trading cards to Canada and broadened our inventory coverage in sneakers, handbags and jewelery which drove a sequential increase in GMV coverage.  P&A was once again the largest contributor to GMV growth among focused categories, growing in the mid-single digits year-over-year in line with estimated market growth in this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished maintained healthy double-digit growth in Q2 and was the second largest contributor to focus category outperformance as consumers continue to turn to eBay for value in the current economic climate.  Next, looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 4% organically in Q2, as domestic buyers continue to favor imports due to diminishing headwinds within global supply chains that benefited cross-border trade. International GMV grew 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 2 points sequentially. Although e-commerce growth remains weaker outside of the U.S. amidst heightened macro challenges, international GMV benefited from a sequential acceleration in volume from cross-border trading.  Moving to active buyers. 132 million active buyers shop on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in June, down 1 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we've ceased operations in July of last year, we had 131 million active buyers, roughly flat versus Q1. As we lap the Turkey closure this month, this factor will no longer be a headwind to reported active buyers next quarter.  The continued stabilization of our buyer count was driven by the four straight quarters of positive year-over-year growth in new and reactivated buyers, which was again led by double-digit growth in buyers from P&A. In isolation, new buyers grew year-over-year for the second straight quarter, while growth by our churn has steadily improved throughout 2023. Enthusiast buyers was stable at 16 million in Q2, as net migration patterns improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. Spend per enthusiast grew modestly year-over-year, averaging roughly $3,000 annually.  Turning to revenue. We generated net revenue of $2.54 billion in Q2, up 5%, an acceleration of roughly 3 points versus Q1. Total FX-neutral revenue growth, inclusive of M&A, was 6% while currency was a 1 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9% in Q2, more than 30 basis points sequentially and up nearly 90 basis points year-over-year. Advertising revenue was the largest driver of our take rate growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. eBay international shipping and recent M&A in aggregate contributed nearly 10 basis points to our Q2 take rate sequentially, while new payment services contributed roughly 2 basis points. Foreign exchange represented a sequential headwind of approximately 10 basis points to take rate in the second quarter. Our advertising business accelerated notably in Q2 as total ad revenue grew 35%, a 12-point acceleration versus Q1. First-party ads grew 49% or roughly 50 points faster than volume as the GMV delta widened by 17 points sequentially. However, roughly 4 points of this gap were related to a one-time accounting adjustment of deferred revenue on cost per click ad fees following the halo attribution change Jamie discussed earlier. The deferral release brought forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue to Q2, which we will lap in Q3. The outstanding results within our ads business were driven by continued optimization of promoted listings standards and the expansion of our emerging products like advanced and external promoted listings. As we lap one-time factors like our ad portfolio expansion, recent product optimization wins, halo attribution and the one-time accounting change, we do expect the GMV delta to narrow from current levels. However, we still anticipate advertising revenue will outpace GMV for the foreseeable future.  Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% in Q2, down 1.7 points year-over-year. Roughly 1.5 points of this delta is due to the combination of eBay international shipping and recent M&A, while FX also represented a modest year-over-year headwind. Gross margin was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a 1 point headwind from the progressive ramp of eBay international shipping which was partly offset by an increase in take rate driven by ads and other monetization efficiencies.  Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was down nearly 80 basis points year-over-year in Q2 as our continued investment in full funnel marketing initiatives was offset by leverage on monetization efficiencies and lower spend on coupons and incentives. Product development rose by 1.1 points as we continue to invest in product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation across the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 60 basis points, driven by M&A and higher employee spend. We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 4% net reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 with the delta primarily driven by unrealized losses on our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $492 million in Q2, up 6%. Our balance sheet position remains robust, and we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 million. We repurchased roughly $250 million in shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q2 and have roughly $2.3 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization.  We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $133 million in June or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 20 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.4 billion at the end of Q2. This represents a decrease of approximately $200 million sequentially, driven primarily by the recent share price decline in Adevinta.  Moving on to our outlook. For the third quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.6 billion and $18 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between negative 4% and negative 1% year-over-year. We expect revenue between $2.46 billion and $2.52 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth between 2% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 25.8% and 26.5%, and we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01 representing EPS growth between negative 4% and positive 1% year-over-year.  We are currently planning our business around the assumption of total FX-neutral GMV growth between negative 2% and negative 1% year-over-year for the full year of 2023. We expect revenue to outpace GMV by approximately 4.5 points for the full year on a spot basis.  Although FX-neutral revenue growth should continue to outpace GMV by mid-single digits during the second half, at current FX rates, our year-over-year growth in spot revenue and GMV would converge in Q4 as we lap significant FX hedging gains in the prior year period. We are now planning for full year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins between 27% and 27.4%. Our margin assumptions contemplate a year-over-year headwind of roughly 1 point from the combination of recent M&A and the eBay international shipping program. However, we do expect the operating margin impact from EIS to abate by the fourth quarter. Our margin assumptions imply more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program in 2023, which will be redeployed into strategic objectives.  If foreign currencies follow the current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of roughly 0.5 point to GMV growth for the full year in 2023. However, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point headwind to operating margin for 2023 with approximately 2 points of impact during Q4 alone due to hedging gains in the prior year period. FX also represents more than a 2-point headwind to non-GAAP EPS for the full year.  Lastly, for the full year, we expect to generate just under $2 billion in free cash flow. Due to California state disaster tax relief, the majority of our cash tax payments scheduled for 2023 have been deferred and will be paid in October. As such, we expect the bulk of our remaining 2023 free cash flow to be recognized in Q3. We estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain unchanged at 16.5% throughout the rest of 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are still estimated to be between 4% to 6% of revenue. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay as we delivered against our quarterly financial commitments and made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. Focus categories expanded in coverage and positively influenced growth for the marketplace overall. Our advertising business is driving robust growth at scale as first-party ads meaningfully accelerated relative to GMV. We continue to invest in product and full funnel marketing initiatives in a disciplined manner laying the foundation for sustainable growth, and we generated $492 million of free cash flow, returned $383 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and have returned roughly 130% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 18 months.  I continue to be inspired by the accelerating pace of innovation at eBay as we reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Eric, if you think about the financial architecture in terms of linked to the P&L, you're seeing us continue to invest. The underlying business, as we're moving forward is in a very healthy space. We're seeing great momentum not only with the focus categories, but also the monetization initiatives and the strength on the horizontal platform. And so we continue to invest to drive the momentum in the underlying business. We remain committed to the architecture that we put out back at our Investor Day last year with the sorts of mid-single-digit GMV growth and the P&L architecture that comes off the back of that. The timing of that, as we always said, will be a function of the macro environment that we continue to operate in. So hopefully, that covers the question for you from the link between strategy and architecture. Let me give you a little bit of color on the year-over-year margin. Obviously, we have seen some modest deleverage associated with the current macro environment, which obviously reflected in our full year GMV commentary, and that's bringing a lot of pressure on margins. I would refer probably to 4 discrete items that have impacted 2023. Firstly, we've talked about eBay international shipping. This is both strategically important for us as we open up the aperture across 132 million buyers across 190 countries and gives us a great opportunity to drive more commerce through eBay and, at the same time, drive accretive operating profit dollars. As a reminder for you all, we are now the principal in that relationship versus an agent and, therefore, the accounting treatment has impacted our margins in '23.  The second item will be around M&A. We have been more acquisitive of late to drive sustainable long-term growth in the business. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we would expect EIS and M&A together to be a 1 point headwind to margins in '23.  The third element, which is slightly nuanced is the FX fluctuations and lapping that we have seen or will see through the second half of the year. We did benefit from significant hedging gains in the fourth quarter of 2022, which we will ultimately lap. And in totality, that will equate to 0.5 point of FX-driven margin dilution for the full year and 2 points in quarter 4 alone.  And then finally, obviously, the reinvestments in our business. We are seeing focused category momentum, 7 points of growth over the core platform, horizontal investments in search and buyer and seller experience are driving dividends. And obviously, the investments in our monetization initiatives like payments and ads is bearing fruit.  And so as I think about margins for 2023, we have some unique items, as I've said, such as eBay International Shipping, the M&A and the FX fluctuations we've talked about. But we've also been investing in the business because we feel very confident about the trajectory of the business and how it's driving long-term sustainable growth.  I think that as it pertains to 2024, I'm not going to get ahead of myself. We've given you a lot of color for the third quarter. We've added some color for the full year. We are -- remain committed, as I mentioned to Eric, to the medium-term goals that we've put out at our investor event. This will really -- the timing will be the function of the duration and severity of the macro headwinds we're currently facing. And obviously, we'll give additional color for '24 in the quarters ahead. Yes. So we've been very thoughtful and considerate as we've looked to M&A, it's really to structurally improve the core marketplace. And so if you think about where we've , my shipment is really helping fuel and support the growth in parts and accessories, our biggest focus category. We recently launched in the TCG Player, which is supporting our trading card business. And Certilogo, which is the most recent acquisition really supporting our fashion category. So we've been very, very thoughtful about the entities that we lean into and partner with or we ultimately buy to really support the long-term sustainable growth of the platform, and we'll continue to be thoughtful. And as a group, we look at each potential acquisition on its merits and make the best decisions to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. Tom, I'll pick up the first one and the third. I'll let Jamie comment on the second. So the first one with regards to international versus U.S. GMV dynamics, there's a couple of items that are worth reflecting on. As a reminder for you all, the GMV is reflected on the geography where the seller is domiciled, i.e., where the sale takes place.  So first, it's associated with lapping dynamics. If you recall, Europe, in particular, got hit harder as we sort of went through the awful events of the war in Ukraine and the economic fallout associated with that. And they got hurt earlier, and we started to lap through that versus the U.S. in the first half of 2022. Secondly, we saw the supply chain challenges that we're also lapping and the easing of those supply chains, particularly for our cross-border business that Jamie talked about earlier is helping drive international GMV momentum as we have an increase in cross-border trade, obviously fueled by some of the benefit from eBay international shipping.  The one thing I would say on the overall GMV basis, I continue to be very enthused by the overall level of momentum because we're leaning not only to focus category in the U.S. but also internationally, and those investments are bearing fruit across all of our geographies. Jamie, do you want to just touch on the other question before I talk about capital... Tom, specifically pertaining to your question on capital returns, we remain committed to the return of 125% of free cash flow as we talked about to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends between '22 and '24. As I look over the last 18 months, we've returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, which is 130% of free cash flow. Specifically around certain assets that we hold, I'm not going to share any specific details on any of our specific investment stakes, but it will continue to be our priority as it's always been to drive a disciplined approach and to maximize shareholder value through the investment portfolio."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter in Q2, exceeding expectations across all key metrics while investing in a disciplined manner to support our long-term objectives.  Before I jump into the details around our second quarter results, I'd like to discuss the evolution of our strategy. Three years ago, I articulated our ambition of becoming the best global marketplace to buy and sell through a tech-led re-imagination of eBay. This would help us realize the enormous untapped potential of this company and put it firmly on a path to sustainable long-term growth.  Since then, we've renewed our focus on products where we are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful choices and value for our customers. We've accelerated innovation to adapt to the changing needs of buyers and developed world-class shopping experiences in our focus categories. And we've changed our marketing strategy to support these experiences, pivoting to a full funnel approach aimed at attracting and retaining enthusiast buyers. These accomplishments make it a logical time to embark on the next phase of our journey.  The foundational work of our tech-led re-imagination will continue, including our prioritization of non-new products, expansion of focus categories in ads and payments initiatives. And now we're raising the bar for innovation and have set our sights on an even more ambitious vision which is reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay.  We will achieve this vision in the coming years by focusing on 3 key pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. Let's start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. This means we are solving the specific and ever-changing needs of our customers across all shopping occasions.  Through our focus category strategy, we've proven that when we build relevant experiences, we can dramatically improve customer satisfaction which translates into faster GMV growth. While we'll continue to understand customer needs and innovate at the category level, we will leverage the new tools, capabilities and technologies we have developed over the last few years to enhance more elements of the site-wide experience.  This includes developing a more relevant, consistent experience for the next generation of online shoppers through a comprehensive overhaul of our user experience and design rolled out in phases over the course of 2023 and beyond. This evolution will result in simpler, more personalized browsing experiences that will inspire people to sell, shop and connect with their community on eBay.  This initiative is a cross-collaborative effort between design, product, core AI, search, engineering and other key stakeholders to ensure our modernized shopping experience is powered by intelligent computing at scale. Enabled by artificial intelligence, we will fine-tune the breadth of inventory and other aspects of the shopping journey to cater to the varying needs of new buyers, infrequent shoppers and eBay enthusiasts.  We believe these innovations will increase our ability to bend cohort curves, drive higher lifetime values and ultimately grow enthusiasts and average spend per buyer.  We began rolling out these changes to consumers in recent months, starting with testing a more modern and intuitive view item page, which is the most visited page on eBay.  The updated page offers a streamlined appearance, larger and higher resolution images and an optimized information hierarchy. Early tests indicate a measurable uplift in GMV versus our existing design.  Over the next few quarters, you will see a continued evolution of the look, feel and experience of our marketplace, including updates to view item, our header, homepage, search results and other landing pages.  Alongside this work, we're investing in new capabilities for search, where relevance is also critical. We're investing in technologies like deep learning and visual similarity to improve ranking and retrieval, reducing queries with low or no results to see if there's more of our amazing inventory for customers.  Now let's turn to our second pillar, scalable solutions. Combined with improving relevance, our scale is a powerful asset. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, eBay has 5 categories that each generate more than $10 billion annually in GMV, making up more than 80% of volume on our marketplace in aggregate.  Our global footprint across 190 markets and density of supply and demand across major trade corridors are tremendous advantages in cross-border trade, and our proprietary data assets are powered by tens of billions of cumulative transactions and commercially relevant product information and images accumulated over our nearly 28-year history.  Our scale enabled us to launch a proprietary managed payment solution capable of processing more than $70 billion in annualized volume in less than 2 years. It also allowed us to build our nearly $1.3 billion advertising business driven by Promoted Listings, which help our sellers drive greater velocity and price realization for their inventory.  Ads and payments have dramatically enhanced our financial architecture. But now we are widening the scope of scalable solutions on eBay to develop a broader suite of value-added services. Our payments infrastructure makes it possible for us to launch new financial services like FX conversion, alternative payment options and seller financing partnerships informed by transactions on eBay.  We're also investing in improved in-house risk modeling to alleviate transactional friction for sellers and buyers on eBay, which has led to measurable uplift in conversion and hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental GMV during the first half of 2023 alone. Our scale and cross-border capabilities allowed us to launch the eBay international shipping program earlier this year.  This program simplifies paperwork, lowers cost for buyers, streamlines returns and enables sellers to tap into our global demand. While this program is still ramping up in the U.S., we are seeing positive proof points in the number of listings migrated, increased exportability of new listings as well as conversion, delivery times and operational costs in line with our expectations.  The cross-category nature of eBay makes our investments in individual focus categories more scalable to other areas. This is because technology and capabilities that are developed for one category can be adapted quickly and seamlessly to others.  For instance, eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program has enabled us to rapidly transform trust across new categories and countries, from watches to sneakers, handbags, jewelry and trading cards. Now it's faster and more cost-efficient to launch authentication for a new category like we did this quarter with streetwear. We believe only eBay is in a position to bring hyper relevant experiences like these to customers at scale across this breadth of categories.  Lastly, our third pillar is magical innovations. The foundational work we've accomplished over the past 3 years has set us up for a new phase of innovation. Our teams are focused on thinking bigger and moving faster as we build game-changing features and functionality for customers to keep eBay at the forefront of e-commerce.  Our improved tech velocity has allowed us to launch and rapidly iterate on exciting features like live commerce. Other examples include the ability to instantly buy and sell trading cards in the eBay vault and our improved computer vision capabilities that streamline buying and selling on eBay.  Over the next few quarters and years, we expect advancements in artificial intelligence, including Generative AI to impact nearly every aspect of our organization, driving meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements. More importantly, they enable truly compelling customer-facing experiences that I'm confident our customers will love, such as the Magical Listing experience I'm excited to discuss with you shortly.  You will continue to hear us talk about the progress of our evolved strategy and how we're delivering on the three pillars of relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation. This work is all in service of our plan to reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay.  As I've mentioned, these efforts are already underway, and we've begun delivering these innovative features and functionality to eBay customers.  Now let me turn to the second quarter. We delivered better-than-expected results across the board in Q2 despite continued macro uncertainty. Gross merchandise volume was over $18.2 billion while revenue grew 5% to $2.54 billion and outpaced GMV growth by roughly 6 points, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 5%.  Our improving growth trends continue to be led by our focused categories, which grew roughly 7 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during Q2. This outperformance continues to be led by motors, parts and accessories or P&A where GMV grew mid-single digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, which we believe is in line with market rates of growth for this segment of e-commerce.  We also extended our focus category coverage through new launches and category expansions during the quarter. In early June, we launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear in the U.S. and are now authenticating new and pre-owned streetwear items from 20 trusted brands, including Kith, Off-White, Palace and Supreme. In July, we expanded eligible streetwear to mass appeal brands like Adidas, Jordan and Nike. And later this year, we'll expand coverage to luxury brands, including Gucci, Prada, and Louis Vuitton. This marks our entry into authenticated apparel, a category that has strong overlap with our passionate community of sneaker enthusiasts, adding another layer of trust when they shop.  In April, we launched a Certified by Brand program, which we also expect to facilitate more e-commerce in the luxury space. There are already more than 20 brands participating in this program. offering new and certified preowned inventory across the watch, jewelry and handbag categories.  Listings from this program will show a direct-from-brand or brand-authorized seller badge, bringing an enhanced level of trust to these listings similar to visual trust signals for Authenticity Guarantee.  Brands benefit from eBay's scale demand, gain access to consumer and pricing insights while being able to maintain control of their brand equity and image online. eBay shoppers will benefit from these brands' unique inventory and enhanced trust as these products will include certifications and/or warranties from the brands themselves.  Our expertise in fashion is further extended by our recently closed acquisition of Certilogo, a provider of AI-powered authentication for apparel. Certilogo empowers brands and designers to manage the life cycle of their garments, protect their customers from counterfeits and encourages e-commerce via QR codes that serve as digital product passports.  While we are just beginning to explore the synergies between our companies, Certilogo already works with a number of leading global fashion brands, and we are incredibly excited to leverage this technology to accelerate the circular economy.  Next, I'd like to discuss the groundbreaking work our team is doing with artificial intelligence. In particular, I'm excited to announce that this quarter, we're ramping up a new feature we've been calling Magical Listing, which will make it significantly easier for sellers to list their inventory.  One of the biggest challenges to operating a listings-based marketplace is the burden on sellers to fill in descriptions and item aspects for their products. In May, we launched the first version of our Magical Listing experience, which dramatically reduces this friction for our sellers via AI-generated item descriptions.  We integrated Azure's open AI API into our core listing flow. And now sellers can choose to have detailed product information instantly populated by Generative AI based on the product's title, category and any item aspects that have been input.  During the quarter, we ramped this beta feature to more than 50% of iOS and Android users in the U.S. and expect to reach 100% in the coming weeks. Early signals have been extremely positive. Approximately 30% of users have tried the feature at least once, and we've observed acceptance rates of over 90% for AI-generated descriptions, including those with edits.  Customer satisfaction is over 80% thus far, which is among the highest CSAT for any new feature launched in recent memory. Sellers have told us that this feature will unlock more of the unique inventory in their closets. And on average, we are seeing description lengths double when Gen AI is used.  But we are just getting started. The next iteration of our Magical Listing will leverage our improved image recognition capabilities to provide flows with the option of a more seamless camera-based listing.  Sellers can utilize their smartphone camera or existing photos to start a listing. And based on our visual understanding of the products, the eBay app can pre-populate the title, category, description and item specifics wherever possible. We have been testing this tool with our employees for several weeks, and we're incredibly excited to launch in public beta in the coming months.  The advent of Generative AI has sparked an explosion of creativity at eBay among our product and engineering teams who have conceptualized new and innovative shopping experiences that can be rapidly deployed onto the site. Two compelling examples that launched in July are the Shop by Upgrade and engine code lookup features that went from concept to production in the eBay Motors app in just a few weeks.  Shop by Upgrade uses Generative AI to help customers discover the most relevant fitment-enabled upgrade options for their vehicles, which are personalized based on a specific user's preferences. Engine code lookup offers specific P&A products available on eBay that can address the root cause of hard-to-decipher error codes, aiding them in identifying and fixing the source of the problem.  I'm thrilled to see how quickly our teams are moving with this technology at their disposal and look forward to more of these experiences launching in pilots in the months ahead.  Turning next to our advertising business, which continues to build impressive momentum. We reached a major milestone in Q2 as advertising revenue reached 2% penetration of GMV. Total ads grew 35% while first-party ad revenue grew roughly 50 points faster than GMV. Over 2.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product in Q2, while we reached more than 800 million live promoted listings. Promoted Listings Standard, our CPA product was again the largest contributor to growth in Q2, driven by attribution enhancements, continued optimization and ad rate improvements. At the end of March, we adjusted our attribution methodology for CPA ads, expanding the definition of what constitutes a qualified sale. This change, referred to as a halo attribution in the industry, enabled us to more efficiently optimize our ads as we capture a more complete picture of the downstream sales driven by promoted listings. While sellers maintain the full flexibility to adjust their bidding behavior after this change, halo attribution had a net positive impact on our ad business in Q2.  During the quarter, we also introduced a new way to rank ads on search which leverages our in-house AI capabilities to optimize CPA placements for both conversion and ad rate. Additionally, we improved our precision in calculating trending and suggested ad rates and made it easier to adopt dynamic bidding, both contributed to a modest lift in Q2 ad rate. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also scaled nicely in Q2, growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our CPC product was the largest contributor. Advanced recently exited beta into general release as we have simplified the process of creating and managing campaigns, increased the visibility of CPC ads on eBay and demonstrated healthy return on ad spend levels to sellers.  During Q2, we introduced suggested campaigns for Advanced, which provide a one-click activation experience by offering customized keywords, bid and ad group structures for B2C sellers across 5 major markets. These campaigns were pushed out to sellers on a monthly cadence and can drive further adoption of CPC ads. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. Last quarter, we published our annual impact report, which recognizes the progress we've made to our environmental and social goals. As a pioneer of e-commerce, we are committed to helping sellers earn extra cash selling pre-loved items and helping buyers find items of value while promoting a healthier planet and economy. I'm proud that we continue to make important strides to our own climate goals while leading sustainability throughout our company culture and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, we will soon publish our first ever U.K. social impact report, which takes a closer look at the programs we're delivering for hundreds of underserved entrepreneurs, social enterprises and charities in the U.K. This includes programs like eBay for Change, which supports social entrepreneurs and creates jobs in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Another program with considerable impact is eBay for Charity which raised more than $38 million during the quarter. And I'm excited to announce that Engage for Good, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the practice of cause marketing recognized eBay for Charity as a 2023 charity checkout champion. In closing, I would like to thank our incredible employees for another strong quarter of execution and for continuing to bring our strategic vision to life. I have never been more confident that we are on the right path to unlocking our enormous untapped potential and reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts only at eBay. Our focus on relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovations will greatly benefit our loyal community of sellers and buyers in the quarters and years ahead as well as better cater to the needs of the next generation of online shoppers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. Look, we're excited about the evolution of our strategy here with reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. When you look at the pillars, Eric, first on relevant experiences, we've had a lot of success with this to date, right? Our focus categories have been about creating relevant experiences in specific categories and we've seen a CSAT change, a GMV change, et cetera. And so we're expanding this now to kind of every site-wide experience that we have on the site, including a new design for Gen Z shoppers, including going to every e-mail, every notification. And frankly, new technology and tools enable us to do that. And so we feel really great about that and the impact on customer satisfaction and on GMV. On the scalable solutions, think about all the foundational work that we've done in payments and really being able to take that to the next level with things like financial services and building on that or eBay International Services.  When you combine the scale of eBay in 100 countries with the GMV that we do, we're able to roll out programs like the EIS, eBay International Shipping, and open up that opportunity for our sellers and just drive a lot more cross-border trade and a lot easier experience for our sellers. And then think of magical innovations is really raising the bar on the experience that we're going to have on the site. I talked about some of the new AI products that we're launching. I mean, these are products that are out the gate having over 80% customer satisfaction, having sellers tell us this is going to unlock more inventory because you're making it so easy to list on the platform, products like live commerce. We've now done over 300 live commerce and sellers and buyers are getting really engaged in that. And so that opportunity for us is to drive that customer lifetime value for a buyer as well as attract those new buyers on the platform. What I'm excited by is really the intersection of a couple of these. When you think about the intersection of relevant experiences combined with scalable solutions, only eBay can provide that, and that's why we think we're going to be able to reinvent the future of e-commerce in a really uniquely eBay way. First of all, our strategy when we go back to it in terms of relevant experiences on the site, we're doing a lot of work outside of just the work that we're doing in focus categories. In fact, the majority of our investment is going there. So if you think about the magical listing experience, that's going to help unlock C2C inventory across every category on the site. The second thing I would say is that when you think about our model and what we laid out, we have a real multiplier effect on our buyers. So as we continue to roll out focus categories and as we're seeing success there, that actually helps lift all tides across the eBay marketplace.  So take a sneakers buyer. The average sneaker buyer comes in and buys sneakers over $100, they're going to spend $400 in sneakers but then $2,000 on the rest of the platform outside of that. And that nature really allows us to help grow the overall marketplace, including our non-focus categories.  The last thing I'd say is when you think about things like the scalable solutions that we're building, take eBay international shipping, that's going to help every category. That's going to help focus categories like handbags coming out of Japan, et cetera, but it's also going to help our non-focus categories. And when you think about cross-border trade on the platform, it's really 1 in 5 transactions or 20%. So it you a lot of opportunity, both in our focus category work and the non-focus category work, and we feel committed and confident in our ability to get those to fly in the medium term. Yes. Okay. So first, let me talk about eBay international shipping. So the whole program makes cross-border shipping and selling much easier. So eBay handles the custom forms, we handle the duties. We handle the immediate returns. And sellers are protected from things like item not received claims on the platform. So we're in the process of basically rolling this out. Most sellers are adopting it. And while it's early days for the new program, we're seeing a really positive reception from sellers in terms of shippable listings, the conversion that we're seeing, et cetera.  Why we're excited by it is because 20% of the business on eBay is cross-border, but less than half of our big 3 inventory is available to be shipped internationally. So opening up that inventory, we think, is a unique advantage for eBay and a unique value proposition for our sellers on the marketplace.  When you think about the full funnel marketing that we're doing and that shift, we're really seeing it pay off in terms of our buyer strategy. So this quarter, we saw, once again, new or reactivated buyers was positive for the fourth straight quarter. Our new buyer growth was positive for the second quarter. And take a category like P&A where we've been doing full funnel marketing, really targeting on enthusiasts, there, we're seeing that new and reactivated buyer growth being double digits faster than the rest of the platform. So we feel really good that the investments that we're making are driving the right buyer outcomes. They're exactly where we expect them to be and where I've been talking that they would be. And when you look at it, categories like what we're doing in sneakers. This quarter, we just launched Authenticity Guarantee for streetwear, which is a great kind of Gen Z younger consumer category. We're in the middle of sponsoring fashion island -- sorry, Love Island in the U.K., which is kind of currently on air right now, sponsored by our eBay U.K. business, also bringing in a different type of cohort. So we feel really good that the strategy is working. We're bringing in the enthusiast buyers that we want and that we're seeing a great payoff out of the full funnel marketing approach. Yes. So look, on the first one, clearly, inflation and rising are impacting discretionary demand. I think what makes our platform more resilient is that consumers can come here and find amazing values. So if you think about the refurbished category, which has been a focus category of ours, that grew double digits year-over-year and was the second largest contributor towards our focus category outperformance. In general, on the platform, we're seeing used growing faster than new. And that's what's great about eBay on the buy side. On the sell side, it is also a place to make extra income. And so we're really leaning into what we're doing on a C2C standpoint, including the new Magical Listing rollout because tougher economic times are an opportunity for us to bring more sellers onto the marketplace. When you think about the kind of a lower ASP market or the cross-border trade, as you mentioned, we noted that this quarter, we're actually seeing some strength in the cross-border trade of our business. That has to do with supply chain easing up and there being an opportunity for those sellers to export items in. And so we're actually seeing good health in what we're doing from a cross-border trade business. We've been doing a lot to enable that and make it easier. I talked about eBay international shipping, but we've also been rolling out new capabilities and payments over the past couple of quarters. with buyer and seller FX to make the payments process of that easier.  And we've been working on with some of our sellers to do forward deploying of our inventory which has just helped kind of ease some of that supply chain pressure. So overall, we feel really good about the values that people are getting from this and the initiatives that we're investing in to make it easier for our sellers to export items throughout the globe. Yes. So our first-party ads is really a success based on the execution of the team and what we're seeing in terms of return on ad spend. So this quarter, we grew 49% year-on-year.  Some of that is due to some one-time factors. Steve talked about the accounting change that we've had. We also talked about the halo attribution that we rolled out for sellers. But in general, it's really based on the success of the products and the innovation that we're seeing.  So if you look at our Promoted Listing Standard, it continues to be the workhorse of our advertising portfolio where we're driving more optimization and more relevance. And secondarily, when you look at our new products, they once again grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. They're the -- key one being Promoted Listings in Advanced. And the team continues to innovate to make it easier for sellers. So this quarter, we launched a feature called suggested campaign which makes it easier for sellers to add Promoted Listings Advanced to the work that they're already doing in advertising. And as we talked about, we now have 2.1 million sellers using the product and 800 million listings.  So we feel great about the growth that we're seeing there. As Steve commented, some of that gap will narrow because of some of these onetime factors, but we see revenue continuing to pace out GMV because of the success of what we're doing in ads. Steve, maybe you want to take the second one? Yes. And I'd just add, if you look at Certilogo as an example, it's a perfect acquisition for eBay. They have great relationships with brands. They're driving this ability to have these unique QR codes to make sure that products are authentic, and it's leading into a trend that we're seeing, frankly, two trends. One is the younger Gen Z consumer caring more about sustainability and preloved and what happens with garments. And frankly, governments and regulators, especially in Europe, making sure that products don't go into the landfill, but they get a second and third and fourth life, which drives consistently right into the strategy that we've been talking about as the pioneers of e-commerce and driving the circular economy and driving the benefits for the overall planet. Yes. Look, I think the momentum we're seeing is a reflection of the strategy that we have laid out and seeing it working. So if you think about focus categories, which was our largest one that we've -- we took on P&A, which was our largest one that we've taken on to date, having that grow mid-single digits, the category over $10 billion and be at market rates of growth speaks to the fact that we know how to roll out this playbook and make it successful. And frankly, we're continuing to invest back into categories that we've already launched because of the return that we're seeing. We feel good about things like what we're seeing in refurb with the double-digit growth, et cetera, the success that we're seeing in ads and payments.  So we're really happy with the momentum that we have there. As Steve talked about, we'll kind of deal through the macro pieces. But we're continuing to invest behind the strategy because we feel like it's working and the investments are really paying off for the customer and for shareholders. Operator, can we do one final question, please? Yes. No, Wes, we're seeing good supply from our sellers in that category. I mean if you look overall in the business, supply is in great shape. We did.9 billion listings on the platform. We have over 500 million in P&A. The key for us has really been helping sellers make sense of -- I mean helping buyers make sense of all that inventory.  And as we roll out the new fitment changes, as we've rolled out guaranteed fitment, we're finding that the experience is just so much easier for all of our segments of key buyers, whether they're now using the My Garage feature on the site. We just launched these 2 new AI features which enable us to make the buying experience so much better.  Once we know your car, we can tell you, here's the key upgrades to do. We can help you with things like your engine codes. And look, this is the second quarter of mid-single-digit growth, which we believe is at market rates of growth. And so we're feeling great about that.  As I said, our buyers in P&A are growing double digits faster than the rest of the markets when you look at our new and reactivated buyers. So we're pleased with what we're seeing. We're continuing to invest and roll out new features and new capabilities. We're seeing particular strength in CBT right now. But overall, really pleased with what we're seeing in our motors P&A, and frankly, across our focus category portfolio."

[Operator Instructions] John Egbert, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nJohn Egbert: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for eBay's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jamie Iannone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary during the call, which is available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com. Before we begin, I'll remind you that during this conference call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our accompanying slide presentation. Additionally, all growth rates noted in our prepared remarks will reflect organic FX neutral year-over-year comparisons, unless indicated otherwise. During this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding our future performance and expected financial results. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecast for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and our earnings release from earlier today. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of April 26, 2023. We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our strong performance during the first quarter. We delivered better than expected results across our key financial and operating metrics despite continued challenges in the macro environment. Our emphasis on non-new-in-season goods, advancements of our focused category strategy, site-wide innovation for sellers and buyers and investments in trusted experiences have enhanced the durability of our marketplace and kept us on the path to achieving sustainable long-term growth. We generated over $18.4 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q1, representing a 3 point acceleration in organic year-over-year growth sequentially and over 4% organic growth versus the first quarter of 2019. Revenue eclipsed $2.5 billion and grew 2% organically, outpacing GMV by roughly 5 points, primarily due to contributions from advertising. Our operating margin was 29.6% and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.11, up 5% year-over-year. Our financial results provide clear evidence that our strategy is working and driving underlying growth in our business. Our progress is most evident in focused categories, which outgrew the rest of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1 and grew low-single digits year-over-year overall. Our largest focused category, motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, accelerated a few points sequentially and was the largest contributor to GMV growth in Q1. Based on the data we are seeing, we believe P&A grew at market rates of growth for this category during the quarter, which is a testament to the results that are possible when we are laser focused on driving customer satisfaction and awareness in even the largest categories. In February, we launched the eBay Guaranteed Fit program in the U.S., which enables millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back. We accompanied the launch with a full funnel marketing campaign across TV, streaming video, audio and social channels to drive awareness and consideration of this compelling trust unlock. We're pleased with the initial reception of the Guaranteed Fit program and are excited to extend it to the U.K. and German markets later this year. We also recently began a major revamp of how shoppers buy tires on eBay. We overhauled our tire installation experience on desktop and mobile web in Q4 and expanded the improved experience to mobile apps in Q1. Now buyers can more easily evaluate installation options as they browse and compare tires that fit their vehicle. Across five major markets, buyers can ship tires directly to one of over 10,000 local auto shops for installation rather than having to take delivery of these hard to transport items. While we are still in the early stages of connecting online sales to off-line installations in P&A, these initial launches are already driving a meaningful uplift in the attach rate of installation services to tire purchases. Within our focused categories, our eBay Refurbished program also continues to be a standout. In the current economic climate, our range of refurbished goods has proven to be more valuable than ever and consumers are increasingly aware of the sustainability benefits of purchasing these products. Building off its record holiday quarter, growth in eBay Refurbished GMV accelerated notably during Q1, posting double-digit year-over-year growth. We added dozens of new categories to the program last quarter, including computing and video game peripherals. We also signed up more brands and OEMs in existing categories to sell refurbished inventory directly on eBay. Additionally, in recent months, we've taken steps to make the onboarding process for small business sellers in the eBay Refurbished program faster and more scalable by automating elements of the sign-up and eligibility check processes. This is important because small business sellers make up the majority of refurbished goods sales on eBay and bring some of our most unique and valuable inventory to the platform. Our work to improve the site-wide experience on eBay continued to build momentum in the first quarter. While eBay has operated a core AI platform for years, an upgrade to this platform last year has meaningfully accelerated our AI development philosophy across multiple areas of our organization. In search, we continue to improve retrieval and ranking using state-of-the-art deep learning models and better leveraging the vast amount of structured listing data on our marketplace, which delivers more relevant choices to our buyers. A series of search deployments we made during Q1 led to a measurable uplift in conversion that we estimate would amount to roughly $1 billion in incremental GMV on an annualized basis. This demonstrates the value that a relatively small number of AI-powered enhancements can generate for a marketplace of our scale. Another key area of foundational improvement is our proprietary computer vision technology. With 1.8 billion live listings and billions more images from historical sales, eBay is one of the few companies in the world training deep neural networks using tens of billions of images directly linked to commercially relevant data elements. Leveraging these assets, our product team recently reengineered our visual similarity models, which has dramatically improved the speed and efficacy of image search on eBay. This change has driven more relevant search results and a substantial increase in adoption, image query volume and purchase behavior. It also enables new features like the See Visually Similar results module, we are testing within select subcategories of furniture and home decor. These capabilities are powerful unlocks in helping eBay buyers discover more of the unique and hard to describe items on our marketplace. For example, if you have an antique vase that breaks, you can now just take a picture of the pattern and find an exact match for a potential replacement on eBay. Our advancements in computer vision also have profound implications for the selling experience on eBay. Over the coming quarters, you'll see us testing new experiences, harnessing our improved visual and contextual understanding of product images to assist our sellers in listing products. For instance, sellers will soon be able to pre-populate categories and item specifics from a single photo, enabling them to spend less of their time inputting inventory and more on growing and managing their businesses. eBay is also well positioned to benefit from recent leaps forward in generative AI capabilities. We are in the process of integrating the ChatGPT API into our core listing flow and will soon launch a beta release of a plug-in that enables sellers to automatically generate text for their item description based on known product attributes. Generative AI has a number of exciting use cases outside of descriptions, and we're exploring numerous potential applications across our marketplace that can enable truly magical customer experiences. I'm excited to share more about these initiatives with you over the coming quarters. For store sellers, we recently launched a centralized tool, making it more seamless to publish and promote their listings across social media. This new feature is integrated into the Seller Hub and makes it easier to bulk post across several popular social channels with content that is automatically optimized for each medium, including engaging carousels that allow shoppers to browse multiple listings in a single post. Thousands of store sellers have already linked their social accounts to date, and on average, they observed 40% higher click through rates on content published using this new tool versus what was previously available. Last quarter, we talked to you about the February rollout of our new eBay International Shipping program, which makes it as easy for eBay sellers to ship from Silicon Valley to Sydney as it is to ship to St. Louis. The revamped program is not only making cross-border trade more seamless and cost effective for sellers and buyers, but it also improves trust in eBay's coordination of the end-to-end shipping process. During Q1, we fully ramped this program to sellers in the U.S. and migrated 100% of listings from our previous global shipping program. While its early days for the new program, we're already observing a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Over the long term, we believe eBay International Shipping will increase cross border inventory available to buyers, improve sales velocity and price realization for sellers and ultimately drive incremental GMV. Now transitioning to advertising. Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth at scale despite challenges in the broader digital ad market. Strong demand for Promoted Listings drove first-party advertising revenue of $285 million, up 31% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth for the third straight quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 23% to $317 million. During Q1, over 2 million sellers adopted single ad products, and we reached more than 750 million live Promoted Listings. Our standard CPA product was once again the largest contributor to advertising growth, benefiting from continued optimization and performance improvement. In Q1, we rolled out a new machine learning model for ranking CPA ads that improved sales philosophy for sellers and conversion for buyers. This ranking model also enables us to evaluate the expected performance of multiple ad products alongside each other rather than making ad-serving decisions in silos. This change will be beneficial as we continue to expand our multiproduct advertising portfolio. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also continued to scale and grew mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter during the seasonally slower Q1. This growth was led by Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click format, which benefited from an upgraded relevance model deployed in the quarter as well as the inclusion of CPC ads within more of our existing ad services. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. I'm pleased that we continue to make meaningful progress on our key ESG initiatives. Just yesterday, we published our seventh Annual Diversity Equity and Inclusion report. This report provides insight into our four strategic objectives: increase representation, cultivate a sense of belonging, engage our communities and allies, and build inclusive technology. These objectives help us build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fiercely inclusive place to buy, sell and work. We have seen a steady increase in the number of women and underrepresented minorities in all levels enrolled since 2020, with women representing 42% of our global workforce. I'm also proud to report eBay's gender pay equity is at 100% globally. The next here I would like to highlight is around reducing our impact on the planet. Two years ago, we set ambitious long-term science based targets. In 2022, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 7% versus 2021 and by 32% from our baseline in 2019. We also continue to make progress on our Scope 3 reduction goal. Lastly, 91% of our energy now comes from renewable sources and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs in our annual impact report coming out next month. In addition, we continue to partner with other organizations across the industry to make an even bigger impact on sustainability. Throughout 2022, we partnered with some of our e-commerce peers to encourage the U.S. Postal Service to adopt more innovative and sustainable shipping practices for small businesses. Our efforts culminated in a letter published in February 2023 congratulating USPS for their commitment to exclusively purchasing electric delivery vehicles by 2026. This shift not only helps the environment but also our customers by enabling lower costs and other benefits offered by an all-electric delivery fleet. Turning to eBay for Charity. The eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity, and I'm always impressed by the contributions from this program. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $38 million, up 3% year-over-year. During the quarter, the program continued to support important initiatives like a Black History Month sneaker campaign, highlighting Black sneaker designers and influencers. Additionally, during Q1, the eBay Foundation committed $11 million to non-profit organizations advancing inclusive entrepreneurship. The foundation also supported disaster relief efforts with employee contributions and matching gifts. All of these efforts combined demonstrate our purpose driven community and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. Newsweek recognized eBay for our efforts around diversity in the workplace as well as our customer service. Additionally, eBay was once again included in JUST Capital and CNBC's list of America's Most Just Companies, which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. Lastly, we were ranked among some of the top companies on S&P's Global Sustainability Yearbook, which distinguishes companies for their strengths in corporate sustainability. In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded our quarterly financial commitments while making significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories grew roughly 8 points faster than the rest of our marketplace, led by an acceleration in the P&A category, which reached market rates of growth in Q1. Our core AI platform has dramatically improved our tech velocity, leading to accelerated innovation in areas like search, computer vision, generative AI and advertising. We continue to find more ways to leverage our scale for the benefit of sellers, most recently with our eBay International Shipping program. This initiative is reducing costs, alleviating friction and improving trust for cross border transactions. And ultimately, we believe it will lead to more of our sellers' unique inventory being made available globally. And we continue to make meaningful progress with our pay equity, representation efforts, charitable contributions made through our platform and our impact on the environment. Lastly, I'd like to thank our talented eBay employees who have been relentlessly focused on raising the bar for innovation and service to our customers. I'm also grateful I was able to meet and personally connect with a number of our sellers during my travels last quarter. Hearing their feedback and seeing the impact eBay is having on their businesses is truly inspiring. Our sellers, along with our enthusiast buyers truly make eBay a more vibrant marketplace and community. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the first quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter and some additional thoughts on the second half of the year before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX neutral basis unless I note otherwise. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations despite navigating a challenging macro environment for e-commerce. Gross merchandise volume was down 3% to $18.4 billion, improving 3 points sequentially, while FX was a 3 point headwind to reported year-over-year growth. Revenue was up 2% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points due primarily to continued momentum within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%, down 2.8 points year-over-year due to volume deleverage and continued investment in product innovation and full funnel marketing to support our strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $709 million of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year, while returning $384 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q1 results demonstrate the strength and durability of our scaled global marketplace during periods of economic uncertainty, as well as the meaningful impact our strategic initiatives are having on our long-term growth trajectory. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.4 billion was down 3% year-over-year on an organic FX neutral basis or down 2%, including the impact of recent M&A. Organic GMV growth accelerated by 3 points sequentially in Q1, driven by continued outperformance in focused categories, strong initiative delivery within horizontal areas like search and healthy ROI on our marketing investments. The sequential improvement was also aided by the lapping of last year's macro downturn midway through the first quarter. FX represents the 3 point headwind on to reported year-over-year GMV growth, which is roughly 0.5 point worse than the implied headwind in our Q1 outlook but an improvement of 3 points versus Q4. As noted last quarter, we estimate one-time factors contributed roughly $100 million to GMV in Q1, which we primarily attribute to CBT sellers keeping stores open during the Lunar New Year. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, a trend that is becoming more visible as macro-related pressures subside. Focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1. In aggregate, focused categories delivered positive low-single digit growth in Q1 as our business accelerated overall. Motors, parts, accessories, or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth in our focus categories. P&A GMV accelerated by a few points sequentially in Q1, climbing to what we believe are market rates of growth for this category in our largest markets. P&A momentum has benefited from multiple quarters of product and fitment investments as well as full funnel marketing aimed at raising awareness and consideration among all shoppers. Growth in refurbished goods accelerated a healthy double-digit growth in Q1, meaningfully contributing to our focused category outperformance. In support of our luxury categories, we recently leaned into paid, owned and earned media to grow awareness of our authenticity guarantee program with a particular focus on millennials and Gen Z. Although this campaign has just started, it has already improved perceptions of eBay as a trusted place to shop for high ASP items. Now looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 5% organically in Q1, accelerating by roughly 5 points versus the prior quarter, driven by strength in our focused categories and moderating lapping pressures. Diminishing headwinds to global supply chains and overall strength in cross border trade did favor imports over domestic sales among U.S. buyers in Q1. International GMV declined 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 3 points sequentially, benefiting from robust cross-border trade, particularly within P&A as well as outperformance in our other focused categories. Although key macro indicators like GDP and e-commerce growth remained notably weaker outside of the U.S., business conditions appeared relatively stable quarter-over-quarter internationally. Moving to active buyers. 133 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in March. We had 131 million active buyers, excluding recent M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations last July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down less than 1 million sequentially. We continue to see stabilization in our active buy account driven by buyer reactivation initiatives and particular strength in P&A. In aggregate, new and reactivated buyers showed positive year-over-year growth for the third straight quarter, while new buyer growth was positive for the first time in eight quarters. Enthusiast buyers remained relatively stable sequentially at 16 million in Q1 as migration patterns between buyer groups continued to modestly improve. Enthusiast buyers make up roughly 70% of GMV on eBay and on average, to spend approximately $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. Net revenue of $2.5 billion represented organic FX neutral growth of 2% year-over-year, accelerating by more than 3 points versus Q4. Total FX neutral revenue growth, including M&A was 3%, while currency was a 2 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.6%, down roughly 20 basis points sequentially but up over 80 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency, our take rate would have risen quarter-over-quarter as FX represented a headwind of roughly 35 basis points. In terms of the drivers of take rate, recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping program and aggregate contributed roughly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate in Q1. Managed payments was modestly accretive to our sequential take rate, driven by new financial services. Our ads business continues to deliver impressive results and drive revenue in excess of volume growth. Total advertising revenue grew 23% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 31%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter. This delta was driven by optimization and performance improvements within our standard Promoted Listings product, paired with healthy growth in emerging products like advanced and external Promoted Listings. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6% in Q1, down 2.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly flat year-over-year as modest volume deleverage and roughly 0.5 point of pressure from the rollout of eBay International Shipping were offset by monetization efficiencies. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q1, and we continue investing in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories. Product development rose by 1.3 points as we continue to hire product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation on the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 1 point, driven by M&A, higher employee spend and volume deleverage. We generated $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 9% reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.05, aided by a modest recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 30% to $709 million in Q1 as beneficial working capital items offset lower cash earnings. Our balance sheet position remains robust as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion, following a $1.2 billion debt repayment in January. We repurchased roughly $250 million of shares at an average price of approximately $46 during Q1 and have roughly $2.6 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $134 million in March or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase in value sequentially, driven primarily by the recovery in our Adevinta shares. Moving on to our outlook. For the second quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 2% year-over-year. This outlook anticipates an FX headwind to reported GMV growth of over 0.5 point. We expect to generate revenue between $2.47 billion to $2.54 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between 1% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 26.1% and 26.8%. And we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01, representing EPS growth between negative 3% and positive 2% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our Q2 guidance range implies total FX neutral GMV growth of negative 4% to negative 2%. Given persistent macro challenges around the world, we believe it is prudent to prepare for continued uncertainty. First, we continue to plan our business around the assumption that GMV trends in the second half of 2023 roughly approximate the sequential growth we observed in 2022, excluding the impact of currency, starting from our Q2 spot GMV guidance range. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue, by approximately mid-single digits year-over-year on a spot basis. The majority of this change versus our prior outlook or more than 2 points of the delta is driven by the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar on expenses in foreign currency, which also increases GMV and revenue. The remainder is driven by incremental investments in product and full funnel marketing as we're encouraged by the strong returns on the investments we've seen year-to-date. We continue to expect our take rate to expand organically in 2023, excluding the impact of FX, driven primarily by continued momentum within our advertising business. As we noted last quarter, our expense forecast contemplates one-time impacts from recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping. These one-time factors in aggregate are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind to operating margin of approximately 100 basis points as compared to our 2022 P&L. Notably, we expect the eBay International Shipping program to generate positive operating profit dollars in 2023 and approach our corporate operating margin percentage by Q4. The costs for this program have been in line with expectations to date. And since they are almost entirely variable, they can be passed through to customer facing shipping fees with a predictable margin for eBay. Our expense growth forecast is net of more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program as we look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. With minimal noise from FX, our other income and expense reported in Q1 should be a reasonable baseline for the remaining quarters of 2023. We continue to estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. Lastly, if foreign currencies were to hold at today's rates, FX would represent a de minimis impact to GMV and a 2 point to 3 point headwind for non-GAAP EPS in 2023 as we lap hedging gains from the prior year. In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS amid a dynamic global operating environment for e-commerce. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, while horizontal innovation in areas like search and International Shipping supports our marketplace overall. Our disciplined approach to full funnel marketing has fueled growth in new and reactivated buyers and improved awareness and consideration in focused categories. Advertising growth continues to be robust as first-party ads outpaced GMV by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter due to continued adoption and optimization gains. We generated $709 million of free cash flow, returned $384 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends and reduced our net share count sequentially. And importantly, we continue to develop programs that support our communities, and we are making steady progress towards reducing our impact on the planet. I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on operational excellence, which has enabled us to navigate short-term macro challenges while continuing to drive our business towards sustainable, long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nNikhil Devnani: Great. Thank you both for taking my questions. So I had a couple around expenses and margins. On the 2023 expense outlook, it looks like that's increased from about 2% growth this year to now mid-single digits. Could you maybe provide some more specifics around what's changed in that outlook and where you now expect to spend a little bit more? And then I had a second question on margins that I'll ask after. Thanks.\nStephen Priest: Hi, Nikhil. Steve here. Great to speak to you, and thank you for the question. As you are more than aware, we're not fully guiding the full year at this point due to the uncertainty of the current macro environment. But let me give you a little bit of color with regards to the expense commentary that we shared on the call. Last quarter, when we talked to the markets, we talked about targeting total expense growth for 2023 of approximately 2% increase with onetime factors, as we talked about, like M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping, contributed a significant amount of that year-over-year expense growth. The mid-single digit guide that we provided you with today assumes the current weaker U.S. dollar exchange rate that we've seen continues for the remainder of the year. This FX impact accounts for the majority of the delta versus the prior outlook. And obviously, we will have corresponding positive impact on both GMV and revenue. In addition, the top line performance of the first quarter, we are pleased with the levels of execution that we had during the quarter, is providing us with incremental investment capacity for 2023. And so you're seeing us continue to invest in the business because we're getting such a strong return on investment as we go forward. And this is really aiding towards our drive towards long-term sustainable growth.\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks. And maybe just a big picture one on margins as you look out further. Obviously, there's a lot of important reinvestment happening. Business mix, I think, has also changed between M&A, payments, shipping. But you have some tailwinds into the take rate as well. So when you kind of step back, what is the right long-term structure for this business? I mean, should we still think about it as being a low-30s EBIT margin profile or should we approach it differently now? Thank you.\nStephen Priest: As you can imagine, Nikhil, we haven't guided long-term margins. I think what I would say is I'm very encouraged by the earnings power of eBay, both from ultimately driving improved net earnings and ultimately strong free cash flow coming over the business. The things that we're thinking about as we go in '23, margin will be a function of the underlying GMV momentum, which is ultimately impacted by the macro environment that we operate in. As we\u2019ve talked about, the impact of recent M&A where we\u2019re leaning in on the EIS program, that will drive long-term increases in operating income for eBay will drive about 100 basis points of margin dilution in \u201823. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to continue to lean into the short term and drive operational efficiencies through the structural cost program. And we\u2019re well on track and slightly above the $100 million that we laid out for 2023. That enables us, as I said earlier, to reinvest in the business and drive long-term sustainable growth for eBay.\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions and hope everyone on the team is well. I wanted to come back to the comments you made on the focused category marketing spend, and maybe just a multi-parter on that one theme. Can you give us some greater level of granularity of what avenues of deploying those marketing spends are delivering sort of higher versus lower ROIs? And how should we be thinking about how that spend might evolve in the years ahead and when measuring that spend and trying to look at it from the outside in, what do you think we should be monitoring the most to qualify the sort of return on that spend? Is it enthusiast buyer growth? Is it enthusiast buyer behavior? How should we be thinking about what the return on that spend will be over a multiyear time frame? Thanks so much.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Look, the first thing I'd point to, Eric is the 8-point outperformance of focused categories over the rest of the business. In these areas where we're investing in, we're seeing the right types of growth. When I look at a category like P&A, which is our largest full funnel marketing to date, you look at the results this quarter, where we're at market rates of growth and we're really excited by what we're seeing there. I think enthusiast buyers as well in the quarter and active buyers were strong. For the third straight quarter, we had an aggregate new and reactivated buyers growing positively. And our new buyer growth was positive for the first time in eight quarters. And let me give you an example of how that ties into marketing. So in P&A, where we've had this large full funnel marketing campaign, new and reactivated buyers actually grew double-digits faster than the overall marketplace during the quarter. So this has been a shift for us that we\u2019ve been talking about all along, which is moving from just lower funnel optimization to more full funnel, driving long-term consideration, which takes a little bit of time. But the results that we\u2019re seeing off of that spend are great and are creating a really healthy business as evidenced by what we\u2019re seeing in the focused category outperformance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nWesley Sanford: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. This is Wes on for Doug. Maybe one for Steve and one for Jamie. I think the gross margins were a little bit of a bigger headwind sequentially this quarter than we were thinking on the EIS rollout. Did you roll it out faster than you had originally anticipated and how should we think about gross margins as we go through the rest of the year? And then maybe one for Jamie a little separately but had been talking a lot around eBay Live and kind of what you're doing in the collectible space. So was just hoping to learn a little bit more about what -- how you're looking to go after the category beyond trading cards and comics looking ahead. Thanks.\nStephen Priest: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Steve here. I'll pick up the first question. EIS is -- we fully ramped the program for the existing sellers on our global buying hub this quarter. And we're obviously at the very early stage of the global ramp. In terms of your specific question around gross margins, they are exactly in line with what we'd expected about a 50 basis point impact on gross margin in the quarter. The great thing about this program as you go forward, although it has an impact on gross margins because of the way that we account for EIS, it generates good bottom line momentum for eBay and it's strategically important, and it also gives us the ability to dial up our charges depending on what the costs we incur for the International Shipping. On a longer-term basis, we expect this program to be accretive to overall profit for the year. And at the end of the year, as we get to the fourth quarter, it will approach our core margin structure for the overall business.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. And then on live commerce, this is something we began experimenting with Q2 of last year, hosting a few pilots and experimenting with it throughout Q2. We did expand it into luxury in Q4 with some events for handbags and jewelry. We also created a central hub and discovery entry point for our live commerce events in Q4, which means now users can subscribe to a specific channel or receive updates and notifications of upcoming events. This year, we hosted about 15 eBay Live events with over $500,000 of in-event GMV across collectibles and luxuries. And at the end of March, we started hosting our first short auctions, think like 30 seconds for handbags and collectibles. In general, these are getting 5,000 and 15,000 buyers. We're seeing great engagement from that standpoint so we're going to continue to pilot and learn and experiment with this technology, but exciting initial results thus far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Morton: Thank you. Thank you for the question. I was wondering if we could maybe dig a little bit deeper on the spend buckets you're clearly investing in the business and the returns you're seeing there. And also how it could be feeding into the improvement and the decline rate for active buyers? And any color you could give us on the buyer level maybe inflecting, starting to grow going forward? And then just the second question is, there's this macro environment we're all living in. Any changes in behavior you're seeing around your luxury products, trade down, new buyers coming who might have purchased new? Anything around that would be great. Thank you.\nStephen Priest: Mike, Steve here. Thank you for the question, Michael. I'll kick off with the first one and then Jamie can pick up the second one, perhaps. Specifically with regards to where the investments are going, as you would expect, it's in terms of identifying what customers want and building the products that delight them and turning them about then to our full funnel approach to marketing. And so the investments that we're taking forward is really developing tremendous products on eBay. In the last couple of years, we've really pivoted our marketing spend to full funnel. And you've seen the fruits of our labor. Think about Jamie's prepared comments around the fact that we're growing at market rates in parts and accessories. We're seeing high double-digit growth with regards to refurbished business for the second quarter on the balance as a result of the investments that we're making. There's obviously a good correlation between our enthusiast buyers and the focused categories that we're going forward with in terms of our frequency coming to eBay and the levels of spend going forward. But what we're delighted with in terms of, again, what we're seeing with the buyers is the reactivation of our NORBs or new or reactivated buyers as we call them at eBay, where they're coming back to our platform as a result of the investments that we're making. Jamie, perhaps you pick up on the luxury question.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Just in general, our luxury and fashion focused categories and on aggregate accelerated in line with our business overall. We continue to expand brand coverage on the platform, et cetera. So think about kind of very similar to what I said last quarter, which is some, a little bit of ASP pressure really made up for by the volume that we\u2019re seeing on the platform. In general, our shift to non-new-in-season and that focus has really helped us in this environment because people are looking for values. And the ones that they can get on our platform make us much more resilient from that standpoint.\nMichael Morton: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So first on EIS, we understand the accounting implications on margins, but can you elaborate on what's driving the profitability improvement from this program over the next few quarters? How do you think about kind of the long-term investments that's required to support this initiative? And then wanted to go back to the focused categories. It was nice to see that nicely outperform the total growth. But can you provide some color maybe on certain categories kind of on a same-store sales basis so that we can see how some of the categories where you launched these initiatives earlier or currently trending maybe like sneakers, handbags, luxury watches and so on? And then how should we sort of think about the sustainability of the strength in P&A for the next few quarters? Thank you so much.\nStephen Priest: No problem, Deepak. So in terms of eBay International Shipping, both got really great strategic benefits but also good sort of financial benefits. So if I take a step back, think about our cross-border trade, which accounts for about 20% of the sales that take place on eBay. And as we came into the eBay International Shipping program, only about 50% of our 1.8 billion listings on the platform are available for global trade. And so we looked through the lens of how do we increase the level of inventory to the global buyers on eBay? And eBay international Shipping certainly facilitates that. The beauty of the program is that we have gone from an agent to a principal. It gives us much greater control over the overall process. So it enables us to drive greater levels of trust, particularly for our sellers. It enables us, with the size and scale of eBay, to leverage much better contracts in terms of the shippers. And it also enables us to pass through any increases in cost through to the shipping program and the sales that go forward. And so as you said, there's an accounting change because of the agent to principal relationship where we recognize both the gross revenue and the cost. And previously, it was net revenue. But as we said in our prepared comments, it's a good -- it provides good earnings dollars growth for eBay, and we would expect by the fourth quarter for it to mirror the margin profile of the wider business at that point. Jamie, over to you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Just on focused categories, I'd say a couple of things. One is, overall, focused categories outperformed the rest of the business by 8 percentage points, so we're definitely seeing the impact of the strategy. A couple of standouts is one, we've already talked about it, but motors, parts and accessories hitting market rates of growth for us was really happening kind of sooner than we thought. I talked about luxury already kind of being a stable growth vector for us. And then maybe the other one I'd highlight for you is just refurbished. Our Refurbished business grew double digits in the quarter. That's really coming off of a healthy Q4 where we had our largest week ever with Refurbished and Cyber. And I think that's two-fold. One is the value proposition that we provide in that focused category is pretty compelling. And two is we're continuing to invest in bringing new brands, making the process easier for small businesses to come on with their refurbished products and we're backing it up with a great trust guarantee. On parts and accessories, I'd just say that we actually feel really good about the growth rates that we're seeing there, probably happening even sooner than we thought. We just launched Guaranteed Fit a few months ago. And I've always said these things take a couple of quarters to really have the impact on the consumer in really kind of changing the trust equation, but we're seeing a lot of great movement from that perspective already. So I talked about the buyers on the platform in P&A, New and reactivated buyers in that category are growing double digits faster than the overall marketplace. So it makes me really excited for the future of what we're going to do in P&A. And just like in other categories, we're not done investing. We'll continue to roll out new innovations that are really relevant for that parts and accessory buyer on eBay.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Young with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. First, just dovetailing on one of the earlier questions on luxury. Just bigger picture, what are like the two or three things that might bring luxe buyers and sellers to eBay versus some of the smaller competitor platforms that are focused on that category? Just trying to understand like what helps eBay win. And then on a different category, home and garden, I think it's still 1 of the top five on the platform but hasn't really migrated into focused. Is that an opportunity over the next two to three years to maybe carve out some pockets within, therefore some more curated selection and unique inventory or is that just too broad of a category to really drive those enthusiast buyers?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So I'd say just first on the benefits of eBay, one is the scale. So when products coming to luxury on eBay, they're available in 190 different markets around the world with 130 million plus buyers from that standpoint. So that's a massive advantage. Now that we have authenticity guarantee across our handbags, it basically takes trust off of the table and makes eBay an amazing destination to buy those items. The third thing I'd say is, we have really competitive fees from that standpoint. So if you're looking to sell those products, it's very attractive. I was talking to one of our sellers in handbags who did a live commerce event with us this past quarter and was just really excited by the results and the buyer demand that we were able to bring to something like that. The other unique benefit that we have on eBay is across categories. So we're bringing in buyers not just from handbag buyers but buyers across other categories on the platform and bringing them into handbags. So for our business, the average handbag buyer who buys a handbag over $500, they're going to spend $2,600 in handbags, but then they're going to end up spending $5,600 in other categories in the platform, and that's a really unique advantage for us on the platform. In terms of your questions on home and garden, I'd go back to what I said at Investor Day, which is we have five categories that are over 10 billion, home and garden being one of them, fashion being another, P&A. And so P&A was the largest one we've taken on to date and we've seen really good results. And I've said that every focused category -- I mean, every category that we have, we believe that we can apply the playbook to over time on the platform. So we don't like to get ahead of announcing where we're going for competitive reasons. But we believe this playbook and, in fact, is what we're seeing in P&A is applicable to even our largest categories.\nTrevor Young: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Schenk with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nLauren Schenk: Great. Thanks. And two, if I can. Just one on the expense side. Is there a way that you could help us think about what percentage of your expense base is not denominated in U.S. dollars? I just thought it would be a relatively small portion. And then secondly, it's encouraging to see that new and reactivated customer growth is up. But just given the slight decline in buyers, I mean, consistent with last quarter, does that imply churn? Is that as well? And if so, is that isolated in any specific categories? Thanks very much.\nStephen Priest: Hi, Lauren. I'll pick up the first point. We don't disclose the mix of our sort of currencies. I'd refer you to the overall shape of the business from a global perspective and think about the fact that roughly half of our overall business is generated out of International and half out of the U.S. But we don't specifically disclose the dynamics of that. We obviously talk about the impacts of currency on the overall business, which you can probably triangulate back into. Jamie, go to the question.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Lauren, I would say our active buyer count is exactly where we expected it to be. I\u2019ve been talking for several quarters about some near-term pressure that we thought we would see based on the macro environment, but that I thought we would see stabilization in the metric, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing here is that we\u2019re acquiring buyers in the right way now. We\u2019re building and turning them into enthusiast buyers, and our enthusiast buyers are buying 70% of the GMV on the platform. And so we\u2019re excited that we saw kind of a more modest change in stabilization. And the P&A stats that I talked about with buyers is also really encouraging because it shows when we invest, we\u2019re actually seeing what we want to see with new and reactivated buyers on the platform. So as things change from that standpoint, we\u2019ll continue to update you, but we actually feel really great about what\u2019s happening on the buying side.\nLauren Schenk: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. So I think you talked about the case for International Shipping to be a profit center by the end of the year. But on the other hand, there are a lot of companies out there that use shipping savings as a promotional tool. So do you think there are opportunities for you to underwrite some of these costs to do the same or maybe come up with tools to aid the seller to run shipping discounts as an incremental way to promote their listings on eBay? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Look, we've always considered shipping as variable, so we can pass through those expenses to the seller from that standpoint. What we give them is the benefits of scale. So when you look at eBay's scale advantages in being able to work with providers from that standpoint and being able to manage things efficiently. When you buy your label through eBay as an example, you're getting a very good discount versus what you would pay if you just walked in and tried to do those shipments on your own. And so we're going to continue to bring our scale to benefits like this. This one is really about opening up that inventory. So we wanted to almost be invisible to the seller based in the geography that they're shipping internationally. So the example I talked about is, if I'm sitting in Manhattan, I can ship a product that's actually going to Spain, but it will feel like I'm shipping a product to Albany because we take care of everything in the background. So it's really about that 20% of GMV that we do in cross-border. As Steve said, less than half of our inventory is available to go across borders. And this is really about creating that unlock. And it's, frankly, one of the powerful weapons of eBay is because as even a casual seller on the platform, we open up such massive worldwide scale demand for you in 190 different countries. So think about the EIS kind of similar to ads or payments. It's us leveraging our scale for the benefit of our sellers.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. One on the macro, maybe one on ads if I could. So I guess how, if at all, have you seen consumer patterns shift in the wake of the recent banking crisis? And if there's been any sort of different reaction either more or less pronounced in the U.S. versus international markets, that would be helpful. And then maybe on the advertising side of the business. Jim, you talked about growing the number of services in which you were able to place CPC ads as a driver of Promoted Listings Advanced in the quarter. When you think about the path forward from here, how far are you into the journey, would you say, in terms of rolling out CPC-enabled ads across the entire eBay platform? I guess said differently, how much more runway do you see for CPC-enabled ad load growth from here?\nStephen Priest: Hi, Lee. I'll pick up the macro question. Obviously, we've extensively talked about the impacts of macro on our first quarter earnings, the perspectives of the guide for the second. We haven't seen any discernible change in the underlying dynamic macro environment. From a geographical perspective, as you recall, as we came into the end of the first quarter last year and the awful events of the war in Ukraine, and Europe started to get impacted sooner than the U.S., particularly because of energy prices and the levels of consumer discretionary spend pressure. Obviously, that's caused some differential in the lapping behaviors. We've gone through and start to go through 2023. But no underlying discernible change in the overall macro environment.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. And Lee, what I'd say on the PL Advanced or our CPC-based business is, in Q1, we updated our [indiscernible] model, training it on CPC-specific data. That helped us present higher quality impressions and more GMV for the same number of impressions on the site. We also expanded CPC to the second row of ad placements within search results, which was previously only available to CPA. So it's still early in our CPC development. We're excited about these innovations. We also built some new technologies this quarter that helped us do better real-time evaluation between CPA and CPC. But what I would say is that we're well on track to the numbers that we outlined at Investor Day. And we think a big component of that in terms of new products is the Product Listings Advanced product and happy with the continued innovation quarter-after-quarter to kind of drive towards those targets.\nJohn Egbert: Operator, can we do one last question, please?\nOperator: Certainly, your last question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One more on the advertising side and then maybe I'll just ask about buybacks. So advertising is coming in really nicely ahead of GMV. It looks like it's accelerated nicely ahead of our expectations. And obviously, we've got the legacy products and some of the newer products coming on. But has your outlook on the opportunity changed? Is it being pulled forward to a certain extent, maybe the macro environment leading to more sellers spending more on advertising to try to drive sales? So any incremental color on kind of what's moving the needle there? And then just on buybacks, expectations or use for the rest of the year, how you guys are thinking about it? Just any other color there.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Look, advertising once again outpaced volume by 33 percentage points, driven by what we're doing in optimizing product listings across both standard and our more advanced products. We continue to think we have a long runway ahead of us for advertising. And I'd point to a couple of things. One is, we continue to see nice quarter-over-quarter growth in our new advertising products, that's External Express and Promoted Listings Advanced. The second thing I'd say is that we have a variable model where sellers can set their rates. And we're seeing really good ROAS for our sellers. So when we look at the return on ad spend that they're seeing, once they start using our ad products, their sales are basically seeing a double-digit increase. And more importantly, when you look at the ROAS that they can get on eBay, it's very attractive relative to industry standards. So as I said before, we feel like we're on track and executing towards the goals that we laid out. We feel like we're doing a nice job of balancing the buying experience and keeping that incredibly healthy and strong conversion while continuing to drive our ads business. And finally, we're just making the product easier to use. So quarter-after-quarter, we've built new products. Most recently, we've built a quick setup, a product for our CPC-based product to make that easier to use. And we continue to build up new reporting tools for our advertising sellers. So we're excited by where we are and the potential that's ahead. Steve, do you want to take the next part?\nStephen Priest: Yeah. Hi, Ygal. What I would say is that our first priority, as we always say is to invest in the long-term growth of the business through our build, buy, partner framework and because we see that as the best opportunities to drive long-term returns for shareholders. The beauty of the eBay model is because of the strength of the financial model and the strong free cash flow that we [indiscernible] gives us the ability to do both in terms of investing in the business and return capital. As you know, we returned $250 million to investors through buybacks in the first quarter in addition to the $0.25 dividend. We haven't guided our capital returns for the rest of the year, but we will continue to be balanced and thoughtful about the approach. We have committed to offset dilution and we'll continue to do that through the year. And then beyond that, we'll be opportunistic in both the timing and magnitude of any further capital returns.\nYgal Arounian: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights from the first quarter on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll walk through our key operating and financial metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter and some additional thoughts on the second half of the year before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX neutral basis unless I note otherwise. Overall, I am pleased with our Q1 results as our key financial metrics exceeded expectations despite navigating a challenging macro environment for e-commerce. Gross merchandise volume was down 3% to $18.4 billion, improving 3 points sequentially, while FX was a 3 point headwind to reported year-over-year growth. Revenue was up 2% to approximately $2.5 billion, which outpaced volume by 5 points due primarily to continued momentum within our advertising business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%, down 2.8 points year-over-year due to volume deleverage and continued investment in product innovation and full funnel marketing to support our strategic initiatives. We delivered $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 5% year-over-year. And we generated $709 million of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year, while returning $384 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our Q1 results demonstrate the strength and durability of our scaled global marketplace during periods of economic uncertainty, as well as the meaningful impact our strategic initiatives are having on our long-term growth trajectory. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.4 billion was down 3% year-over-year on an organic FX neutral basis or down 2%, including the impact of recent M&A. Organic GMV growth accelerated by 3 points sequentially in Q1, driven by continued outperformance in focused categories, strong initiative delivery within horizontal areas like search and healthy ROI on our marketing investments. The sequential improvement was also aided by the lapping of last year's macro downturn midway through the first quarter. FX represents the 3 point headwind on to reported year-over-year GMV growth, which is roughly 0.5 point worse than the implied headwind in our Q1 outlook but an improvement of 3 points versus Q4. As noted last quarter, we estimate one-time factors contributed roughly $100 million to GMV in Q1, which we primarily attribute to CBT sellers keeping stores open during the Lunar New Year. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, a trend that is becoming more visible as macro-related pressures subside. Focused categories outgrew the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1. In aggregate, focused categories delivered positive low-single digit growth in Q1 as our business accelerated overall. Motors, parts, accessories, or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth in our focus categories. P&A GMV accelerated by a few points sequentially in Q1, climbing to what we believe are market rates of growth for this category in our largest markets. P&A momentum has benefited from multiple quarters of product and fitment investments as well as full funnel marketing aimed at raising awareness and consideration among all shoppers. Growth in refurbished goods accelerated a healthy double-digit growth in Q1, meaningfully contributing to our focused category outperformance. In support of our luxury categories, we recently leaned into paid, owned and earned media to grow awareness of our authenticity guarantee program with a particular focus on millennials and Gen Z. Although this campaign has just started, it has already improved perceptions of eBay as a trusted place to shop for high ASP items. Now looking at our business on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 5% organically in Q1, accelerating by roughly 5 points versus the prior quarter, driven by strength in our focused categories and moderating lapping pressures. Diminishing headwinds to global supply chains and overall strength in cross border trade did favor imports over domestic sales among U.S. buyers in Q1. International GMV declined 1% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating by roughly 3 points sequentially, benefiting from robust cross-border trade, particularly within P&A as well as outperformance in our other focused categories. Although key macro indicators like GDP and e-commerce growth remained notably weaker outside of the U.S., business conditions appeared relatively stable quarter-over-quarter internationally. Moving to active buyers. 133 million active buyers shopped on eBay during the trailing 12 months ending in March. We had 131 million active buyers, excluding recent M&A and buyers from our Turkey business, where we ceased operations last July. Excluding these impacts, active buyers were down less than 1 million sequentially. We continue to see stabilization in our active buy account driven by buyer reactivation initiatives and particular strength in P&A. In aggregate, new and reactivated buyers showed positive year-over-year growth for the third straight quarter, while new buyer growth was positive for the first time in eight quarters. Enthusiast buyers remained relatively stable sequentially at 16 million in Q1 as migration patterns between buyer groups continued to modestly improve. Enthusiast buyers make up roughly 70% of GMV on eBay and on average, to spend approximately $3,000 annually. Turning to revenue. Net revenue of $2.5 billion represented organic FX neutral growth of 2% year-over-year, accelerating by more than 3 points versus Q4. Total FX neutral revenue growth, including M&A was 3%, while currency was a 2 point headwind to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.6%, down roughly 20 basis points sequentially but up over 80 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency, our take rate would have risen quarter-over-quarter as FX represented a headwind of roughly 35 basis points. In terms of the drivers of take rate, recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping program and aggregate contributed roughly 10 basis points to our sequential take rate in Q1. Managed payments was modestly accretive to our sequential take rate, driven by new financial services. Our ads business continues to deliver impressive results and drive revenue in excess of volume growth. Total advertising revenue grew 23% during the quarter, while first-party ads grew 31%, outpacing volume by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter. This delta was driven by optimization and performance improvements within our standard Promoted Listings product, paired with healthy growth in emerging products like advanced and external Promoted Listings. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6% in Q1, down 2.8 points year-over-year. Gross margins were roughly flat year-over-year as modest volume deleverage and roughly 0.5 point of pressure from the rollout of eBay International Shipping were offset by monetization efficiencies. Sales and marketing rose by over 1 point as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q1, and we continue investing in full funnel marketing to support our focused categories. Product development rose by 1.3 points as we continue to hire product and engineering talent to accelerate innovation on the platform. Our G&A expense rose by roughly 1 point, driven by M&A, higher employee spend and volume deleverage. We generated $1.11 of non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1, up 5% year-over-year, benefiting from a 9% reduction in share count from our repurchases. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.05, aided by a modest recovery in our equity investment portfolio. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Free cash flow grew 30% to $709 million in Q1 as beneficial working capital items offset lower cash earnings. Our balance sheet position remains robust as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion, following a $1.2 billion debt repayment in January. We repurchased roughly $250 million of shares at an average price of approximately $46 during Q1 and have roughly $2.6 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $134 million in March or $0.25 per share. Our investment portfolio is detailed on Slide 19 of our earnings presentation. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase in value sequentially, driven primarily by the recovery in our Adevinta shares. Moving on to our outlook. For the second quarter, we forecast GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between negative 5% and negative 2% year-over-year. This outlook anticipates an FX headwind to reported GMV growth of over 0.5 point. We expect to generate revenue between $2.47 billion to $2.54 billion, representing organic FX neutral growth between 1% and 4% year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP operating margin to fall between 26.1% and 26.8%. And we forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.96 and $1.01, representing EPS growth between negative 3% and positive 2% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our Q2 guidance range implies total FX neutral GMV growth of negative 4% to negative 2%. Given persistent macro challenges around the world, we believe it is prudent to prepare for continued uncertainty. First, we continue to plan our business around the assumption that GMV trends in the second half of 2023 roughly approximate the sequential growth we observed in 2022, excluding the impact of currency, starting from our Q2 spot GMV guidance range. For the full year, we expect to grow total non-GAAP expenses, inclusive of cost of revenue, by approximately mid-single digits year-over-year on a spot basis. The majority of this change versus our prior outlook or more than 2 points of the delta is driven by the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar on expenses in foreign currency, which also increases GMV and revenue. The remainder is driven by incremental investments in product and full funnel marketing as we're encouraged by the strong returns on the investments we've seen year-to-date. We continue to expect our take rate to expand organically in 2023, excluding the impact of FX, driven primarily by continued momentum within our advertising business. As we noted last quarter, our expense forecast contemplates one-time impacts from recent M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping. These one-time factors in aggregate are expected to represent a year-over-year headwind to operating margin of approximately 100 basis points as compared to our 2022 P&L. Notably, we expect the eBay International Shipping program to generate positive operating profit dollars in 2023 and approach our corporate operating margin percentage by Q4. The costs for this program have been in line with expectations to date. And since they are almost entirely variable, they can be passed through to customer facing shipping fees with a predictable margin for eBay. Our expense growth forecast is net of more than $100 million of OpEx savings from our structured cost program as we look inward for cost efficiencies in our business. With minimal noise from FX, our other income and expense reported in Q1 should be a reasonable baseline for the remaining quarters of 2023. We continue to estimate our non-GAAP tax rate will remain at 16.5% throughout 2023. Lastly, if foreign currencies were to hold at today's rates, FX would represent a de minimis impact to GMV and a 2 point to 3 point headwind for non-GAAP EPS in 2023 as we lap hedging gains from the prior year. In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded expectations for GMV, revenue and EPS amid a dynamic global operating environment for e-commerce. Our focused categories continue to drive underlying growth in our business, while horizontal innovation in areas like search and International Shipping supports our marketplace overall. Our disciplined approach to full funnel marketing has fueled growth in new and reactivated buyers and improved awareness and consideration in focused categories. Advertising growth continues to be robust as first-party ads outpaced GMV by more than 30 points for the third straight quarter due to continued adoption and optimization gains. We generated $709 million of free cash flow, returned $384 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends and reduced our net share count sequentially. And importantly, we continue to develop programs that support our communities, and we are making steady progress towards reducing our impact on the planet. I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on operational excellence, which has enabled us to navigate short-term macro challenges while continuing to drive our business towards sustainable, long-term growth. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Hi, Nikhil. Steve here. Great to speak to you, and thank you for the question. As you are more than aware, we're not fully guiding the full year at this point due to the uncertainty of the current macro environment. But let me give you a little bit of color with regards to the expense commentary that we shared on the call. Last quarter, when we talked to the markets, we talked about targeting total expense growth for 2023 of approximately 2% increase with onetime factors, as we talked about, like M&A and the rollout of eBay International Shipping, contributed a significant amount of that year-over-year expense growth. The mid-single digit guide that we provided you with today assumes the current weaker U.S. dollar exchange rate that we've seen continues for the remainder of the year. This FX impact accounts for the majority of the delta versus the prior outlook. And obviously, we will have corresponding positive impact on both GMV and revenue. In addition, the top line performance of the first quarter, we are pleased with the levels of execution that we had during the quarter, is providing us with incremental investment capacity for 2023. And so you're seeing us continue to invest in the business because we're getting such a strong return on investment as we go forward. And this is really aiding towards our drive towards long-term sustainable growth. As you can imagine, Nikhil, we haven't guided long-term margins. I think what I would say is I'm very encouraged by the earnings power of eBay, both from ultimately driving improved net earnings and ultimately strong free cash flow coming over the business. The things that we're thinking about as we go in '23, margin will be a function of the underlying GMV momentum, which is ultimately impacted by the macro environment that we operate in. As we've talked about, the impact of recent M&A where we're leaning in on the EIS program, that will drive long-term increases in operating income for eBay will drive about 100 basis points of margin dilution in \u201823. And as we've said, we're going to continue to lean into the short term and drive operational efficiencies through the structural cost program. And we're well on track and slightly above the $100 million that we laid out for 2023. That enables us, as I said earlier, to reinvest in the business and drive long-term sustainable growth for eBay. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Steve here. I'll pick up the first question. EIS is -- we fully ramped the program for the existing sellers on our global buying hub this quarter. And we're obviously at the very early stage of the global ramp. In terms of your specific question around gross margins, they are exactly in line with what we'd expected about a 50 basis point impact on gross margin in the quarter. The great thing about this program as you go forward, although it has an impact on gross margins because of the way that we account for EIS, it generates good bottom line momentum for eBay and it's strategically important, and it also gives us the ability to dial up our charges depending on what the costs we incur for the International Shipping. On a longer-term basis, we expect this program to be accretive to overall profit for the year. And at the end of the year, as we get to the fourth quarter, it will approach our core margin structure for the overall business. Mike, Steve here. Thank you for the question, Michael. I'll kick off with the first one and then Jamie can pick up the second one, perhaps. Specifically with regards to where the investments are going, as you would expect, it's in terms of identifying what customers want and building the products that delight them and turning them about then to our full funnel approach to marketing. And so the investments that we're taking forward is really developing tremendous products on eBay. In the last couple of years, we've really pivoted our marketing spend to full funnel. And you've seen the fruits of our labor. Think about Jamie's prepared comments around the fact that we're growing at market rates in parts and accessories. We're seeing high double-digit growth with regards to refurbished business for the second quarter on the balance as a result of the investments that we're making. There's obviously a good correlation between our enthusiast buyers and the focused categories that we're going forward with in terms of our frequency coming to eBay and the levels of spend going forward. But what we're delighted with in terms of, again, what we're seeing with the buyers is the reactivation of our NORBs or new or reactivated buyers as we call them at eBay, where they're coming back to our platform as a result of the investments that we're making. Jamie, perhaps you pick up on the luxury question. No problem, Deepak. So in terms of eBay International Shipping, both got really great strategic benefits but also good sort of financial benefits. So if I take a step back, think about our cross-border trade, which accounts for about 20% of the sales that take place on eBay. And as we came into the eBay International Shipping program, only about 50% of our 1.8 billion listings on the platform are available for global trade. And so we looked through the lens of how do we increase the level of inventory to the global buyers on eBay? And eBay international Shipping certainly facilitates that. The beauty of the program is that we have gone from an agent to a principal. It gives us much greater control over the overall process. So it enables us to drive greater levels of trust, particularly for our sellers. It enables us, with the size and scale of eBay, to leverage much better contracts in terms of the shippers. And it also enables us to pass through any increases in cost through to the shipping program and the sales that go forward. And so as you said, there's an accounting change because of the agent to principal relationship where we recognize both the gross revenue and the cost. And previously, it was net revenue. But as we said in our prepared comments, it's a good -- it provides good earnings dollars growth for eBay, and we would expect by the fourth quarter for it to mirror the margin profile of the wider business at that point. Jamie, over to you. Hi, Lauren. I'll pick up the first point. We don't disclose the mix of our sort of currencies. I'd refer you to the overall shape of the business from a global perspective and think about the fact that roughly half of our overall business is generated out of International and half out of the U.S. But we don't specifically disclose the dynamics of that. We obviously talk about the impacts of currency on the overall business, which you can probably triangulate back into. Jamie, go to the question. Hi, Lee. I'll pick up the macro question. Obviously, we've extensively talked about the impacts of macro on our first quarter earnings, the perspectives of the guide for the second. We haven't seen any discernible change in the underlying dynamic macro environment. From a geographical perspective, as you recall, as we came into the end of the first quarter last year and the awful events of the war in Ukraine, and Europe started to get impacted sooner than the U.S., particularly because of energy prices and the levels of consumer discretionary spend pressure. Obviously, that's caused some differential in the lapping behaviors. We've gone through and start to go through 2023. But no underlying discernible change in the overall macro environment. Yeah. Hi, Ygal. What I would say is that our first priority, as we always say is to invest in the long-term growth of the business through our build, buy, partner framework and because we see that as the best opportunities to drive long-term returns for shareholders. The beauty of the eBay model is because of the strength of the financial model and the strong free cash flow that we [indiscernible] gives us the ability to do both in terms of investing in the business and return capital. As you know, we returned $250 million to investors through buybacks in the first quarter in addition to the $0.25 dividend. We haven't guided our capital returns for the rest of the year, but we will continue to be balanced and thoughtful about the approach. We have committed to offset dilution and we'll continue to do that through the year. And then beyond that, we'll be opportunistic in both the timing and magnitude of any further capital returns."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our strong performance during the first quarter. We delivered better than expected results across our key financial and operating metrics despite continued challenges in the macro environment. Our emphasis on non-new-in-season goods, advancements of our focused category strategy, site-wide innovation for sellers and buyers and investments in trusted experiences have enhanced the durability of our marketplace and kept us on the path to achieving sustainable long-term growth. We generated over $18.4 billion of gross merchandise volume in Q1, representing a 3 point acceleration in organic year-over-year growth sequentially and over 4% organic growth versus the first quarter of 2019. Revenue eclipsed $2.5 billion and grew 2% organically, outpacing GMV by roughly 5 points, primarily due to contributions from advertising. Our operating margin was 29.6% and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.11, up 5% year-over-year. Our financial results provide clear evidence that our strategy is working and driving underlying growth in our business. Our progress is most evident in focused categories, which outgrew the rest of our marketplace by roughly 8 points during Q1 and grew low-single digits year-over-year overall. Our largest focused category, motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, accelerated a few points sequentially and was the largest contributor to GMV growth in Q1. Based on the data we are seeing, we believe P&A grew at market rates of growth for this category during the quarter, which is a testament to the results that are possible when we are laser focused on driving customer satisfaction and awareness in even the largest categories. In February, we launched the eBay Guaranteed Fit program in the U.S., which enables millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back. We accompanied the launch with a full funnel marketing campaign across TV, streaming video, audio and social channels to drive awareness and consideration of this compelling trust unlock. We're pleased with the initial reception of the Guaranteed Fit program and are excited to extend it to the U.K. and German markets later this year. We also recently began a major revamp of how shoppers buy tires on eBay. We overhauled our tire installation experience on desktop and mobile web in Q4 and expanded the improved experience to mobile apps in Q1. Now buyers can more easily evaluate installation options as they browse and compare tires that fit their vehicle. Across five major markets, buyers can ship tires directly to one of over 10,000 local auto shops for installation rather than having to take delivery of these hard to transport items. While we are still in the early stages of connecting online sales to off-line installations in P&A, these initial launches are already driving a meaningful uplift in the attach rate of installation services to tire purchases. Within our focused categories, our eBay Refurbished program also continues to be a standout. In the current economic climate, our range of refurbished goods has proven to be more valuable than ever and consumers are increasingly aware of the sustainability benefits of purchasing these products. Building off its record holiday quarter, growth in eBay Refurbished GMV accelerated notably during Q1, posting double-digit year-over-year growth. We added dozens of new categories to the program last quarter, including computing and video game peripherals. We also signed up more brands and OEMs in existing categories to sell refurbished inventory directly on eBay. Additionally, in recent months, we've taken steps to make the onboarding process for small business sellers in the eBay Refurbished program faster and more scalable by automating elements of the sign-up and eligibility check processes. This is important because small business sellers make up the majority of refurbished goods sales on eBay and bring some of our most unique and valuable inventory to the platform. Our work to improve the site-wide experience on eBay continued to build momentum in the first quarter. While eBay has operated a core AI platform for years, an upgrade to this platform last year has meaningfully accelerated our AI development philosophy across multiple areas of our organization. In search, we continue to improve retrieval and ranking using state-of-the-art deep learning models and better leveraging the vast amount of structured listing data on our marketplace, which delivers more relevant choices to our buyers. A series of search deployments we made during Q1 led to a measurable uplift in conversion that we estimate would amount to roughly $1 billion in incremental GMV on an annualized basis. This demonstrates the value that a relatively small number of AI-powered enhancements can generate for a marketplace of our scale. Another key area of foundational improvement is our proprietary computer vision technology. With 1.8 billion live listings and billions more images from historical sales, eBay is one of the few companies in the world training deep neural networks using tens of billions of images directly linked to commercially relevant data elements. Leveraging these assets, our product team recently reengineered our visual similarity models, which has dramatically improved the speed and efficacy of image search on eBay. This change has driven more relevant search results and a substantial increase in adoption, image query volume and purchase behavior. It also enables new features like the See Visually Similar results module, we are testing within select subcategories of furniture and home decor. These capabilities are powerful unlocks in helping eBay buyers discover more of the unique and hard to describe items on our marketplace. For example, if you have an antique vase that breaks, you can now just take a picture of the pattern and find an exact match for a potential replacement on eBay. Our advancements in computer vision also have profound implications for the selling experience on eBay. Over the coming quarters, you'll see us testing new experiences, harnessing our improved visual and contextual understanding of product images to assist our sellers in listing products. For instance, sellers will soon be able to pre-populate categories and item specifics from a single photo, enabling them to spend less of their time inputting inventory and more on growing and managing their businesses. eBay is also well positioned to benefit from recent leaps forward in generative AI capabilities. We are in the process of integrating the ChatGPT API into our core listing flow and will soon launch a beta release of a plug-in that enables sellers to automatically generate text for their item description based on known product attributes. Generative AI has a number of exciting use cases outside of descriptions, and we're exploring numerous potential applications across our marketplace that can enable truly magical customer experiences. I'm excited to share more about these initiatives with you over the coming quarters. For store sellers, we recently launched a centralized tool, making it more seamless to publish and promote their listings across social media. This new feature is integrated into the Seller Hub and makes it easier to bulk post across several popular social channels with content that is automatically optimized for each medium, including engaging carousels that allow shoppers to browse multiple listings in a single post. Thousands of store sellers have already linked their social accounts to date, and on average, they observed 40% higher click through rates on content published using this new tool versus what was previously available. Last quarter, we talked to you about the February rollout of our new eBay International Shipping program, which makes it as easy for eBay sellers to ship from Silicon Valley to Sydney as it is to ship to St. Louis. The revamped program is not only making cross-border trade more seamless and cost effective for sellers and buyers, but it also improves trust in eBay's coordination of the end-to-end shipping process. During Q1, we fully ramped this program to sellers in the U.S. and migrated 100% of listings from our previous global shipping program. While its early days for the new program, we're already observing a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Over the long term, we believe eBay International Shipping will increase cross border inventory available to buyers, improve sales velocity and price realization for sellers and ultimately drive incremental GMV. Now transitioning to advertising. Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth at scale despite challenges in the broader digital ad market. Strong demand for Promoted Listings drove first-party advertising revenue of $285 million, up 31% or more than 30 points faster than GMV growth for the third straight quarter. Total advertising revenue grew 23% to $317 million. During Q1, over 2 million sellers adopted single ad products, and we reached more than 750 million live Promoted Listings. Our standard CPA product was once again the largest contributor to advertising growth, benefiting from continued optimization and performance improvement. In Q1, we rolled out a new machine learning model for ranking CPA ads that improved sales philosophy for sellers and conversion for buyers. This ranking model also enables us to evaluate the expected performance of multiple ad products alongside each other rather than making ad-serving decisions in silos. This change will be beneficial as we continue to expand our multiproduct advertising portfolio. Our emerging Promoted Listings products also continued to scale and grew mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter during the seasonally slower Q1. This growth was led by Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost per click format, which benefited from an upgraded relevance model deployed in the quarter as well as the inclusion of CPC ads within more of our existing ad services. Now let's discuss the impact we're having on the communities we serve. I'm pleased that we continue to make meaningful progress on our key ESG initiatives. Just yesterday, we published our seventh Annual Diversity Equity and Inclusion report. This report provides insight into our four strategic objectives: increase representation, cultivate a sense of belonging, engage our communities and allies, and build inclusive technology. These objectives help us build a richly diverse, truly equitable and fiercely inclusive place to buy, sell and work. We have seen a steady increase in the number of women and underrepresented minorities in all levels enrolled since 2020, with women representing 42% of our global workforce. I'm also proud to report eBay's gender pay equity is at 100% globally. The next here I would like to highlight is around reducing our impact on the planet. Two years ago, we set ambitious long-term science based targets. In 2022, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 7% versus 2021 and by 32% from our baseline in 2019. We also continue to make progress on our Scope 3 reduction goal. Lastly, 91% of our energy now comes from renewable sources and we remain a carbon-neutral company. You can find more details about our sustainability programs in our annual impact report coming out next month. In addition, we continue to partner with other organizations across the industry to make an even bigger impact on sustainability. Throughout 2022, we partnered with some of our e-commerce peers to encourage the U.S. Postal Service to adopt more innovative and sustainable shipping practices for small businesses. Our efforts culminated in a letter published in February 2023 congratulating USPS for their commitment to exclusively purchasing electric delivery vehicles by 2026. This shift not only helps the environment but also our customers by enabling lower costs and other benefits offered by an all-electric delivery fleet. Turning to eBay for Charity. The eBay community continues to demonstrate its tremendous generosity, and I'm always impressed by the contributions from this program. In Q1, eBay for Charity raised over $38 million, up 3% year-over-year. During the quarter, the program continued to support important initiatives like a Black History Month sneaker campaign, highlighting Black sneaker designers and influencers. Additionally, during Q1, the eBay Foundation committed $11 million to non-profit organizations advancing inclusive entrepreneurship. The foundation also supported disaster relief efforts with employee contributions and matching gifts. All of these efforts combined demonstrate our purpose driven community and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. Newsweek recognized eBay for our efforts around diversity in the workplace as well as our customer service. Additionally, eBay was once again included in JUST Capital and CNBC's list of America's Most Just Companies, which measures corporate performance and efforts in areas such as climate change, DE&I and employee wellness. Lastly, we were ranked among some of the top companies on S&P's Global Sustainability Yearbook, which distinguishes companies for their strengths in corporate sustainability. In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter for eBay. We exceeded our quarterly financial commitments while making significant progress against our long-term objectives. Our focused categories grew roughly 8 points faster than the rest of our marketplace, led by an acceleration in the P&A category, which reached market rates of growth in Q1. Our core AI platform has dramatically improved our tech velocity, leading to accelerated innovation in areas like search, computer vision, generative AI and advertising. We continue to find more ways to leverage our scale for the benefit of sellers, most recently with our eBay International Shipping program. This initiative is reducing costs, alleviating friction and improving trust for cross border transactions. And ultimately, we believe it will lead to more of our sellers' unique inventory being made available globally. And we continue to make meaningful progress with our pay equity, representation efforts, charitable contributions made through our platform and our impact on the environment. Lastly, I'd like to thank our talented eBay employees who have been relentlessly focused on raising the bar for innovation and service to our customers. I'm also grateful I was able to meet and personally connect with a number of our sellers during my travels last quarter. Hearing their feedback and seeing the impact eBay is having on their businesses is truly inspiring. Our sellers, along with our enthusiast buyers truly make eBay a more vibrant marketplace and community. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yeah. Look, the first thing I'd point to, Eric is the 8-point outperformance of focused categories over the rest of the business. In these areas where we're investing in, we're seeing the right types of growth. When I look at a category like P&A, which is our largest full funnel marketing to date, you look at the results this quarter, where we're at market rates of growth and we're really excited by what we're seeing there. I think enthusiast buyers as well in the quarter and active buyers were strong. For the third straight quarter, we had an aggregate new and reactivated buyers growing positively. And our new buyer growth was positive for the first time in eight quarters. And let me give you an example of how that ties into marketing. So in P&A, where we've had this large full funnel marketing campaign, new and reactivated buyers actually grew double-digits faster than the overall marketplace during the quarter. So this has been a shift for us that we've been talking about all along, which is moving from just lower funnel optimization to more full funnel, driving long-term consideration, which takes a little bit of time. But the results that we're seeing off of that spend are great and are creating a really healthy business as evidenced by what we're seeing in the focused category outperformance. Yeah. And then on live commerce, this is something we began experimenting with Q2 of last year, hosting a few pilots and experimenting with it throughout Q2. We did expand it into luxury in Q4 with some events for handbags and jewelry. We also created a central hub and discovery entry point for our live commerce events in Q4, which means now users can subscribe to a specific channel or receive updates and notifications of upcoming events. This year, we hosted about 15 eBay Live events with over $500,000 of in-event GMV across collectibles and luxuries. And at the end of March, we started hosting our first short auctions, think like 30 seconds for handbags and collectibles. In general, these are getting 5,000 and 15,000 buyers. We're seeing great engagement from that standpoint so we're going to continue to pilot and learn and experiment with this technology, but exciting initial results thus far. Yeah. Just in general, our luxury and fashion focused categories and on aggregate accelerated in line with our business overall. We continue to expand brand coverage on the platform, et cetera. So think about kind of very similar to what I said last quarter, which is some, a little bit of ASP pressure really made up for by the volume that we're seeing on the platform. In general, our shift to non-new-in-season and that focus has really helped us in this environment because people are looking for values. And the ones that they can get on our platform make us much more resilient from that standpoint. Yeah. Just on focused categories, I'd say a couple of things. One is, overall, focused categories outperformed the rest of the business by 8 percentage points, so we're definitely seeing the impact of the strategy. A couple of standouts is one, we've already talked about it, but motors, parts and accessories hitting market rates of growth for us was really happening kind of sooner than we thought. I talked about luxury already kind of being a stable growth vector for us. And then maybe the other one I'd highlight for you is just refurbished. Our Refurbished business grew double digits in the quarter. That's really coming off of a healthy Q4 where we had our largest week ever with Refurbished and Cyber. And I think that's two-fold. One is the value proposition that we provide in that focused category is pretty compelling. And two is we're continuing to invest in bringing new brands, making the process easier for small businesses to come on with their refurbished products and we're backing it up with a great trust guarantee. On parts and accessories, I'd just say that we actually feel really good about the growth rates that we're seeing there, probably happening even sooner than we thought. We just launched Guaranteed Fit a few months ago. And I've always said these things take a couple of quarters to really have the impact on the consumer in really kind of changing the trust equation, but we're seeing a lot of great movement from that perspective already. So I talked about the buyers on the platform in P&A, New and reactivated buyers in that category are growing double digits faster than the overall marketplace. So it makes me really excited for the future of what we're going to do in P&A. And just like in other categories, we're not done investing. We'll continue to roll out new innovations that are really relevant for that parts and accessory buyer on eBay. Yeah. So I'd say just first on the benefits of eBay, one is the scale. So when products coming to luxury on eBay, they're available in 190 different markets around the world with 130 million plus buyers from that standpoint. So that's a massive advantage. Now that we have authenticity guarantee across our handbags, it basically takes trust off of the table and makes eBay an amazing destination to buy those items. The third thing I'd say is, we have really competitive fees from that standpoint. So if you're looking to sell those products, it's very attractive. I was talking to one of our sellers in handbags who did a live commerce event with us this past quarter and was just really excited by the results and the buyer demand that we were able to bring to something like that. The other unique benefit that we have on eBay is across categories. So we're bringing in buyers not just from handbag buyers but buyers across other categories on the platform and bringing them into handbags. So for our business, the average handbag buyer who buys a handbag over $500, they're going to spend $2,600 in handbags, but then they're going to end up spending $5,600 in other categories in the platform, and that's a really unique advantage for us on the platform. In terms of your questions on home and garden, I'd go back to what I said at Investor Day, which is we have five categories that are over 10 billion, home and garden being one of them, fashion being another, P&A. And so P&A was the largest one we've taken on to date and we've seen really good results. And I've said that every focused category -- I mean, every category that we have, we believe that we can apply the playbook to over time on the platform. So we don't like to get ahead of announcing where we're going for competitive reasons. But we believe this playbook and, in fact, is what we're seeing in P&A is applicable to even our largest categories. Yeah. Lauren, I would say our active buyer count is exactly where we expected it to be. I've been talking for several quarters about some near-term pressure that we thought we would see based on the macro environment, but that I thought we would see stabilization in the metric, and that's exactly what we're seeing here is that we're acquiring buyers in the right way now. We're building and turning them into enthusiast buyers, and our enthusiast buyers are buying 70% of the GMV on the platform. And so we're excited that we saw kind of a more modest change in stabilization. And the P&A stats that I talked about with buyers is also really encouraging because it shows when we invest, we're actually seeing what we want to see with new and reactivated buyers on the platform. So as things change from that standpoint, we'll continue to update you, but we actually feel really great about what's happening on the buying side. Yeah. Look, we've always considered shipping as variable, so we can pass through those expenses to the seller from that standpoint. What we give them is the benefits of scale. So when you look at eBay's scale advantages in being able to work with providers from that standpoint and being able to manage things efficiently. When you buy your label through eBay as an example, you're getting a very good discount versus what you would pay if you just walked in and tried to do those shipments on your own. And so we're going to continue to bring our scale to benefits like this. This one is really about opening up that inventory. So we wanted to almost be invisible to the seller based in the geography that they're shipping internationally. So the example I talked about is, if I'm sitting in Manhattan, I can ship a product that's actually going to Spain, but it will feel like I'm shipping a product to Albany because we take care of everything in the background. So it's really about that 20% of GMV that we do in cross-border. As Steve said, less than half of our inventory is available to go across borders. And this is really about creating that unlock. And it's, frankly, one of the powerful weapons of eBay is because as even a casual seller on the platform, we open up such massive worldwide scale demand for you in 190 different countries. So think about the EIS kind of similar to ads or payments. It's us leveraging our scale for the benefit of our sellers. Yeah. And Lee, what I'd say on the PL Advanced or our CPC-based business is, in Q1, we updated our [indiscernible] model, training it on CPC-specific data. That helped us present higher quality impressions and more GMV for the same number of impressions on the site. We also expanded CPC to the second row of ad placements within search results, which was previously only available to CPA. So it's still early in our CPC development. We're excited about these innovations. We also built some new technologies this quarter that helped us do better real-time evaluation between CPA and CPC. But what I would say is that we're well on track to the numbers that we outlined at Investor Day. And we think a big component of that in terms of new products is the Product Listings Advanced product and happy with the continued innovation quarter-after-quarter to kind of drive towards those targets. Yeah. Look, advertising once again outpaced volume by 33 percentage points, driven by what we're doing in optimizing product listings across both standard and our more advanced products. We continue to think we have a long runway ahead of us for advertising. And I'd point to a couple of things. One is, we continue to see nice quarter-over-quarter growth in our new advertising products, that's External Express and Promoted Listings Advanced. The second thing I'd say is that we have a variable model where sellers can set their rates. And we're seeing really good ROAS for our sellers. So when we look at the return on ad spend that they're seeing, once they start using our ad products, their sales are basically seeing a double-digit increase. And more importantly, when you look at the ROAS that they can get on eBay, it's very attractive relative to industry standards. So as I said before, we feel like we're on track and executing towards the goals that we laid out. We feel like we're doing a nice job of balancing the buying experience and keeping that incredibly healthy and strong conversion while continuing to drive our ads business. And finally, we're just making the product easier to use. So quarter-after-quarter, we've built new products. Most recently, we've built a quick setup, a product for our CPC-based product to make that easier to use. And we continue to build up new reporting tools for our advertising sellers. So we're excited by where we are and the potential that's ahead. Steve, do you want to take the next part?"

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay as our gross merchandise volume grew by over 1% to $18.3 billion, marking our second straight quarter of positive GMV growth. Revenue increased by more than 3% to $2.58 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 16% to $1.19. Now let's turn to the key drivers of our Q3 results. Our focused categories continue to deliver relevant experiences to customers and drive growth for our overall marketplace. Focus category GMV grew by nearly 5% in Q3, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by approximately five points. This growth was driven by broad-based momentum across motors, parts and accessories, collectibles, refurbished and our luxury fashion categories. Collectibles had a particularly strong quarter as trading GMV accelerated to double-digit growth in Q3, driven by strength in sports trading cards and collectible card gains both on the eBay platform and through our subsidiary, TCGplayer. During Q3, we engaged with Collectibles enthusiasts at key industry trade shows including the National Sports Collectors Convention, GenCon and San Diego, Cometa. We expanded our high ASP inventory through monthly marquee auctions and consignment from trusted partners like TSA and ComC. And we continue to scale and evolve the eBay live experience, fueling particular momentum in areas like trading card case break. On top healthy organic momentum, our recent acquisition Goldin is opening up exciting opportunities in the collectibles world. Just last week, Ken Goldin and team completed a record sales for Shohei Ohtani's 50th homerun ball, which sold for nearly $4.4 million, making it the most valuable baseball ever sold. Auctions for truly one-of-a-kind items like this can generate a lot of awareness for our platform where hobbyists can shop for everything ranging from low ASP ungraded trading cards to some of the world's most valuable collectible items. Fashion is also a critical entry point for us. As nearly one in five new sellers and buyers come to eBay through fashion category. During Q3, we launched a new creative campaign called Things People Love to raise awareness of eBay's value proposition in pre-love fashion. We focused on driving relevance with key audiences like GenZ by highlighting eBay's breadth and depth of quality pre-loved inventory backed by truck. Our full funnel marketing strategy has been instrumental in driving continued momentum in focused categories and healthier trends in active buyers, which grew nearly 1% to $133 million in Q3. One of the key building blocks underpinning our return to positive GMV growth has been our geo-specific investment, where we leverage our innovation playbook from focused categories to better serve customer needs at the local level. While many of these product experience changes benefit all sellers and buyers, we are particularly focused on consumer-to-consumer or C2C sellers for several reasons. C2C sellers bring some of the most unique inventory to eBay and are typically less price sensitive than B2C sellers. C2C sellers accelerate e-commerce as roughly 60% of their GMV comes from used and refurbished items compared to 40% for our marketplace overall. Selling on eBay also creates a flywheel effect that stimulates incremental GMV as buyers who sell purchased roughly twice as much on eBay as non-sellers with most of their incremental spend supporting small businesses. As a reminder, our first major geo-specific initiative launched in Germany in March of 2023, and more than 18 months later, we continue to see significantly higher customer satisfaction or CSAT and improved GMV trends for the overall German market. This past April, we rolled out significant enhancements in the UK for pre-owned apparel categories. These improvements included simplified tools for selling and new tools to drive demand through enhanced discovery like Explore and Shop the look. Since then, we have observed material improvements to key C2C metrics like CSAT and active sellers alongside a double-digit improvement in C2C GMV growth in pre-owned apparel versus our prior baseline. The success of our Germany initiative over the last 1.5 years and similar results in the UK over the last six months gave us the confidence to move forward with a significant expansion of our UK initiative earlier this month. We introduced a suite of new capabilities to upgrade the overall C2C experience in UK, including a simplified native listing flow, managed shipping, which streamlines the domestic shipping experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay, improved local pickup and discovery capabilities and eBay balance, which allows UK sellers to store their earnings or use them as spendable funds on eBay. We accompanied this future rollout with a full funnel marketing campaign in the UK, which highlights the ease of selling on eBay. We also eliminated final value fees and regulatory operating keys for UK C2C sellers across all categories, excluding motor vehicles. We made this change due to clear evidence that European consumers are more motivated to lift their items online when it's free to sell even when buyer fees are introduced. We believe reducing the friction to sell will unlock a significantly larger total addressable market, or TAM, in C2C. We will initially monetize our UK C2C volume in several ways, including advertising, cross-border fees and our sell-to-buy flywheel. In Q4, we will begin to ramp our managed shipping initiative in the UK. We also plan introduce a buyer-facing fee on UK's C2C transactions during Q1 of 2025. Next, I'll walk through some of the major enhancements to the UK experience. One of the most significant changes we launched in October was the horizontal rollout of a simplified native listing flow for UK C2C sellers. This experience dramatically reduces the number of steps and decision points for sellers, offers intelligent pricing recommendations, seamlessly integrates AI-generated descriptions and photo enhancements and better highlights the benefits of advertising. Since launch, the simplified flow has notably decreased time to list, improved listing completion rates, increased conversion, sold items and GMV per listing attempt and elevated adoption of promoted listings. With managed shipping, we are completely overhauling our shipping experience for C2C sellers in the UK in two phases. The first phase completed in early October, extended the simplified shipping experience we first rolled out in pre-owned apparel to all categories. Within the new native listing flow, UK C2C sellers now see a consolidated list of shipping options based on the estimated package size and weight. And since implementing this change, we have observed a significant reduction in time spent on shipping in a listing flow. The second phase of managed shipping; radically simplifies the experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay. Similar to managed payments and eBay international shipping, Managed shipping leverages our scale and expertise to create a better experience for customers while generating incremental revenue and operating income dollars. When listing eligible products sellers simply confirm the pre-selected package size and eBay handles the rest. Buyers received competitive shipping rates and sellers are fully protected against loss or damage. Managed shipping is currently live for C2C pre-owned apparel listing in the UK. In Q4, we plan to expand managed shipping horizontally on an opt-out basis, before mandating the program for eligible items listed by U.C2C sellers during Q1 of 2025. In addition to shipping, we launched a number of enhancements to the local pickup experience in the UK. As these transactions make up a significant portion of our C2C TAM in this market, we increased local supply by defaulting new C2C listings to offer both pickup and shipping options. We created a new eBay local landing page and map view for optimal browsing of nearby inventory. We also enhance trust, improve post-sale education for shoppers and streamline the in-person payment process. Since launch, we've seen a significant uptick in locally enabled listings in the UK and a double-digit improvement in local C2C volume growth. Lastly, in mid-October, we added the eBay balance feature in the UK. This gives millions of C2C sellers the flexibility to use their earnings to shop on eBay, promote their listings, purchase shipping labels or withdrawal available funds whenever they wish. With eBay balance, we believe we can further stimulate the cell to buy flywheel and also reduce the cost of payments when sellers spend their earnings on eBay. Taking a step back by making these changes, we believe we are addressing three of the longest-standing pain points for UK sellers on eBay. These delist the amount of time and effort it takes to create a listing and the complexities involved with shipping. During the first few weeks since the broader UK C2C initiative launch, we've seen more than 20-point increases in new and reactivated listers and sellers and material increases in C2C sold items and GMV. We are confident that these changes will not only be great for our community, but also our shareholders. Our strategic focus on C2C should open up a significantly larger TAM in e-commerce by unlocking consumers' closets, basements and garages. Our teams continue to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to deliver magical innovations for our customers. In recent months, eBay's core AI team released the second generation of our proprietary LiLiuM series of large language models, developed in-house using our high-performance supercomputer. Notably, these models have outperformed public benchmarks in eBay specific tasks like description generation, title creation, aspect extraction and pricing predictions. Behind the scenes, these models have already been deployed to accelerate the transformation of selling and buying on eBay, including magical listing. The first phase of our magic listing experience generates high-quality listing descriptions with the push of a button. Approximately 10 million unique sellers have used this feature to date, creating over 100 million listings. GenAI enhanced listings have also generated several billion dollars of cumulative GMV on eBay. Additionally, more than one-quarter of US mobile app users have access to the next iteration of magic listing and beta. After taking or uploading a photo, this experience leverages computer vision and generative AI to pre--fill or suggest the title, category, description and other item aspects for listing. This app for this beta remains extremely high at roughly 90% as we continue to optimize model performance and efficiency. We are also leveraging GenAI to enhance our tools for our B2C sellers, we recently introduced the magical bulk listing tool, which leverages our internal LLM to seamlessly create a large number of pre-populated listings at one. Sellers simply uploads photos in bulk and individual listings are created with category, title and item specifics pre-filled where possible. The magical bulk listing tool was launched for all B2C US trading card sellers in Q3 and early feedback has been extremely positive. In Q4, we've also begun to roll out this tool to sellers in other categories. Turning next to advertising. During Q3, first-party advertising grew 14% and while total ad revenue grew 11% to $408 million and eclipse 2.2% penetration of GMV. Nearly 3.2 million sellers adopted a single ad product during the quarter, and we ended Q3 with over $1 billion live promoted listings out of more than $2.1 billion total live listings. Within the ads portfolio, Promoted Listings were the largest contributor to year-over-year growth led by cost per click ad unit. Promoted offsite ads were the fastest growing among our first-party ads. And during the quarter, we rolled out several performance optimizations and scaled our go-to-market efforts for these ads, raising awareness, adoption and retention amongst our seller base. Promoted stores ads are the most nascent product in our portfolio. But during Q3, we began to gradually ramp these ads through contextually relevant placements at the top of search and on the new order details page. Next, I'd like to discuss our work in payments and financial services, where we continue to expand choice and flexibility for buyers, and offer new solutions for sellers to grow their businesses on eBay. In Germany, we are expanding our breadth of payment options through our partnership with Riverty, a German Fintech company offering solutions used by 28 million consumers. We are introducing a monthly invoice payment option through Riverty, enabling German buyers to pay for multiple purchases on eBay at a later date with no interest or fees if the payment is made on time. According to an eBay consumer survey, more than three-quarter of online shoppers in Germany prefer to use invoicing as a payment method for online shopping. So we are pleased to offer another locally relevant payment option for our customers in this region. For small business sellers, we continue to expand the eBay seller capital program through trusted partners. In July, we launched Business Cash Advance, a revenue-based financing solution provided by Liberis. In October, we expanded our partnership with Liberis to offer flexible cash advances to US sellers. This program offers financing for sums of up to $2 million with the flexibility for sellers to tap into capital on demand and a lot more financing over time. I am pleased to share that through these programs with Liberis, we have already enabled thousands of small business seller\u2019s access to over $40 million of growth capital. And in aggregate, across all of our seller capital partnership, we've connected eBay sellers with over $100 million of working capital year-to-date. Next, I'd like to share a few ways we're making an impact in our community. eBay for Charity raised more than $49 million in Q3, up 21% year-over-year. Additionally, the eBay Foundation awarded nearly $3 million to Grand Teas across the globe who are supporting entrepreneurship for historically excluded groups. I'm always amazed by the generosity of our buyers and sellers, and I'm proud we're able to support important causes around the world. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. We sustained positive GMV growth for the second straight quarter, amid a dynamic macro and operating environment, led by nearly 5% growth in our focus categories. The rest of our marketplace was nearly flat for the second consecutive quarter, supported by horizontal innovation and our C2C investments in key geographies. We continue to see strong growth in our first-party ad products across portfolio and broaden our range of payments and financial service offerings for sellers and buyers. And importantly, we remain focused on operational discipline alongside our investments in long-term growth initiatives to ensure continued healthy growth in operating income and earnings per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and initial thoughts on next year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparison on an organic FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. eBay delivered strong top and bottom line results in Q3 our focused categories, geo-specific investments from horizontal initiatives drove a second consecutive quarter of positive GMV growth amid an uneven macroeconomic environment. Gross merchandise volume grew over 1% to $18.3 billion. Revenue grew over 3% to $2.58 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6% to $700 million. We delivered $1.19 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 16%, and we returned $881 million to shareholders to be reported on dividend. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume grew over 1% to $18.3 billion on an organic FX-neutral basis. Goldin contributed nearly 30 basis points of total FX-neutral volume growth and foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 30 basis points of spot growth. We continue to face a dynamic macro and consumer spending environment in the quarter. And as we noted on the last earnings call, political news, sporting events and elevated travel in July influenced consumer behavior. Strong execution within our strategic initiatives helped us navigate these headwinds. Focused category GMV grew nearly 5%, approximately five points faster than the remainder of our marketplace. Our momentum in focused categories is broad-based with continued positive growth in P&A, collectibles, refurbished and our luxury categories. The remainder of our marketplace is nearly flat year-over-year for the second straight quarter, driven by craft category shopping, horizontal innovation, geo-specific initiatives and resilient growth in e-commerce. Moving to our trends on a geographic basis. US GMV grew by nearly one point in the third quarter. Similar to Q2, we saw improved trends in organic traffic in the US and continued momentum in focused categories led by collectibles, refurbished and luxury fashion. International GMV grew by nearly 2% on an FX-neutral basis in Q3, while FX was a 0.5 point tailwind spot growth. In the UK and Germany, we continue to navigate more challenging macroeconomic conditions and lower consumer confidence while seeing strength in parts and accessories and improved trends in C2C volume. Cross-border trade continues to be an important driver of international GMV growth, led by exports in Greater China and Japan into our major markets. CBT was also a significant contributor to growth and focused categories, particularly P&L. Next, let's take a look at buyers. Trailing 12 month active buyers grew by nearly 1% to $133 million. Our strategic initiatives and full funnel marketing campaigns help drive continued growth in new and reactivated buyers and improved retention. Buyers were stable at roughly $16 million [indiscernible] buyer grew slightly year-over-year to just over $3,100. Moving to revenue. In Q3, we grew revenue by over 3% to $2.58 billion, foreign exchange was a 30 basis point headwind to spot revenue growth. Our take rate was 14.1% and nearly 20 basis points year-over-year; first-party advertising, shipping and financial services all contributed to our take rate expansion, which was slightly offset by the CTC initiatives and an FX headwind of nearly 10 basis points. On a sequential basis, our take rate expanded by over 10 basis points. Total advertising revenue grew 11% to $408 million in the third quarter and represented over 2.2% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew over 14% to $396 million, and we accelerated modestly from Q2 level. Third-party display ads revenue declined nearly 43% year-over-year as we continue to deprecate these legacy ad units. Next, I'll discuss our profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin was flat year-over-year as a reduction in cost of payments and lower depreciation expenses were roughly offset by traffic acquisition costs, tax related matters and foreign exchange headwind. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by over 80 basis points year-over-year to 27.2% in Q3, driven by operational efficiencies, partly offset by investments in full funnel marketing and a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 20 basis points. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 6% in the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16% to $1.19. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.29 in Q3. The difference was primarily due to an increase in the value of our investment portfolio, partly offset by stock-based compensation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $646 million, down year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes. Last year, the majority of our cash tax payments delays until Q4 due to California's disaster tax release program. At the end of Q3, we had cash and non-equity investments of $5.8 billion and gross debt of $7.4 billion. We repurchased $750 million of eBay shares during Q3 at an average price of approximately $57 and had roughly $1.2 billion remaining under our buyback authorization the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $131 million in September or $0.27 per share. Shifting to our investment portfolio, our equity investments and warrants were valued at $3 billion at the end of the quarter with [indiscernible], Adevinta and G-Market accounted for majority of the value. We retained approximately 18% ownership of Adevinta, which is a privatized ad event entity, and that ownership is valued at roughly $1.9 billion based on the value as at the close of the transaction. The consortium led by Permira and Blackstone as the option through November 29th to purchase from eBay roughly 10% ownership of the private entity for just over $1 billion. Our adding warrants were valued at approximately $0.5 billion at the end of Q3. On October 15th, we met the processing volume milestone necessary to invest the second tranche of our Adevinta. We subsequently paid $105 million to exercise the chance for approximately 404,000 shares of Adevinta stock, which are valued at approximately $602 million based on the company's share price at the time. Turning to our outlook. We expect to generate GMV between $18.9 billion and $19.3 billion in the fourth quarter, representing FX-neutral growth between flat from 2% year-over-year. We expect Goldin to contribute over 30 basis points of GMV growth in the quarter. At current rates, foreign currency would represent a roughly two-point tailwind to GMV growth in Q4. We expect continued momentum in GMV to be driven by multiple strategic initiatives across focused categories, the UK and Germany and horizontal areas. Our outlook also contemplates a challenging operating environment due to persistent economic headwinds and several one-off dynamics in Q4, secifically greater consumer attention on US elections, a shorter holiday shopping period this year from Hurricane Milton in early October the forecast revenue between $2.53 billion and $2.59 billion in the fourth quarter, representing FX-neutral growth of negative 1% to positive 1%. At current rates, we estimate FX would represent a nearly 30 basis point tailwind to spot revenue growth. We anticipate our UK C2C initiative will modestly benefit total GMV growth in Q4. While certain existing levers like advertising, cross-border fees, and our sell-to-buy flywheel to continue to contribute revenue on UK C2C volume. We do not expect material revenue contribution in Q4 from our two major remonetization efforts. Managed shipping, which is ramping starting in Q4 through Q1 of 2025 and Biofeedback, which we plan to introduce in the back half of Q1. We launched our UK initiative in October to provide the best experience for our sellers and buyers and our second largest market ahead of the critical holiday season. We also believe it is the right decision to phase in this new monetization program to give our customers time to adjust to changes. For Q4, we forecast non-GAAP operating margin between 26.5% and 27%. In addition to pressure from our UK initiative, expenses related to M&A and integration costs and over 30 basis points of impact to our consolidated operating margin and foreign currency is another 60 basis points of headwind year-over-year. For the full year, this implies 60 to 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.17 and $1.22 in the fourth quarter, representing year-over-year growth between 9% and 14%. This implies full year non-GAAP EPS growth between 13% and 14%. We forecast capital expenditure to be about 4.5% of revenue for the full year, and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We continue to expect free cash flow of just under $2 billion for the full year. We are further raising our share repurchase target for 2024 to $3 billion, implying $750 million of repurchase during Q4. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. Now, I'd like to make a few initial comments on our financial priorities for 2025. We plan to balance the need to reinvest for long-term growth against the near-term top and bottom line performance. Assuming an unchanged macro environment, we are planning our business to run positive FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income dollar growth modestly ahead of GMV and high single-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share year-over-year. As it pertains to margins, we plan to target the optimal combination of GMV growth and operating margin to maximize operating income dollar growth. There were some unique considerations for 2025, influencing our financial architecture. Similar to eBay International shipping program, our managed shipping initiative in the U. we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our current assumption is that UK managed shipping will pressure our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 40 basis points in 2025, while contributing positively to operating income dollars. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. Our GMV grew for a second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16%. These results clearly demonstrate that our strategy is working, we have the right balance between delivering robust standing, reinvesting to drive long-term sustainable growth and delivering healthy capital returns to shareholders. We plan to follow these same principles and build on this year's momentum as we finalize our plans for 2025. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nYgal Arounian: Hey guys, good afternoon. I wanted to ask on the e-commerce initiatives, it seems to be a greater focus here. Maybe first, just on the monetization efforts. How should we think about the catch-up to breakeven on the fees that you're giving up? And do you think that over time, the new monetization model can be more monetizable than the previous one? And how do we think about -- or how do you think about this opportunity and expanding it to the US? And if it works in the UK, and is worth in Germany and how could this expand to eBay more broadly?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Look, we're launching this from a position of strength. Let me tell you how we're thinking about it. We've delivered positive GMV growth in the past two quarters. And we have strong conviction. We started 1.5 years ago in Germany and saw really strong results there. And our early results in preowned apparel in the U.K. give us the confidence to move forward. We made the decision to launch this in October 1 to really take advantage of the holiday period in our second largest market. We believe it's the right decision to phase this in for our sellers and buyers, because the other thing you've got to remember here, Ygal, is just it's a change to the marketplace, and we want to give sellers and buyers time to adjust their processes. So that's why we're going to ramp up managed shipping through Q4 and Q1. And why we decided to introduce the buyer fees in the back half of Q1. So the pressure that you're seeing on revenue in Q4 is primarily a timing dynamic given that ramp of managed shipping over Q4 and through Q1. And then introducing the buyer fee in the back half of Q1, so some of that remonetization lag will likely spill over to Q1. But we believe that these changes are clear, we believe based on where buyer fees are in the UK, we have the ability to remonetize these moving those fees around. And remember, it's not just those two, but it's also advertising. It's the cross-border fees that we charge, because as well as the seller buyer flywheel that we see. But the strategic benefits of doing this are really clear. We're going to unlock a significant portion of TAM in our second largest market and ultimately generate long-term growth for eBay and value for our shareholders. And as Steve said, Steve gave some preliminary commentary on FY 2025. And as we expect to grow GMV and revenue year-on-year, grew operating income modestly faster than GMV and increased our EPS by high single digits year-over-year. To your question on the US, we have no plans to launch free selling in the US. US is a different market from the UK. UK buyers and sellers are more open to buyer fees. It's more standard in the market. There may be certain aspects of the product experience that streamlined selling that we bring to other markets. And as you know, we look at each market in categories and think about the specifics of what the optimal set of initiatives to unlock more supply and demand for that specific market.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks. And like a follow-up on the second-gen of ROI [ph]. You guys are releasing and some of what you're seeing, you talked about outperforming the public benchmarks. Any way to frame how that's impacting volume growth, are you seeing it roll through yet? Is there any way to quantify that? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah, we are. It's been really great to see how sellers and buyers have responded to this. In that new model, we're outperforming the public benchmarks on things like descriptions, titles, aspect, we've seen a better job at precision pricing, increasing by double digits through these new models that we have on the platform. And what's great about the AI that we're launching is it's having a major impact at scale. So if I look at it just since we've launched these tools, over 10 million sellers have taken advantage of it, and over 100 million listings have adopted it. And cumulatively, we've generated several billion dollars of cumulative GMV from GenAI enhanced listing since launch. And we're still continuing to ramp up, improve the models, expose more and more people to Magical listings. So I feel really good about it. The other thing is we saw some demand from our small business and our B2C sellers, to have access to the tools that we have built. So this quarter, we launched Magical Bulk listings. And essentially, what that does is if I'm a business seller, let's say, I've got 25 watches or trading cards that I want to list, I can just upload a couple of photos of each and will, in the background, use our large language model and the product knowledge graph to fill in all the description, title and aspect information for those using that same technology that we built for single listings to do bulk listing. So still early stages, but really excited by the performance of what we're seeing in AI.\nYgal Arounian: Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks for providing the framework for 2025, very helpful. A couple of questions on that. So first, on focus categories within the positive GMV, is there still room to grow faster there? And what are some of the initiatives that you're most excited about? And then on take rates, maybe I know you can give us a revenue growth, but some of the puts and takes for revenue take rates on GMV next year? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. So I'll start with the first one and then Steve will talk about the take rate. So on focused categories, yeah, look, another solid quarter. We delivered 5% growth, parts and accessories continues to be a big growth driver of our focus categories. But we saw some momentum in other areas, specifically, I\u2019d talk about collectibles. We saw double-digit growth in collectibles this quarter. You've probably been seeing a number of the things that we were doing, but the combination of work that we're doing with TCGplayer, our Goldin, which is Goldin provides some of the world's most desirable inventory that's out there on the marketplace. If you're on Goldin right now, you see that we're doing Luke Homes and Eric Church are doing, raising money for the Carolinas, and that's all being driven by our family at Goldin, and then when you look at trading cards in particular, we've had this healthy run rate off of it, I said, as double-digit growth, really based on all of the innovations that we've done over time, like my collections, price guides, authentication, but also the grading partnership that we put in place with PSA, where now instead of sending an item into be graded and describe it on the way into grading and then getting it back and then listing it again on eBay then having to shift it to the buyer. That's all one seamless process now where I just ship it to PSA and it gets sold. So we're really seeing strength across the board in all of our focus categories. Refurbished continues to do well in this marketplace where people are -- consumers are challenged. And our luxury has also been contributing positively to year-over-year growth for the eighth straight quarter. So the work that we're doing with our new authentication center is there. So we have lots of momentum in our focus categories. We continue to expand the work we've done there. And I'm also just excited because the work that we've done for focused categories by verticals, we've been able to apply these geo-specific areas to C2C to great effect. I mean if you look at Germany, for example, we increased our C2C seller CSAT by 20 percentage points. And that's led to a real change in trajectory of our German business versus the prior baseline. So we will continue to push forward with our strategy, and we like what we're seeing.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Justin. Good to speak this afternoon. Obviously, we provided a fair bit of color on our 2025 architecture in the prepared remarks and believe this is a really robust financial outlook for 2025 and the continuation of the progress that we've continued to make this year. We're not going to provide any more specific precise guidance around take rate at this point, because we're finalizing our budgets. But I can talk to a few factors that you can consider for 2025. The first one is on shipping. Obviously, Jamie just elaborated on our UK C2C initiative. UK is our second largest market by volume and has a higher C2C penetration in Germany. And while there's this near-term impact on take rate as we eliminated final value fees for sellers, we will be monetizing that through the managed shipping, which is ramping now and will continue into the first quarter and the buyer fees, which is planned for the back half of Q1. The second item is really around advertising and financial services. We do expect advertising to continue to grow faster than GMV, driven by the momentum in first-party promoted listings and off-site ads and obviously, the improved seller experience that's coming from that. And to a lesser extent, we do expect some incremental revenue associated to financial services as we get into 2025.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. Maybe just sticking with the 2025 framework, does the 2025 framework assume expansion of focus categories next year? And can you remind us some of the larger categories on the platform that have yet to get focused category investment at this point? And then maybe just one on competition. You have a scaled sports-related collectible competitors who have direct relationships with leagues and maybe some supply advantages there, Walmart partnering in the fashion and sneaker vertical. Can you comment at all, would you see some of the most important strategic most in those two categories specifically to fight up competition from some of the larger competitors moving in there?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. As you know, Lee, we don't preannounce kind of anything that we're doing on focus categories for competitive reasons. I will say we have five categories that are over $10 billion on eBay, fashion, home and garden, collectibles, electronics and motors, parts and accessories. And so it shows you the breadth of what we have on there. We did purposely take some of the playbook that we've had going against verticals and put it against goes to great effect, and we really like the ROI that we've seen against that. The second thing I would say is that the horizontal investments that we've been making to drive our core categories have been really beneficial. And that's because of all of the generative AI capabilities we've been able to apply, those help both our focus categories but also in our core categories. And it's the second quarter in a row where we've had nearly flat growth in our core categories. To your question on collectibles business and competitive positioning, we feel great about the innovation that we're driving quarter after quarter from that standpoint. I mentioned this quarter as a very scaled player in the market. We continue to see double-digit growth in trading cards. We put together a really nice collection of assets. When you think about from TCGplayer in collectible card games to what we do on eBay to now Goldin, we sell everything from ungraded trading cards to the highest value products in hobby. And that's valuable, because collectors are generally looking kind of across that span to do so, and all the innovation that we've been driving in that category with collections, price guides, authentication, products that we've launched with TSA this new partnership that we've put in place with collectors. I mean, just think about it, all the things that we've been innovating are the exact things that collectors have asked us to do for years. They've asked us to say, make it easy for us to send a card in for grading and sell it on eBay. And now that's really seamless, and the CSAT on that is very, very high. When you look at the innovation that we're driving in eBay Live, we've done more and more case breaks every single quarter and added new capabilities there. We recently added last quarter, the ability to do buy spot, which is essentially to purchase your favorite team and track that through a case breaks and we continue to grow it. And the last thing I'd say is that, look, we've had had and we still have incredible relationships with top collectible sellers and we've always been a champion of the hobby shop. It's why we did TCGplayer deal. And we believe in open marketplace where enthusiasts can buy and sell the things that they love.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks guys. Appreciate the questions. I guess, first, Jamie, given these platform initiatives, I mean, do you think any of these will convert into growth and enthusiast buyers? Or is it really about increasing spending or share of wallet among the existing buyer base? And then the follow-up would be, I guess, Steve, regarding the Q4 one-off factors, could you maybe quantify the impact on growth you're embedding in guidance from those distractions, and if we should think about that as maybe potential upside if consumers end up spending at normal levels during the holidays? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Great question, Colin. So first off, absolutely, we see that converting into buyers and enthusiast buyers. You'll note that this quarter, we were up 1% in our active buyer count to $133 million, and while that's not a core KPI of it is an output of the strategy and the strategic initiatives that we've been driving and a healthy buyer funnel is important to our growth in enthusiast buyers. When you look specifically at the C2C initiative that we did in Germany and that we're talking about in the UK, it's great for the buying perspective for a couple of reasons. First is when we convert a buyer into seller, they become at least twice as valuable as a buyer as previously on the platform. And that's really great for buying. The second thing is C2C has really -- I call it the inventory goal on the platform. In general, they're bringing on things that aren't sold by a B2C seller or by a small business, think about all the stuff that you have around the house, that's not available from a B2C seller. And so when I look at the overall platform, we're about 40% used to refurbish, but in our C2C sellers, it's 60%. And so that unique inventory drives demand. It drives demand amid enthusiast buyers who find that part or that card or that thing they couldn't otherwise find on eBay. And the other great thing is that a little over three-quarters of our volume is B2C, but the vast majority of our sellers is C2C. And so what you see happening there is that, that flywheel of those C2C buying more from -- once they become buyers, actually, the majority of that new purchasing goes to small businesses and B2C sellers. So B2C sellers win as well from that increased buying activity on the platform. And that's why we really like the synergy of what we're seeing overall. It's why when we look at the trends in our German business, they're much healthier than before we made these changes. And we're excited both for what it does for sellers, but importantly, the demand that it drives for buyers. You'll also see across all of our markets, a new marketing campaign that's called Things People Love. And I think we had a link in the slide deck to show you some of the creative, but I'm really excited by the storytelling, because there's both a buying message in there but also a selling message about unlocking what's in your closet, your garage, your basement, and that's really healthy for us to drive that new initiative, and it's extremely well done, and it tested well. I'm excited for those campaigns.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Colin, just with regards to our assumptions in the fourth quarter that informed our guide on GMV. First thing, I would say, I'm really pleased with the position we're in and achieving another positive growth in the third quarter around GMV, our second consecutive quarter, while we continue to navigate a very dynamic macro environment. It's really a reflection of the investments that we've continued to make in focused categories in UK and Germany and the horizontal areas, which are continuing to drive health on the overall platform. And as Jamie talked about, our UK C2C proposition launched on the 1st of October, ahead of the holidays and we believe that's going to provide a modest boost to fourth quarter GMV, and we're pleased with the early results so far. Assuming no discernible change in the macro environment, there are a number of one-timers that we've contemplated as we think about the fourth quarter. The first is, obviously, the upcoming US elections. The second is the shorter holiday season with fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And in October, we saw the impacts of Hurricane Milton, which impacted demand, particularly in P&A, in shipping and deliveries. So I firmly believe that our guide balances the strong execution that we've seen year-to-date with the ongoing macro environment that we're expecting and a few of those one-offs, but really pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the business.\nColin Sebastian: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Feather from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nNathan Feather: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. Really encouraging to see the initial guide for positive GMV growth in 2025, I guess, what are the one or two primary things that give you conviction that you've returned back to that sustainable growth area?\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. I think a couple things. One is the momentum that we're seeing across the board in focused categories being at 5% growth here and kind of growing at market rates pretty consistently over the last couple quarters. Combined with the horizontal work that we've been doing, we've now had two quarters of nearly flat. And these are all kind of building blocks, if you will, of the momentum that we're seeing in the underlying business. I talked a little bit about where we are from a buyer's perspective, but we're happy to see exactly what we thought, which was a stabilization and a 1% growth in active buyers. And the other thing is that the investments that we're making in these geos are significant opportunities for expansion in the TAM. When you look at our opportunity in UK and C2C, we think there's a big opportunity to go after really a massive TAM in terms of what people have sitting in their garages, houses, et cetera, is pretty significant. And what we've seen in the past, what we saw with the UK pre-loved fashion and what we saw in Germany is that we're able to bring on new or reactivated sellers onto the platform and then drive that ultimate buyer flywheel. So it's the combination of the momentum that we're seeing, those elements and the new initiatives that we have in place that give us confidence to put out the commentary there about 2025.\nNathan Feather: Great. That's helpful. And then how should we think about the economics of UK managed shipping relative to eBay International shipping? And can you remind us to what extent EIS drove uplift in cross-border transactions? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. It was very helpful for our cross-border trade business, and you see it in some of our cross-border trade numbers, we had an incremental $400 million listings on the platform that were available to be shipped internationally. When you look at our shipping changes, the first thing we're doing is just simplifying shipping on the platform, and that's pretty significant across our markets. But with managed shipping, it radically simplifies the experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay. So historically, when I had to -- let's say, you were shipping a blazer to someone. You'd have to go from all the choices and figure out what you're going to list. And then if there were issues, you had to deal with it as a seller, the buyers on C2C items only really had tracking about 40% of the time. And so through managed shipping, eBay kind of manage all of that for you and really simplifies the experience on the platform. Nearly all buyers will then have tracking information for eligible items. And frankly, this creates a new revenue stream for us, just like with payments and advertising, this is a new opportunity for eBay. So, it's win from an experience standpoint, it's great on generating operating income for the business. But most importantly, it's another tool that unlocks more TAM in C2C. When we've tested this, this is now live in pre-loved fashion in UK managed shipping. Historically, it would have taken 90 seconds to get through that shipping section, and we're seeing sellers get through it under 30 seconds, and so that's really powerful when you think about just taking friction out of the experience for selling. Steve, maybe you can talk a little bit more to the financial implications on managed shipping.\nSteve Priest: Yes. I think as we talked about extensively last year, there's obviously an accounting change associated with EIS and the same applies to managed shipping because we're leaning in we're taking friction off the platform. We're helping our buyers and sellers, and we become the principal. So we recognize the gross revenues and the cost of shipping. You can imagine as a result of the scale of domestic shipping is accretive to operating income -- and that's really the focus that we have in terms of operating income dollars. But because it's domestic in nature and has naturally lower operating margins because of the competitive dynamics, it's more dilutive than the IS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nNikhil Devnani: When you refer to healthier trends in Germany, is that predominantly a top line comment? Or have you been able to improve the profitability of the German business as well now that you've got more activity taking place on your marketplace over there?\nJamie Iannone: Yes, both. When you look at Germany and you look at kind of the trends before we were launching this to where we are now, we're seeing really nice improvement in the business. And you can while we don't break that market out specifically, if you look in the 10-Q, you can see kind of improving revenue trends from that perspective. and exactly what we intended to see is what we're seeing, right, which is that healthier C2C business with a 20% greater CSAT, is driving more new and reactivated sellers on the platform who end up buying more, and that's leading to the healthy trend. When Steve talked about this originally, when we launched it, we quantified this as 10 basis points of impact. And we've been able to re-monetize that business through things like ads, cross-border trades, and we're seeing exactly the flywheel that I talked about from seller to buyer. So we're really pleased with what we saw and what we continue to see with our C2C business in Germany, we're really happy the early results from UK pre-loved fashion, and that gave us the conviction that this was a real winning model to take to our second largest market, where there's some unique dynamics around how the sellers and buyers feel about buyer fees, which makes this a really good opportunity for us to go after incremental TAM.\nNikhil Devnani: Great. Thanks, Jamie. And maybe just a follow-up. You've been talking about improved satisfaction scores, which is a helpful indicator. Now that, you've got several quarters behind you on very marketplace improvements. Can you maybe frame how much GMV conversion rates have improved since you started on this journey? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yeah. Look, you've heard me talk forever about GMV follow CSAT. And I've always said CSATs really the leading indicator there. And if you look case by case, we've seen CSAT increased 20 percentage points in what we did in our early focus categories and categories and look at the trends that we have now on focused growing at 5%. I would say the same exact thing happened in Germany, where we had a 20-point increase in CSAT much, much healthier trends. So what we're doing is not only having an impact on conversion and the health and growth of the business. But it's allowing us to bring on kind of new buyers and new sellers through these efforts, which is helping. The active buyer growth that we're seeing is truly an output of the strategic initiatives that we've been driving and the new and reactivated sellers is not only good for the buying activity, but it's just bringing on more compelling inventory on the platform, which is really good for the long-term health of the business.\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Jamie, perhaps for you. Always a lot of helpful commentary on the business in Europe, but I think China is actually now you're number three market by revenue. I'm wondering if you could just give us an update the business and your customer base there? And maybe for Steve, just quickly, any impact from the sunsetting of the MX payment arrangement? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So, look, our cross-border trade business out of China continues to be strong. It over-indexes to focus categories, our business there. And so it's performing well. Specifically, I would call out parts and accessories has been a really good vector for our cross-border trade business. And we've continued to make that easier for buyers and sellers. So, with our shipping solutions that we've had, we've helped them forward deploy from that perspective. And we've also just made payments a whole lot easier from that perspective. When you think about our relationship with AMEX, we deprecated AMEX in August of last year. And as expected, there was no material impact to our business. As the vast majority of our customers on eBay, they use more than one payment option. So, most customers that were using AMEX were able to migrate to one of our other options like PayPal or Venmo or non-AMEX, debit or credit cards. And we're continuing to focus on launching new ways to pay Takeda to buyers and sellers. We launched River T this quarter. In Germany, 28 million customers, they are used that invoicing solution. They do like 80 million transactions a month, and it was one of those high demand areas for us to bring on to the platform and so we did. So, really pleased between that and the seller cash advance work that we talked about in payments this quarter, really good innovation that we're seeing from that team.\nSteve Priest: Operator, can we do one last question please?\nOperator: Certainly, your final question comes from the line of Michael Morton from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Morton: Thank you for the question. I think probably for Jamie. Following up on Tom's question a bit. Just on the strength that you've seen in parts and accessories, can you break down the key drivers to that for us? Is it the acquisition of [indiscernible] flowing through the user experience now, I guess, like two years later and improving conversion rate around that? And then the second part is what you talked about China sourced inventory seems to skew towards parts and accessories. And it looks like it's most -- is that like -- first question is, is that a big contributor just having more inventory and that helps conversion? And the second one d1 is when you look at it, it appears that a lot of it has been freight forward -- from what we see all of it is straightforward. Do you feel comfortable that, that inventory is insulated from any political changes beta to even happen next week? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes. So, look, I think it's hard to say that there's one thing because we've been working on parts and accessories for a couple of years, and we continue to innovate quarter-after-quarter. What I would tell you is all the work that we've done to increase customer satisfaction there started with the early work that we did in Fitment just in product finders and MyGarage enhancing that whole experience. We now have over 100 million cars in MyGarage, followed by really raising the trust level of what we did with guaranteed fit. I was on with a reporter earlier today, and he talked about buying a new front end for his Toyota Sienna and it fit perfectly and it's going to give him 10 more years. That's an example of just making those two products easier for customers to purchase. The point you called out the breadth of inventory plays a huge role in that. We have over $600 million unique listings in the marketplace and really unique inventory across a number of different segments of buyer enthusiasts. And all of the acquisitions the myFitment has certainly added to the Fitment experience, the work that we've been doing to enhance not just the purchase, but the eventual service. So we launched tire installation a couple of quarters ago, and we launched that first in Germany, and that's been performing well. We just launched parts installations and now you can both buy the part on eBay and have it installed and P&A has really been the largest contributor to growth despite this year, despite lapping really strong that we have in 2023. To your question on the political environment, the majority of our inventory is forward deployed from that perspective. And that's been something that we've been working with our sellers to do to really reduce shipping times and make the overall experience better. So excited by the innovation that we're seeing in P&A, the strength of it and just the continued innovation of making the experience better and better.\nOperator: And this concludes eBay's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and initial thoughts on next year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparison on an organic FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise. eBay delivered strong top and bottom line results in Q3 our focused categories, geo-specific investments from horizontal initiatives drove a second consecutive quarter of positive GMV growth amid an uneven macroeconomic environment. Gross merchandise volume grew over 1% to $18.3 billion. Revenue grew over 3% to $2.58 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6% to $700 million. We delivered $1.19 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 16%, and we returned $881 million to shareholders to be reported on dividend. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume grew over 1% to $18.3 billion on an organic FX-neutral basis. Goldin contributed nearly 30 basis points of total FX-neutral volume growth and foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 30 basis points of spot growth. We continue to face a dynamic macro and consumer spending environment in the quarter. And as we noted on the last earnings call, political news, sporting events and elevated travel in July influenced consumer behavior. Strong execution within our strategic initiatives helped us navigate these headwinds. Focused category GMV grew nearly 5%, approximately five points faster than the remainder of our marketplace. Our momentum in focused categories is broad-based with continued positive growth in P&A, collectibles, refurbished and our luxury categories. The remainder of our marketplace is nearly flat year-over-year for the second straight quarter, driven by craft category shopping, horizontal innovation, geo-specific initiatives and resilient growth in e-commerce. Moving to our trends on a geographic basis. US GMV grew by nearly one point in the third quarter. Similar to Q2, we saw improved trends in organic traffic in the US and continued momentum in focused categories led by collectibles, refurbished and luxury fashion. International GMV grew by nearly 2% on an FX-neutral basis in Q3, while FX was a 0.5 point tailwind spot growth. In the UK and Germany, we continue to navigate more challenging macroeconomic conditions and lower consumer confidence while seeing strength in parts and accessories and improved trends in C2C volume. Cross-border trade continues to be an important driver of international GMV growth, led by exports in Greater China and Japan into our major markets. CBT was also a significant contributor to growth and focused categories, particularly P&L. Next, let's take a look at buyers. Trailing 12 month active buyers grew by nearly 1% to $133 million. Our strategic initiatives and full funnel marketing campaigns help drive continued growth in new and reactivated buyers and improved retention. Buyers were stable at roughly $16 million [indiscernible] buyer grew slightly year-over-year to just over $3,100. Moving to revenue. In Q3, we grew revenue by over 3% to $2.58 billion, foreign exchange was a 30 basis point headwind to spot revenue growth. Our take rate was 14.1% and nearly 20 basis points year-over-year; first-party advertising, shipping and financial services all contributed to our take rate expansion, which was slightly offset by the CTC initiatives and an FX headwind of nearly 10 basis points. On a sequential basis, our take rate expanded by over 10 basis points. Total advertising revenue grew 11% to $408 million in the third quarter and represented over 2.2% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew over 14% to $396 million, and we accelerated modestly from Q2 level. Third-party display ads revenue declined nearly 43% year-over-year as we continue to deprecate these legacy ad units. Next, I'll discuss our profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin was flat year-over-year as a reduction in cost of payments and lower depreciation expenses were roughly offset by traffic acquisition costs, tax related matters and foreign exchange headwind. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by over 80 basis points year-over-year to 27.2% in Q3, driven by operational efficiencies, partly offset by investments in full funnel marketing and a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 20 basis points. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 6% in the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16% to $1.19. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.29 in Q3. The difference was primarily due to an increase in the value of our investment portfolio, partly offset by stock-based compensation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $646 million, down year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes. Last year, the majority of our cash tax payments delays until Q4 due to California's disaster tax release program. At the end of Q3, we had cash and non-equity investments of $5.8 billion and gross debt of $7.4 billion. We repurchased $750 million of eBay shares during Q3 at an average price of approximately $57 and had roughly $1.2 billion remaining under our buyback authorization the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $131 million in September or $0.27 per share. Shifting to our investment portfolio, our equity investments and warrants were valued at $3 billion at the end of the quarter with [indiscernible], Adevinta and G-Market accounted for majority of the value. We retained approximately 18% ownership of Adevinta, which is a privatized ad event entity, and that ownership is valued at roughly $1.9 billion based on the value as at the close of the transaction. The consortium led by Permira and Blackstone as the option through November 29th to purchase from eBay roughly 10% ownership of the private entity for just over $1 billion. Our adding warrants were valued at approximately $0.5 billion at the end of Q3. On October 15th, we met the processing volume milestone necessary to invest the second tranche of our Adevinta. We subsequently paid $105 million to exercise the chance for approximately 404,000 shares of Adevinta stock, which are valued at approximately $602 million based on the company's share price at the time. Turning to our outlook. We expect to generate GMV between $18.9 billion and $19.3 billion in the fourth quarter, representing FX-neutral growth between flat from 2% year-over-year. We expect Goldin to contribute over 30 basis points of GMV growth in the quarter. At current rates, foreign currency would represent a roughly two-point tailwind to GMV growth in Q4. We expect continued momentum in GMV to be driven by multiple strategic initiatives across focused categories, the UK and Germany and horizontal areas. Our outlook also contemplates a challenging operating environment due to persistent economic headwinds and several one-off dynamics in Q4, secifically greater consumer attention on US elections, a shorter holiday shopping period this year from Hurricane Milton in early October the forecast revenue between $2.53 billion and $2.59 billion in the fourth quarter, representing FX-neutral growth of negative 1% to positive 1%. At current rates, we estimate FX would represent a nearly 30 basis point tailwind to spot revenue growth. We anticipate our UK C2C initiative will modestly benefit total GMV growth in Q4. While certain existing levers like advertising, cross-border fees, and our sell-to-buy flywheel to continue to contribute revenue on UK C2C volume. We do not expect material revenue contribution in Q4 from our two major remonetization efforts. Managed shipping, which is ramping starting in Q4 through Q1 of 2025 and Biofeedback, which we plan to introduce in the back half of Q1. We launched our UK initiative in October to provide the best experience for our sellers and buyers and our second largest market ahead of the critical holiday season. We also believe it is the right decision to phase in this new monetization program to give our customers time to adjust to changes. For Q4, we forecast non-GAAP operating margin between 26.5% and 27%. In addition to pressure from our UK initiative, expenses related to M&A and integration costs and over 30 basis points of impact to our consolidated operating margin and foreign currency is another 60 basis points of headwind year-over-year. For the full year, this implies 60 to 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.17 and $1.22 in the fourth quarter, representing year-over-year growth between 9% and 14%. This implies full year non-GAAP EPS growth between 13% and 14%. We forecast capital expenditure to be about 4.5% of revenue for the full year, and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We continue to expect free cash flow of just under $2 billion for the full year. We are further raising our share repurchase target for 2024 to $3 billion, implying $750 million of repurchase during Q4. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. Now, I'd like to make a few initial comments on our financial priorities for 2025. We plan to balance the need to reinvest for long-term growth against the near-term top and bottom line performance. Assuming an unchanged macro environment, we are planning our business to run positive FX-neutral GMV and revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income dollar growth modestly ahead of GMV and high single-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share year-over-year. As it pertains to margins, we plan to target the optimal combination of GMV growth and operating margin to maximize operating income dollar growth. There were some unique considerations for 2025, influencing our financial architecture. Similar to eBay International shipping program, our managed shipping initiative in the U. we recognize revenue on a gross basis. Our current assumption is that UK managed shipping will pressure our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 40 basis points in 2025, while contributing positively to operating income dollars. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. Our GMV grew for a second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 16%. These results clearly demonstrate that our strategy is working, we have the right balance between delivering robust standing, reinvesting to drive long-term sustainable growth and delivering healthy capital returns to shareholders. We plan to follow these same principles and build on this year's momentum as we finalize our plans for 2025. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Hi, Justin. Good to speak this afternoon. Obviously, we provided a fair bit of color on our 2025 architecture in the prepared remarks and believe this is a really robust financial outlook for 2025 and the continuation of the progress that we've continued to make this year. We're not going to provide any more specific precise guidance around take rate at this point, because we're finalizing our budgets. But I can talk to a few factors that you can consider for 2025. The first one is on shipping. Obviously, Jamie just elaborated on our UK C2C initiative. UK is our second largest market by volume and has a higher C2C penetration in Germany. And while there's this near-term impact on take rate as we eliminated final value fees for sellers, we will be monetizing that through the managed shipping, which is ramping now and will continue into the first quarter and the buyer fees, which is planned for the back half of Q1. The second item is really around advertising and financial services. We do expect advertising to continue to grow faster than GMV, driven by the momentum in first-party promoted listings and off-site ads and obviously, the improved seller experience that's coming from that. And to a lesser extent, we do expect some incremental revenue associated to financial services as we get into 2025. Hi, Colin, just with regards to our assumptions in the fourth quarter that informed our guide on GMV. First thing, I would say, I'm really pleased with the position we're in and achieving another positive growth in the third quarter around GMV, our second consecutive quarter, while we continue to navigate a very dynamic macro environment. It's really a reflection of the investments that we've continued to make in focused categories in UK and Germany and the horizontal areas, which are continuing to drive health on the overall platform. And as Jamie talked about, our UK C2C proposition launched on the 1st of October, ahead of the holidays and we believe that's going to provide a modest boost to fourth quarter GMV, and we're pleased with the early results so far. Assuming no discernible change in the macro environment, there are a number of one-timers that we've contemplated as we think about the fourth quarter. The first is, obviously, the upcoming US elections. The second is the shorter holiday season with fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And in October, we saw the impacts of Hurricane Milton, which impacted demand, particularly in P&A, in shipping and deliveries. So I firmly believe that our guide balances the strong execution that we've seen year-to-date with the ongoing macro environment that we're expecting and a few of those one-offs, but really pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the business. Yes. I think as we talked about extensively last year, there's obviously an accounting change associated with EIS and the same applies to managed shipping because we're leaning in we're taking friction off the platform. We're helping our buyers and sellers, and we become the principal. So we recognize the gross revenues and the cost of shipping. You can imagine as a result of the scale of domestic shipping is accretive to operating income -- and that's really the focus that we have in terms of operating income dollars. But because it's domestic in nature and has naturally lower operating margins because of the competitive dynamics, it's more dilutive than the IS. Operator, can we do one last question please?"

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay as our gross merchandise volume grew by over 1% to $18.3 billion, marking our second straight quarter of positive GMV growth. Revenue increased by more than 3% to $2.58 billion. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6% and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 16% to $1.19. Now let's turn to the key drivers of our Q3 results. Our focused categories continue to deliver relevant experiences to customers and drive growth for our overall marketplace. Focus category GMV grew by nearly 5% in Q3, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by approximately five points. This growth was driven by broad-based momentum across motors, parts and accessories, collectibles, refurbished and our luxury fashion categories. Collectibles had a particularly strong quarter as trading GMV accelerated to double-digit growth in Q3, driven by strength in sports trading cards and collectible card gains both on the eBay platform and through our subsidiary, TCGplayer. During Q3, we engaged with Collectibles enthusiasts at key industry trade shows including the National Sports Collectors Convention, GenCon and San Diego, Cometa. We expanded our high ASP inventory through monthly marquee auctions and consignment from trusted partners like TSA and ComC. And we continue to scale and evolve the eBay live experience, fueling particular momentum in areas like trading card case break. On top healthy organic momentum, our recent acquisition Goldin is opening up exciting opportunities in the collectibles world. Just last week, Ken Goldin and team completed a record sales for Shohei Ohtani's 50th homerun ball, which sold for nearly $4.4 million, making it the most valuable baseball ever sold. Auctions for truly one-of-a-kind items like this can generate a lot of awareness for our platform where hobbyists can shop for everything ranging from low ASP ungraded trading cards to some of the world's most valuable collectible items. Fashion is also a critical entry point for us. As nearly one in five new sellers and buyers come to eBay through fashion category. During Q3, we launched a new creative campaign called Things People Love to raise awareness of eBay's value proposition in pre-love fashion. We focused on driving relevance with key audiences like GenZ by highlighting eBay's breadth and depth of quality pre-loved inventory backed by truck. Our full funnel marketing strategy has been instrumental in driving continued momentum in focused categories and healthier trends in active buyers, which grew nearly 1% to $133 million in Q3. One of the key building blocks underpinning our return to positive GMV growth has been our geo-specific investment, where we leverage our innovation playbook from focused categories to better serve customer needs at the local level. While many of these product experience changes benefit all sellers and buyers, we are particularly focused on consumer-to-consumer or C2C sellers for several reasons. C2C sellers bring some of the most unique inventory to eBay and are typically less price sensitive than B2C sellers. C2C sellers accelerate e-commerce as roughly 60% of their GMV comes from used and refurbished items compared to 40% for our marketplace overall. Selling on eBay also creates a flywheel effect that stimulates incremental GMV as buyers who sell purchased roughly twice as much on eBay as non-sellers with most of their incremental spend supporting small businesses. As a reminder, our first major geo-specific initiative launched in Germany in March of 2023, and more than 18 months later, we continue to see significantly higher customer satisfaction or CSAT and improved GMV trends for the overall German market. This past April, we rolled out significant enhancements in the UK for pre-owned apparel categories. These improvements included simplified tools for selling and new tools to drive demand through enhanced discovery like Explore and Shop the look. Since then, we have observed material improvements to key C2C metrics like CSAT and active sellers alongside a double-digit improvement in C2C GMV growth in pre-owned apparel versus our prior baseline. The success of our Germany initiative over the last 1.5 years and similar results in the UK over the last six months gave us the confidence to move forward with a significant expansion of our UK initiative earlier this month. We introduced a suite of new capabilities to upgrade the overall C2C experience in UK, including a simplified native listing flow, managed shipping, which streamlines the domestic shipping experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay, improved local pickup and discovery capabilities and eBay balance, which allows UK sellers to store their earnings or use them as spendable funds on eBay. We accompanied this future rollout with a full funnel marketing campaign in the UK, which highlights the ease of selling on eBay. We also eliminated final value fees and regulatory operating keys for UK C2C sellers across all categories, excluding motor vehicles. We made this change due to clear evidence that European consumers are more motivated to lift their items online when it's free to sell even when buyer fees are introduced. We believe reducing the friction to sell will unlock a significantly larger total addressable market, or TAM, in C2C. We will initially monetize our UK C2C volume in several ways, including advertising, cross-border fees and our sell-to-buy flywheel. In Q4, we will begin to ramp our managed shipping initiative in the UK. We also plan introduce a buyer-facing fee on UK's C2C transactions during Q1 of 2025. Next, I'll walk through some of the major enhancements to the UK experience. One of the most significant changes we launched in October was the horizontal rollout of a simplified native listing flow for UK C2C sellers. This experience dramatically reduces the number of steps and decision points for sellers, offers intelligent pricing recommendations, seamlessly integrates AI-generated descriptions and photo enhancements and better highlights the benefits of advertising. Since launch, the simplified flow has notably decreased time to list, improved listing completion rates, increased conversion, sold items and GMV per listing attempt and elevated adoption of promoted listings. With managed shipping, we are completely overhauling our shipping experience for C2C sellers in the UK in two phases. The first phase completed in early October, extended the simplified shipping experience we first rolled out in pre-owned apparel to all categories. Within the new native listing flow, UK C2C sellers now see a consolidated list of shipping options based on the estimated package size and weight. And since implementing this change, we have observed a significant reduction in time spent on shipping in a listing flow. The second phase of managed shipping; radically simplifies the experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay. Similar to managed payments and eBay international shipping, Managed shipping leverages our scale and expertise to create a better experience for customers while generating incremental revenue and operating income dollars. When listing eligible products sellers simply confirm the pre-selected package size and eBay handles the rest. Buyers received competitive shipping rates and sellers are fully protected against loss or damage. Managed shipping is currently live for C2C pre-owned apparel listing in the UK. In Q4, we plan to expand managed shipping horizontally on an opt-out basis, before mandating the program for eligible items listed by U.C2C sellers during Q1 of 2025. In addition to shipping, we launched a number of enhancements to the local pickup experience in the UK. As these transactions make up a significant portion of our C2C TAM in this market, we increased local supply by defaulting new C2C listings to offer both pickup and shipping options. We created a new eBay local landing page and map view for optimal browsing of nearby inventory. We also enhance trust, improve post-sale education for shoppers and streamline the in-person payment process. Since launch, we've seen a significant uptick in locally enabled listings in the UK and a double-digit improvement in local C2C volume growth. Lastly, in mid-October, we added the eBay balance feature in the UK. This gives millions of C2C sellers the flexibility to use their earnings to shop on eBay, promote their listings, purchase shipping labels or withdrawal available funds whenever they wish. With eBay balance, we believe we can further stimulate the cell to buy flywheel and also reduce the cost of payments when sellers spend their earnings on eBay. Taking a step back by making these changes, we believe we are addressing three of the longest-standing pain points for UK sellers on eBay. These delist the amount of time and effort it takes to create a listing and the complexities involved with shipping. During the first few weeks since the broader UK C2C initiative launch, we've seen more than 20-point increases in new and reactivated listers and sellers and material increases in C2C sold items and GMV. We are confident that these changes will not only be great for our community, but also our shareholders. Our strategic focus on C2C should open up a significantly larger TAM in e-commerce by unlocking consumers' closets, basements and garages. Our teams continue to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to deliver magical innovations for our customers. In recent months, eBay's core AI team released the second generation of our proprietary LiLiuM series of large language models, developed in-house using our high-performance supercomputer. Notably, these models have outperformed public benchmarks in eBay specific tasks like description generation, title creation, aspect extraction and pricing predictions. Behind the scenes, these models have already been deployed to accelerate the transformation of selling and buying on eBay, including magical listing. The first phase of our magic listing experience generates high-quality listing descriptions with the push of a button. Approximately 10 million unique sellers have used this feature to date, creating over 100 million listings. GenAI enhanced listings have also generated several billion dollars of cumulative GMV on eBay. Additionally, more than one-quarter of US mobile app users have access to the next iteration of magic listing and beta. After taking or uploading a photo, this experience leverages computer vision and generative AI to pre--fill or suggest the title, category, description and other item aspects for listing. This app for this beta remains extremely high at roughly 90% as we continue to optimize model performance and efficiency. We are also leveraging GenAI to enhance our tools for our B2C sellers, we recently introduced the magical bulk listing tool, which leverages our internal LLM to seamlessly create a large number of pre-populated listings at one. Sellers simply uploads photos in bulk and individual listings are created with category, title and item specifics pre-filled where possible. The magical bulk listing tool was launched for all B2C US trading card sellers in Q3 and early feedback has been extremely positive. In Q4, we've also begun to roll out this tool to sellers in other categories. Turning next to advertising. During Q3, first-party advertising grew 14% and while total ad revenue grew 11% to $408 million and eclipse 2.2% penetration of GMV. Nearly 3.2 million sellers adopted a single ad product during the quarter, and we ended Q3 with over $1 billion live promoted listings out of more than $2.1 billion total live listings. Within the ads portfolio, Promoted Listings were the largest contributor to year-over-year growth led by cost per click ad unit. Promoted offsite ads were the fastest growing among our first-party ads. And during the quarter, we rolled out several performance optimizations and scaled our go-to-market efforts for these ads, raising awareness, adoption and retention amongst our seller base. Promoted stores ads are the most nascent product in our portfolio. But during Q3, we began to gradually ramp these ads through contextually relevant placements at the top of search and on the new order details page. Next, I'd like to discuss our work in payments and financial services, where we continue to expand choice and flexibility for buyers, and offer new solutions for sellers to grow their businesses on eBay. In Germany, we are expanding our breadth of payment options through our partnership with Riverty, a German Fintech company offering solutions used by 28 million consumers. We are introducing a monthly invoice payment option through Riverty, enabling German buyers to pay for multiple purchases on eBay at a later date with no interest or fees if the payment is made on time. According to an eBay consumer survey, more than three-quarter of online shoppers in Germany prefer to use invoicing as a payment method for online shopping. So we are pleased to offer another locally relevant payment option for our customers in this region. For small business sellers, we continue to expand the eBay seller capital program through trusted partners. In July, we launched Business Cash Advance, a revenue-based financing solution provided by Liberis. In October, we expanded our partnership with Liberis to offer flexible cash advances to US sellers. This program offers financing for sums of up to $2 million with the flexibility for sellers to tap into capital on demand and a lot more financing over time. I am pleased to share that through these programs with Liberis, we have already enabled thousands of small business seller's access to over $40 million of growth capital. And in aggregate, across all of our seller capital partnership, we've connected eBay sellers with over $100 million of working capital year-to-date. Next, I'd like to share a few ways we're making an impact in our community. eBay for Charity raised more than $49 million in Q3, up 21% year-over-year. Additionally, the eBay Foundation awarded nearly $3 million to Grand Teas across the globe who are supporting entrepreneurship for historically excluded groups. I'm always amazed by the generosity of our buyers and sellers, and I'm proud we're able to support important causes around the world. In closing, Q3 was another strong quarter for eBay. We sustained positive GMV growth for the second straight quarter, amid a dynamic macro and operating environment, led by nearly 5% growth in our focus categories. The rest of our marketplace was nearly flat for the second consecutive quarter, supported by horizontal innovation and our C2C investments in key geographies. We continue to see strong growth in our first-party ad products across portfolio and broaden our range of payments and financial service offerings for sellers and buyers. And importantly, we remain focused on operational discipline alongside our investments in long-term growth initiatives to ensure continued healthy growth in operating income and earnings per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over you. Yeah. Look, we're launching this from a position of strength. Let me tell you how we're thinking about it. We've delivered positive GMV growth in the past two quarters. And we have strong conviction. We started 1.5 years ago in Germany and saw really strong results there. And our early results in preowned apparel in the U.K. give us the confidence to move forward. We made the decision to launch this in October 1 to really take advantage of the holiday period in our second largest market. We believe it's the right decision to phase this in for our sellers and buyers, because the other thing you've got to remember here, Ygal, is just it's a change to the marketplace, and we want to give sellers and buyers time to adjust their processes. So that's why we're going to ramp up managed shipping through Q4 and Q1. And why we decided to introduce the buyer fees in the back half of Q1. So the pressure that you're seeing on revenue in Q4 is primarily a timing dynamic given that ramp of managed shipping over Q4 and through Q1. And then introducing the buyer fee in the back half of Q1, so some of that remonetization lag will likely spill over to Q1. But we believe that these changes are clear, we believe based on where buyer fees are in the UK, we have the ability to remonetize these moving those fees around. And remember, it's not just those two, but it's also advertising. It's the cross-border fees that we charge, because as well as the seller buyer flywheel that we see. But the strategic benefits of doing this are really clear. We're going to unlock a significant portion of TAM in our second largest market and ultimately generate long-term growth for eBay and value for our shareholders. And as Steve said, Steve gave some preliminary commentary on FY 2025. And as we expect to grow GMV and revenue year-on-year, grew operating income modestly faster than GMV and increased our EPS by high single digits year-over-year. To your question on the US, we have no plans to launch free selling in the US. US is a different market from the UK. UK buyers and sellers are more open to buyer fees. It's more standard in the market. There may be certain aspects of the product experience that streamlined selling that we bring to other markets. And as you know, we look at each market in categories and think about the specifics of what the optimal set of initiatives to unlock more supply and demand for that specific market. Yeah, we are. It's been really great to see how sellers and buyers have responded to this. In that new model, we're outperforming the public benchmarks on things like descriptions, titles, aspect, we've seen a better job at precision pricing, increasing by double digits through these new models that we have on the platform. And what's great about the AI that we're launching is it's having a major impact at scale. So if I look at it just since we've launched these tools, over 10 million sellers have taken advantage of it, and over 100 million listings have adopted it. And cumulatively, we've generated several billion dollars of cumulative GMV from GenAI enhanced listing since launch. And we're still continuing to ramp up, improve the models, expose more and more people to Magical listings. So I feel really good about it. The other thing is we saw some demand from our small business and our B2C sellers, to have access to the tools that we have built. So this quarter, we launched Magical Bulk listings. And essentially, what that does is if I'm a business seller, let's say, I've got 25 watches or trading cards that I want to list, I can just upload a couple of photos of each and will, in the background, use our large language model and the product knowledge graph to fill in all the description, title and aspect information for those using that same technology that we built for single listings to do bulk listing. So still early stages, but really excited by the performance of what we're seeing in AI. Yeah. So I'll start with the first one and then Steve will talk about the take rate. So on focused categories, yeah, look, another solid quarter. We delivered 5% growth, parts and accessories continues to be a big growth driver of our focus categories. But we saw some momentum in other areas, specifically, I'd talk about collectibles. We saw double-digit growth in collectibles this quarter. You've probably been seeing a number of the things that we were doing, but the combination of work that we're doing with TCGplayer, our Goldin, which is Goldin provides some of the world's most desirable inventory that's out there on the marketplace. If you're on Goldin right now, you see that we're doing Luke Homes and Eric Church are doing, raising money for the Carolinas, and that's all being driven by our family at Goldin, and then when you look at trading cards in particular, we've had this healthy run rate off of it, I said, as double-digit growth, really based on all of the innovations that we've done over time, like my collections, price guides, authentication, but also the grading partnership that we put in place with PSA, where now instead of sending an item into be graded and describe it on the way into grading and then getting it back and then listing it again on eBay then having to shift it to the buyer. That's all one seamless process now where I just ship it to PSA and it gets sold. So we're really seeing strength across the board in all of our focus categories. Refurbished continues to do well in this marketplace where people are -- consumers are challenged. And our luxury has also been contributing positively to year-over-year growth for the eighth straight quarter. So the work that we're doing with our new authentication center is there. So we have lots of momentum in our focus categories. We continue to expand the work we've done there. And I'm also just excited because the work that we've done for focused categories by verticals, we've been able to apply these geo-specific areas to C2C to great effect. I mean if you look at Germany, for example, we increased our C2C seller CSAT by 20 percentage points. And that's led to a real change in trajectory of our German business versus the prior baseline. So we will continue to push forward with our strategy, and we like what we're seeing. Yeah. As you know, Lee, we don't preannounce kind of anything that we're doing on focus categories for competitive reasons. I will say we have five categories that are over $10 billion on eBay, fashion, home and garden, collectibles, electronics and motors, parts and accessories. And so it shows you the breadth of what we have on there. We did purposely take some of the playbook that we've had going against verticals and put it against goes to great effect, and we really like the ROI that we've seen against that. The second thing I would say is that the horizontal investments that we've been making to drive our core categories have been really beneficial. And that's because of all of the generative AI capabilities we've been able to apply, those help both our focus categories but also in our core categories. And it's the second quarter in a row where we've had nearly flat growth in our core categories. To your question on collectibles business and competitive positioning, we feel great about the innovation that we're driving quarter after quarter from that standpoint. I mentioned this quarter as a very scaled player in the market. We continue to see double-digit growth in trading cards. We put together a really nice collection of assets. When you think about from TCGplayer in collectible card games to what we do on eBay to now Goldin, we sell everything from ungraded trading cards to the highest value products in hobby. And that's valuable, because collectors are generally looking kind of across that span to do so, and all the innovation that we've been driving in that category with collections, price guides, authentication, products that we've launched with TSA this new partnership that we've put in place with collectors. I mean, just think about it, all the things that we've been innovating are the exact things that collectors have asked us to do for years. They've asked us to say, make it easy for us to send a card in for grading and sell it on eBay. And now that's really seamless, and the CSAT on that is very, very high. When you look at the innovation that we're driving in eBay Live, we've done more and more case breaks every single quarter and added new capabilities there. We recently added last quarter, the ability to do buy spot, which is essentially to purchase your favorite team and track that through a case breaks and we continue to grow it. And the last thing I'd say is that, look, we've had had and we still have incredible relationships with top collectible sellers and we've always been a champion of the hobby shop. It's why we did TCGplayer deal. And we believe in open marketplace where enthusiasts can buy and sell the things that they love. Yeah. Great question, Colin. So first off, absolutely, we see that converting into buyers and enthusiast buyers. You'll note that this quarter, we were up 1% in our active buyer count to $133 million, and while that's not a core KPI of it is an output of the strategy and the strategic initiatives that we've been driving and a healthy buyer funnel is important to our growth in enthusiast buyers. When you look specifically at the C2C initiative that we did in Germany and that we're talking about in the UK, it's great for the buying perspective for a couple of reasons. First is when we convert a buyer into seller, they become at least twice as valuable as a buyer as previously on the platform. And that's really great for buying. The second thing is C2C has really -- I call it the inventory goal on the platform. In general, they're bringing on things that aren't sold by a B2C seller or by a small business, think about all the stuff that you have around the house, that's not available from a B2C seller. And so when I look at the overall platform, we're about 40% used to refurbish, but in our C2C sellers, it's 60%. And so that unique inventory drives demand. It drives demand amid enthusiast buyers who find that part or that card or that thing they couldn't otherwise find on eBay. And the other great thing is that a little over three-quarters of our volume is B2C, but the vast majority of our sellers is C2C. And so what you see happening there is that, that flywheel of those C2C buying more from -- once they become buyers, actually, the majority of that new purchasing goes to small businesses and B2C sellers. So B2C sellers win as well from that increased buying activity on the platform. And that's why we really like the synergy of what we're seeing overall. It's why when we look at the trends in our German business, they're much healthier than before we made these changes. And we're excited both for what it does for sellers, but importantly, the demand that it drives for buyers. You'll also see across all of our markets, a new marketing campaign that's called Things People Love. And I think we had a link in the slide deck to show you some of the creative, but I'm really excited by the storytelling, because there's both a buying message in there but also a selling message about unlocking what's in your closet, your garage, your basement, and that's really healthy for us to drive that new initiative, and it's extremely well done, and it tested well. I'm excited for those campaigns. Yeah. I think a couple things. One is the momentum that we're seeing across the board in focused categories being at 5% growth here and kind of growing at market rates pretty consistently over the last couple quarters. Combined with the horizontal work that we've been doing, we've now had two quarters of nearly flat. And these are all kind of building blocks, if you will, of the momentum that we're seeing in the underlying business. I talked a little bit about where we are from a buyer's perspective, but we're happy to see exactly what we thought, which was a stabilization and a 1% growth in active buyers. And the other thing is that the investments that we're making in these geos are significant opportunities for expansion in the TAM. When you look at our opportunity in UK and C2C, we think there's a big opportunity to go after really a massive TAM in terms of what people have sitting in their garages, houses, et cetera, is pretty significant. And what we've seen in the past, what we saw with the UK pre-loved fashion and what we saw in Germany is that we're able to bring on new or reactivated sellers onto the platform and then drive that ultimate buyer flywheel. So it's the combination of the momentum that we're seeing, those elements and the new initiatives that we have in place that give us confidence to put out the commentary there about 2025. Yeah. It was very helpful for our cross-border trade business, and you see it in some of our cross-border trade numbers, we had an incremental $400 million listings on the platform that were available to be shipped internationally. When you look at our shipping changes, the first thing we're doing is just simplifying shipping on the platform, and that's pretty significant across our markets. But with managed shipping, it radically simplifies the experience and creates a new revenue stream for eBay. So historically, when I had to -- let's say, you were shipping a blazer to someone. You'd have to go from all the choices and figure out what you're going to list. And then if there were issues, you had to deal with it as a seller, the buyers on C2C items only really had tracking about 40% of the time. And so through managed shipping, eBay kind of manage all of that for you and really simplifies the experience on the platform. Nearly all buyers will then have tracking information for eligible items. And frankly, this creates a new revenue stream for us, just like with payments and advertising, this is a new opportunity for eBay. So, it's win from an experience standpoint, it's great on generating operating income for the business. But most importantly, it's another tool that unlocks more TAM in C2C. When we've tested this, this is now live in pre-loved fashion in UK managed shipping. Historically, it would have taken 90 seconds to get through that shipping section, and we're seeing sellers get through it under 30 seconds, and so that's really powerful when you think about just taking friction out of the experience for selling. Steve, maybe you can talk a little bit more to the financial implications on managed shipping. Yes, both. When you look at Germany and you look at kind of the trends before we were launching this to where we are now, we're seeing really nice improvement in the business. And you can while we don't break that market out specifically, if you look in the 10-Q, you can see kind of improving revenue trends from that perspective. and exactly what we intended to see is what we're seeing, right, which is that healthier C2C business with a 20% greater CSAT, is driving more new and reactivated sellers on the platform who end up buying more, and that's leading to the healthy trend. When Steve talked about this originally, when we launched it, we quantified this as 10 basis points of impact. And we've been able to re-monetize that business through things like ads, cross-border trades, and we're seeing exactly the flywheel that I talked about from seller to buyer. So we're really pleased with what we saw and what we continue to see with our C2C business in Germany, we're really happy the early results from UK pre-loved fashion, and that gave us the conviction that this was a real winning model to take to our second largest market, where there's some unique dynamics around how the sellers and buyers feel about buyer fees, which makes this a really good opportunity for us to go after incremental TAM. Yeah. Look, you've heard me talk forever about GMV follow CSAT. And I've always said CSATs really the leading indicator there. And if you look case by case, we've seen CSAT increased 20 percentage points in what we did in our early focus categories and categories and look at the trends that we have now on focused growing at 5%. I would say the same exact thing happened in Germany, where we had a 20-point increase in CSAT much, much healthier trends. So what we're doing is not only having an impact on conversion and the health and growth of the business. But it's allowing us to bring on kind of new buyers and new sellers through these efforts, which is helping. The active buyer growth that we're seeing is truly an output of the strategic initiatives that we've been driving and the new and reactivated sellers is not only good for the buying activity, but it's just bringing on more compelling inventory on the platform, which is really good for the long-term health of the business. Yes. So, look, our cross-border trade business out of China continues to be strong. It over-indexes to focus categories, our business there. And so it's performing well. Specifically, I would call out parts and accessories has been a really good vector for our cross-border trade business. And we've continued to make that easier for buyers and sellers. So, with our shipping solutions that we've had, we've helped them forward deploy from that perspective. And we've also just made payments a whole lot easier from that perspective. When you think about our relationship with AMEX, we deprecated AMEX in August of last year. And as expected, there was no material impact to our business. As the vast majority of our customers on eBay, they use more than one payment option. So, most customers that were using AMEX were able to migrate to one of our other options like PayPal or Venmo or non-AMEX, debit or credit cards. And we're continuing to focus on launching new ways to pay Takeda to buyers and sellers. We launched River T this quarter. In Germany, 28 million customers, they are used that invoicing solution. They do like 80 million transactions a month, and it was one of those high demand areas for us to bring on to the platform and so we did. So, really pleased between that and the seller cash advance work that we talked about in payments this quarter, really good innovation that we're seeing from that team. Yes. So, look, I think it's hard to say that there's one thing because we've been working on parts and accessories for a couple of years, and we continue to innovate quarter-after-quarter. What I would tell you is all the work that we've done to increase customer satisfaction there started with the early work that we did in Fitment just in product finders and MyGarage enhancing that whole experience. We now have over 100 million cars in MyGarage, followed by really raising the trust level of what we did with guaranteed fit. I was on with a reporter earlier today, and he talked about buying a new front end for his Toyota Sienna and it fit perfectly and it's going to give him 10 more years. That's an example of just making those two products easier for customers to purchase. The point you called out the breadth of inventory plays a huge role in that. We have over $600 million unique listings in the marketplace and really unique inventory across a number of different segments of buyer enthusiasts. And all of the acquisitions the myFitment has certainly added to the Fitment experience, the work that we've been doing to enhance not just the purchase, but the eventual service. So we launched tire installation a couple of quarters ago, and we launched that first in Germany, and that's been performing well. We just launched parts installations and now you can both buy the part on eBay and have it installed and P&A has really been the largest contributor to growth despite this year, despite lapping really strong that we have in 2023. To your question on the political environment, the majority of our inventory is forward deployed from that perspective. And that's been something that we've been working with our sellers to do to really reduce shipping times and make the overall experience better. So excited by the innovation that we're seeing in P&A, the strength of it and just the continued innovation of making the experience better and better."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie.\nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our strong Q2 results marked a notable step toward our goal of achieving sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. Our gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion in Q2. Revenue increased 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin rose by 1.0% to 27.9%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share rose by approximately 15% to $1.18. And we've turned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends during the quarter. I'm proud of our teams for delivering these results amid continued macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, and an evolving regulatory landscape. Now let's walk through some of the key drivers of our Q2 results. Focus category GMV grew by over 4% in Q2, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 5 points. After Motors Parts & Accessories, or P&A, which continued its trend of healthy growth, collectibles was the second largest contributor to GMV growth among focus categories in Q2. In mid-May, we closed a series of transactions with Collectors, parent company of PSA, and a leading provider of authentication and grading services for collectibles. Since then, we've made significant progress toward integrating Goldin, expanding our relationship with PSA, and elevating the eBay collectibles experience. We support the latest Goldin 100 auction, help drive awareness for the successful global premiere of King of Collectibles Season 2 on Netflix, and the Goldin team began hosting events on eBay Live. During Q2, we completed the transfer of trading card assets to the PSA vault ahead of schedule, and all PSA customers can now easily sell on eBay at the time of grading without having their cards shipped back to them. Since going live in late June, the PSA storefront has already sold tens of thousands of trading cards on eBay, and I'm excited for our companies to jointly drive innovation on behalf of hobbyists for years to come. eBay refurbished was also a significant contributor to GMV growth and was our fastest growing focus category year-over-year, as our combination of trust, value and quality continues to resonate with customers. Our selection of refurbished inventory continues to grow as we expand existing partnerships with OEMs like Dyson, onboard CVT sellers with access to unique items, and extend the program to new categories. During Q2, we expanded eBay refurbished to golf clubs, bringing warranties and hassle-free returns to thousands of previously owned golf clubs from the world's top brands. In June, we announced a sustainability collaboration with Seagate, a global leader in data storage solutions. We launched Seagate's official storefront on eBay for direct sales of factory-recertified hard drives. Not only are these refurbished products of great value for consumers, but this partnership can also eliminate a significant amount of e-waste by extending the product life cycles of quality hard drives. Consumers' desire to shop sustainably has also benefited our luxury focus categories, which delivered positive year-over-year GMV growth for the sixth straight quarter. As we acquire more sellers with well-priced luxury inventory, we\u2019ve observed a strong correlation with incremental GMV. For instance, we saw a significant acceleration in cross-border demand after the opening of our Tokyo Authentication Center, which led to a meaningful expansion of our luxury handbag inventory. We reached a major milestone for our Authenticity Guarantee Program in Q2. We authenticated our 10th million item since the inception of the program in 2024. A pair of Air Jordan 1 Low Lucky Green sneakers, authenticated in our Las Vegas facility. During Q2, we also introduced optional authentication for luxury handbags priced between $200 and $500 in the U.S., which enables even more buyers and sellers to enjoy the benefits of our Authenticity Guaranteed Program. As our value proposition continues to grow, it's been exciting to see how partnerships have enabled eBay to show up in so many culturally relevant moments recently. These opportunities help us to evolve perceptions of eBay by showcasing our modernized experiences and connect with more enthusiasts shopping in pursuits of their passion. Just in the last quarter, La La Anthony, a Madeleine [ph] client showcased their pre-loved luxury accessories from eBay on the Met Gala red carpet. We saw eBay logos in the cockpits of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri as the McLaren Formula 1 team took the checkered flag at the Miami Grand Prix. We partnered with Disney to create a customized destination for May the 4th, enabling us to engage with Star Wars enthusiasts around the world as they explored the more than 1 million Star Wars-related collectible products on eBay. And in June, eBay returned as the headline sponsor for Love Island in the U.K., showcasing the power of pre-loved fashion to millions of households nationwide. Next, I'd like to update you on some of the geospecific investments we've been making. In March of 2023, we repurposed our strategic playbook for focus categories to better serve the needs of German consumers. This endeavor has reinvigorated our C2C business in Germany and helped us navigate challenging economic conditions in the region. In Q2, we sustained positive year-over-year growth in C2C volume in Germany as we lapped the full first quarter of this initiative. Healthier C2C trends have also supported our B2C business in the German market. The unique inventory listed by consumer sellers has led to a healthier customer acquisition funnel. When consumers begin selling, they also purchase twice as much on eBay as non-sellers, on average, with most of that incremental volume benefiting B2C sellers. The success of the German initiative influenced our decision to invest in an improved experience for pre-owned apparel in the U.K last quarter. These changes, including a new selling flow that makes it considerably easier to list on eBay, with image guidance, simpler item aspect collection, and a streamlined shipping module with a focused set of couriers and parameters. For buyers, we introduced optimized vertical browsing pages for fashion and new generative AI-powered buying experiences like Shop the Look and Explore. Although we're only a few months in, we're seeing positive leading indicators in the strategically important category. For users of the new selling flow, we have observed a 20 point increase in CSAT, a material reduction in average listing time, and an increase in listings and sold items per seller. A growing number of buyers have engaged with our new AI-powered fashion shopping features and are eagerly awaiting the enhanced personalization and filtering we plan to bring to shop the look and explore in the coming months. These shopping experiences are emblematic of the overall acceleration in the pace of innovation at eBay. Our investments in generative AI and machine learning are simplifying the selling and buying experiences, making our marketplace more efficient and helping us better serve customers at all phases of their shopping journey. To power these experiences, our core AI team is training and fine-tuning large language models using eBay's proprietary data to build even more magical innovations for customers. In Q2, we entered the high-performance computing realm by deploying our first supercomputer, which gave us the capacity to build and fine-tune even larger LLMs on trillions of tokens. Based on publicly available performance benchmarks, our supercomputer is on par with some of the top 50 supercomputers in the world in terms of petaflops of computing speed. Our growing AI capabilities are transforming the eBay experience for customers. For instance, our multi-phase magical listing initiative is helping us solve the longstanding trade-off between listing speed and quality. After fully rolling out generative AI descriptions, we are continuing to test and iterate on the next phase of our magical listing experience, which leverages user uploaded product images to help sellers fill in the category, title, and other item aspects for a listing. A subset of sellers are testing this experience in beta, and we are leveraging their feedback and expertise to train our models and expand coverage to a broader range of categories. Seller CSAT for this beta experience remains extremely positive, and we plan to expand the beta to more sellers during Q3. We are also leveraging generative AI to help sellers improve the quality of their product imagery. In Q2, we rolled out generative AI-powered background enhancements to 100% of iOS and Android users in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. This feature allows sellers to magically overlay their products on top of a variety of visually stunning backdrops. The customer response to this innovation has been outstanding. CSAT for this feature has reached 90%, and more than two-thirds of customers who have tried the feature have applied AI-generated backgrounds to their listings. Within seconds, sellers can easily stage their camping equipment against a beautiful [indiscernible] backdrop, showcase their used skis atop the snow-capped mountain, or display their pre-loved sandals on a beach at sunset. It's exciting to see the creativity of our selling community as they embrace generative AI tools to make their listings more compelling. Turning next to advertising. During Q2, the first-party advertising grew 12% while total ad revenue approached 2.2% penetration of GMV. Approximately 3.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q2, and we ended the quarter with roughly 1 billion live promoted listings out of our nearly 2.1 billion total listings. In early July, we launched a complete redesign of our eBay advertising platform, which fundamentally changed how sellers create and manage their ad campaigns and made it simpler than ever to activate our full range of advertising solutions. This new interface is now available to all sellers across our major markets. It includes a centralized dashboard enabling sellers to make data-driven decisions by leveraging near real-time performance metrics, including impressions, clicks and return on ad spend. For the first time, sellers can also see a list of personalized campaign recommendations aimed at helping them to achieve their sales goals, such as adding new keywords to increase listing visibility or lowering bids for keywords that are driving performance. Additionally, we've enhanced suggested campaigns to highlight new ad strategies for sellers by identifying emerging marketplace trends relevant to their inventory with prebuilt campaigns fully optimized by AI. As part of this redesign, we simplified our first-party advertising portfolio into three distinct solutions that more clearly align with the seller's campaign objectives. We unified our standard, advanced and express products into a single promoted listing solution, serving both fixed price and auction formats. When sellers launch a promoted listings campaign, they can pay on a cost per action basis for general placement, or select cost per click pricing for priority placement. In addition, promoted offsite ads enable sellers to tap into a wider audience through off-EVA channels such as Google. Promoted Offsite uses a dynamic CPC model and automated targeting so users can set up campaigns in just a few clicks after setting a daily budget. And our newest format, Promoted Stores, enables sellers to increase their brand visibility when buyers are browsing or searching for contextually relevant items. Ultimately, we believe the redesigned experience will help more sellers grow their businesses on eBay by broadening the appeal of our full suite of advertising solutions and delivering actionable insights in a more intuitive interface. Our payments platform continues to be a strategic growth driver for our marketplace more than 2 years after the completion of our migration. In recent years, we have added a breadth of popular and locally relevant payment options to offer even more choice and flexibility during the checkout experience. We were thrilled to launch Venmo as a payment option in the U.S. in Q2, enabling us to tap into its more than 90 million engaged users. Venmo's mobile-first checkout experiences and strong adoption among Gen Z and millennial audiences are particularly appealing as we continue to broaden our reach in younger demographics. The early results of this partnership are encouraging as a significant portion of our GMV from Venmo is coming from new or reactivated buyers. Our research has shown us that timely access to affordable financing is a key enabler for small businesses, which makes seller capital a pathway to unlocking more great inventory on eBay. In July, we expanded our seller capital offering with the launch of Business Cash Advance on eBay, a revenue-based financing solution provided by Liberis. This product connects eligible U.S. sellers with fast, flexible and transparent financing for up to $1 million in working capital in as little as 24 hours. Sellers can tap into flexible payment schedules that scale with their sales cycle and easily track their payback progress within the seller hub. In just a few weeks since launch, we've already funded over 1,000 sellers and dispersed millions of dollars of working capital. Now I'd like to share some highlights around eBay's impact as a company. Last quarter, we published our 2023 impact report showcasing how the company is creating economic opportunities and promoting a sustainable future. We remain on track toward our sustainability goals, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 59% compared to our 2019 baseline. We also published our 2024 eCommerce report, which analyzes the overall trends and sentiment around eCommerce at a global level. The report found that 86% of consumers surveyed have bought or sold pre-loved items, and 70% plan to purchase eCommerce items this year. Younger demographics are especially passionate about the circular economy, with more than 90% of millennial and Gen Z sellers saying they value eBay's ability to keep items out of landfills. And on the topic of eCommerce, one of the highlights of the second quarter was the Rocket Man Resale event, a partnership with Elton John, who released a personal collection of pre-loved fashion items exclusively on eBay. The event kicked off with a pop-up shop in the West Village of New York City, where Elton shared stories about items from his legendary closet during an eBay Live event. Fans around the world were able to pick up pieces of fashion history, ranging from Gucci jackets and Versace robes, to customized Prada loafers and vintage concert tees. All proceeds benefited the Elton John AIDS Foundation and its mission to be a powerful force in ending the AIDS epidemic. Our broader community also continues to support the causes most important to them. eBay for charity raised more than $47 million last quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Additionally, the eBay Foundation granted nearly $7 million in Q2 to strategic nonprofits, which are addressing and removing barriers to entrepreneurship for historically excluded groups. I'm proud to share that eBay was recently recognized by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. We were also acknowledged by Forbes as one of the best employers for new grads, recognizing companies who offer the best early career opportunities. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay and an important step toward our goal of sustainable long-term growth. Our GMV growth turned positive due to continued momentum in focus categories, investments in geospecific initiatives, and horizontal innovation driven by our growing capabilities in artificial intelligence. Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth at scale, and we believe our redesigned ads platform will make it simpler to adopt our full range of ad solutions, helping more sellers grow their businesses on eBay. We continue to advance our payments capabilities by introducing new services, expanding our breadth of trusted payment methods, and reducing transactional friction. And we delivered these results while layering disciplined investments for the future, generating double-digit earnings per share growth, and delivering compelling capital returns for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and context on the full year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic, FX-neutral basis, unless I note it otherwise. We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q2, driven by our execution against strategic initiatives, despite an uneven discretionary demand environment in our major markets. Gross merchandise volume returned to positive growth at 1% to $18.4 billion. Revenue grew 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 1 point to 27.9%. We delivered $1.18 of non-GAAP earnings per share at nearly 15% and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the second quarter. On an organic FX neutral basis, gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion. GMV would still have grown nearly 1% when adjusting for the roughly 50 basis points of impact from favorable use of timing in 2024. Our acquisition of Goldin contributed nearly 20 basis points to total FX neutral GMV growth in Q2 after the deal closed on May 16. In addition, foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 20 basis points to year-over-year GMV growth on a spot basis. Our teams continue to execute against our strategy, including focus category expansion, country-specific investments, and horizontal initiatives. The culmination of these efforts over recent quarters, combined with consumers looking for value, helped offset continued pressure on discretionary spending across our three largest markets. Focus category GMV grew over 4% in aggregate on nearly 5 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace driven by broad based momentum as P&A, collectibles, refurbished and luxury goods all contributed to growth. GMV for the rest of our marketplace was nearly flat in Q2, accelerating by more than 1 point from Q1, which reflects the continued progress of our horizontal innovation and geospecific product initiatives. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S GMV grew by nearly 1 point in Q2. Both organic traffic and conversion improved in the U.S., which helped us narrow our gap to U.S eCommerce market growth. Collectibles was a key contributor to U.S growth, including trading cards, where organic trends have improved in recent quarters, aided by our strategic investments and partnerships. International GMV grew by over 1% on an FX neutral basis, while FX was a 30 basis point headwind to spot growth. In the U.K., we noted some softness in C2C volumes to start the year, when the new U.K digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are working to mitigate this pressure by educating sellers on these reporting laws and through initiatives to improve the selling and buying experience in pre-owned apparel, which Jamie touched on earlier. In Germany, our focus category in horizontal investments helped offset prevailing macro headwinds. In addition, cross-border trade has been a key driver of international GMV growth in recent quarters. Greater China and Japan have powered this growth by providing great inventory for buyers across our major markets. In fact, our focus category coverage within CBT is even higher than our marketplace overall. In Japan, in particular, has seen its volume growth accelerate since we opened our authentication center there last year. Looking forward, we see more opportunities to onboard quality sellers in these regions and make it easier for them to bring attractive inventory to our marketplace. Moving on to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers and enthusiast buyers are once again stable sequentially at approximately 132 million and 16 million respectively at the end of Q2. On a year-over-year basis, total active buyer growth was fractionally positive for the first time since early 2021 as new and reactivated buyers remained positive and buyer retention continued to gradually improve. Spend per active buyer was stable, while spend per enthusiast buyer grew slightly year-over-year to just over $3,100. Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.57 billion during the second quarter, up 2% as revenue outpaced volume by roughly 1 point. Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. Our take rate in Q2 was approximately 14% at more than 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by first-party advertising. On a year over year basis, our take rate was roughly flat as tailwinds from first party ads, eBay international shipping and payments were offset by C2C initiatives and an FX headwind of approximately 10 basis points. Total advertising revenue grew 8% to $398 million in Q2 and represented nearly 2.2% penetration of GMV. First party ads grew over 12% to $384 million in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we faced lapping dynamics this quarter due to extraordinary growth in first party ads in Q2 of last year when we released CPC ads deferred revenue as a result of the rollout of Halo attribution. In addition, we continue to deprecate our legacy third-party display ads in Q2 with revenue declining roughly 49% to nearly $14 million. Shifting to profitability, non-GAAP gross margin declined roughly 30 basis points year-over-year in Q2 due to tax-related matters, including Canadian digital sales tax expenses recognized retroactively in 2022, traffic acquisition costs associated with a ramp in offsite [ph] ads, and foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds were partly offset by operational efficiencies, including lower cost of payments and lower depreciation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.9% in the quarter, improving 1 point year-over-year, as operational efficiencies, including our structured cost program, more than offset the higher cost of revenue of foreign exchange headwind of approximately 40 basis points and reinvestments in our full frontal marketing initiatives. As a result, non-GAAP operating income grew 5% year-over-year in Q2, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by nearly 15% to $1.18. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.45 in the quarter. Next I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $278 million, down year-over-year due to the timing of cash tax payments. Last year, the majority of our tax payments were delayed from Q2 to Q4 due to California's disaster tax relief program. We ended the second quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. As you will see in our 10-Q filing, on August 1, we will repay $750 million of principal for our senior fixed-rate notes coming June. We plan to issue up to $450 million of commercial paper to refinance a portion of those notes over the coming weeks. During Q2, we repurchased $1 billion of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $52 and had roughly $1.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $135 million in June, or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $7.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, nearly 150% of cumulative free cash flow over this period. Turning to our investment portfolio, our equity investments and warrants were valued at $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. The consortium led by Permira and Blackstone completed their acquisition of Adevinta on May the 29. We sold approximately 227 million shares and received roughly $2.4 billion in gross proceeds. We incurred over $450 million in cash taxes related to this transaction, which we plan to pay next year. Following the deal, we hold approximately 177 million shares, or 18% ownership of the outstanding equity, valued at roughly $1.9 billion as of the closing date. The consortium has the option, through November 29, to purchase from eBay roughly 10% ownership of the private entity for just over $1 billion. In addition, our investment portfolio includes Adyen warrants valued at nearly $340 million at the end of Q2. Our Adyen warrants value is calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of vesting. Our G market [ph] investment was valued at roughly $300 million at the end of the quarter. Moving to our outlook, we expect to generate GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion in the third quarter, representing FX neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Total organic FXN growth would be similar as we expect Goldin to contribute over 30 basis points to GMV growth in Q3. At current rates, foreign currency would represent a 10 basis point headwind to GMV growth. This outlook balances our strong execution year-to-date against an uncertain economic and regulatory environment. We forecast revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.56 billion in the third quarter, representing FX mutual growth of 1% to 3%. We estimate FX would represent more than half a point of headwind to spot revenue growth. We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.8% and 27.5%, representing year-over-year expansion between 40 and 110 basis points. This represents a sequential step down in operating margin due to normal seasonality, incremental organic investment, and a full quarter of M&A-related expenses, including integration costs. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.20 in Q3, representing year-over-year growth between 12% and 17%. Now shifting to our expectations for the remainder of the year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment, we expect FX neutral GMV growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year in Q4, driven by continued execution in focus categories, geospecific investments, and horizontal product delivery. At current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of more than 1 point to spot GMV growth year-over-year in Q4. We forecast Q4 revenue to grow modestly faster than GMV on an FX-neutral basis, implying a narrow growth delta versus Q3. Although we expect similar growth in first-party advertising during Q4, we anticipate modest pressure on core take rates from continued investments in C2C initiatives, mixed shifts towards higher ASP products, and seasonal category mix. In addition, we estimate FX will be a year-over-year benefit of roughly 30 basis points to spot revenue growth in the quarter due to hedging dynamics. We're maintaining our full year outlook for non-GAAP operating margin expansion of between 60 to 100 basis points. As we have noted throughout the year, where we land in this range is not solely tied to volume outcomes. Our strategic investments in 2024 have been crucial to our return to positive GMV growth. Given our execution to date, we are exploring opportunities for incremental investments to drive durable long-term growth. Additionally, we have absorbed one-time offsets to operating margin in 2024, notably about 20 basis points of headwind from M&A expenses, including integration costs. Our forecast for capital expenditure remains unchanged at between 4% to 5% of revenue for the full year, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We continue to expect free cash flow of just under $2 billion for the full year. Given our robust balance sheet position, we are raising our share repurchase target this year to at least $2.5 billion. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for the third quarter to be paid in September. Given our strong business performance to date, our outlook for the second half, and updated capital allocation plans, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to between 12% and 14% year-over-year for 2024. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay, despite the uneven macro backdrop. We achieved positive year-over-year GMV growth earlier than expected and maintained double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. In addition, we monetized a significant portion of our Adevinta stake at an attractive price and increased our full year stock repurchase target. It is a testament to our strong financial model that we are able to deliver healthy, balanced growth while continuing to invest in our business for the long run across focus categories, specific geographies and horizontal initiatives. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Nathan Feather with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nNathan Feather: Hey everyone, thanks for taking the question. A few quick questions on the advertising side of business. So first off, I'm interested to hear if you're seeing any green shoots in campaign adoption within the unified ad platform and also smart targeting. And then how should we think about advertising growth in the back half, not because it's a more difficult comp in 2Q? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, overall, we feel great about the momentum we're seeing in advertising. The new features that we just talked about, Nathan, just rolled out, so it's really early in the experience for those. We did test them in Australia before rolling them out to all the other major markets. When you ask about campaign adoption and other things, what's exciting about this new overhaul is, first it gives you a great performance snapshot of all of your campaigns in a redesigned interface. But secondarily, we now have daily recommendations for advertisers about things they can do, add keywords, manage their business, changing a campaign to make it better. And we have new types of suggested campaigns as part of this as well. Things like trend based suggestions. So you're seeing a -- we're seeing on the site, something popping whether it's around Christmas time or some other kind of event happening, tied to listings that a seller would have. And we're now doing trend based suggested campaigns all driven by AI. So we're excited about what we're seeing from the early results, but it's really kind of early stages in this. In general though, every time we've made it easier and simpler to adopt our ad products, it's resonated with sellers and helped drive the penetration up to what we're seeing today. Steve, maybe you just want to comment on our overall ad business.\nSteve Priest: Yes. Hi, Nathan. Despite some of the lapping, we do expect some modest take rate expansion in the second half driven by our 1P ads business, where again we see some modest acceleration as we go forward. Really continuing to drive momentum in the existing products, but also ramp up our promoted offsite products as well. So, pleased with the momentum we're seeing, and that should continue to drive momentum in the back half of the year.\nNathan Feather: Okay, great. Thanks. And then one more quick one. Now that you have for a supercomputer fully online, have made a lot of improvement from the seller side of things, interesting to think, over the next 12, 24 months, what are the key friction points do you think are really immediately addressable with the help of some of the Gen AI features? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, look, on the selling side, Nathan, the key is, I have this -- we have this vision of making it easier to list than to throw out. So, making it really seamless to onboard a new listing, any item in your closet, your garage, your home, et cetera for a C2C listing. And so, with the computing capability we have now with 2.1 billion listings, with 28 years of history of data, we're able to build these really sophisticated models that do a better job at predicting what an item is, filling in all the item attributes associated with it, creating the title, obviously writing the description since we do that, and to be able to do this at scale and very cost effectively. Because we're using a lot of tools that we've built on an internal LLMs or open source LLMs that we have, which makes us able to train on these massive data sets that we have and on this proprietary data. Similarly, things like enhanced background images, now live to 100% of customers, make items look better on the platform, make them stand out, and you can take it on your bed spreader, your desk, your rug, and then put it on this beautiful background and really helps kind of merchandise items from that perspective. Finally, I'd say we're launching new features on the buy side. I've talked about Shop the Look, which we continue to scale up, which gives the ability in the fashion category to see outfits together. And we're testing in the U.K market a feature called Explore, which based on your sizes, your style, things you care about, things that we know you've bought, will actually feed you information about interesting pre-loved products that are available on eBay. So we're excited by what we've seen to date, but I'm really excited that these new capabilities, the scale of what we have in terms of the infrastructure will help us to continue to accelerate and drive more innovation.\nNathan Feather: Great, I appreciate it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks, and good afternoon. Maybe first a follow-up to one of the previous questions, specifically kind of updating your thoughts around the growth of advertising longer term. Are you still thinking that that the attach rate or take rate can expand another couple of other basis points? Or could even be higher than that as you roll out more capabilities and as Gen AI tools are sort of incremental to what you were probably thinking about a few years ago. And then maybe, Steve, just a clarification on the capital allocation. I guess outside of the incremental buybacks, are you keeping dry powder for additional M&A? And if so, what are some of the areas of interest or focus? Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Colin, overall, we see a long runway for ads growth. That's both from adoption, from listings penetration, from ad rate optimization, and scaling some of the new products that we have, like promoted offsite and promoted source. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity. We are at 2.2% penetration. We said at Investor Day we see a line of sight to 3%, which we obviously are seeing nice progress to quarter after quarter. And when you look at the redesign that we just did, it's really about how do we make our advertising products more easier to access and easier for recommendations, et cetera, for existing sellers, but also easier for new sellers to bring in. So 3% is not a ceiling for us, it's just a line of sight that we put out there at Investor Day, and we continue to see a long runway of opportunity. Steve, do you want to take the second one?\nSteve Priest: Yes, of course. Colin, good to speak to you. As we always said, we focus on a balanced approach to capital allocation, and our first priority continues to be investing in the long-term growth of the business through the Build Buy Partner framework, and you've seen from the execution, you've seen from the momentum, you've seen from the growth that we saw in the second quarter that we're putting the money to good work. I think what's tremendous about our competitive advantage is the balance sheet that eBay has that affords us the ability not only to invest in the business, but to continue to give very healthy capital returns to shareholders. In fact, we've just increased our target for 2024 to at least $2.5 billion in share repurchases, in addition to the 8% increase in quarterly dividend that we've done for the last three quarters. And over the last couple of years, we've continued to demonstrate that continued commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, and there's no change in our philosophy in doing that. So I'm pleased with where we are, pleased with the balance, and I think, as I said, our balance sheet is a distinct advantage for us here at eBay.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on international, you called out the headwinds in U.K and some of the continuing, I guess, trends from Germany last quarter. What are you seeing broadly internationally and kind of what is the opportunity there? And then just to expand on the AI features so far, and understood there is a lot coming here and a lot of focus there, any way to quantify or think about what the impacts have been so far if you're seeing a tick up in GMV or any other way to quantify some of the successes you've seen there so far? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Hey, I'll pick up the first one. Steve here, good to speak to you. Just in terms of the international dynamics, just as a reminder, the GMV is reflected in the geography where the seller is domiciled. So specifically talking about the sort of international dynamics that we're seeing, undoubtedly, we continue to see a very uneven and dynamic environment, particularly in Europe, as discussion spend is pressured based on some of the discussions we've had over various quarters. With the investments we're making, particularly in C2C, around the German initiative and more recently in U.K pre-loved fashion, that's helping to offset some of those headwinds that we've seen. But the other element in terms of international, where we continue to see momentum, is in our cross border trade, particularly out of Greater China and Japan. We've seen a really healthy level of inventory. There's good focus category penetration coming out of those markets. We've continued to invest and so we talked about last quarter the authentication center that we have built and partnered with in Japan, which has continued to drive a great level of luxury inventory to our U.S and European customers. And so for the second quarter, we did see some sequential improvement in international GMV that grew over 1% on a year-over-year FXN basis, really is a reflection of the momentum and the investments that we're driving forward. Jamie, over to you on your second question.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, on AI, we are seeing really good engagement metrics from our customers that are using them. And when you look at like for example, the CSAT that we're seeing from them, it's 90% and above for some of our new products. And that correlates always with GMV. As we drive CSAT, we're able to drive GMV. We've made it easier to list C2C in some of our markets in Europe and Germany, and we're seeing that translate into CSAT, a 20% point increase in CSAT in the German market, for example. So we're pleased about what we're seeing. What's great about the AI developments is that they're learning algorithms, so they get smarter every single day, week and month that we learn with them, whether that's Explore, Shop the Look, or Magical Listings. And what we're seeing is increased engagement with them, and it's changing the experience for buying and sellers across so many vectors. It's changing it across search, across advertising, across the recommendations that we're providing on the site. It's giving us new tools like Explore. And so we'll continue to drive it. We continue to see really nice metrics come out of it, and those CSAT changes do lead to much healthier GMV growth.\nYgal Arounian: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. And please check your mute button. Okay. Hearing no response, we will move on to the next question. [Operator Instructions] We will take the next question from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for the question. Steve, by the end of this year, you guys will have put a lot of work into product and to expand the eBay platform and improve things and brought margins sort of below your typical range. When we think about the path forward, we'll appreciate that you still have many gross investments that you want to get behind. Your product and debt expense will be up pretty meaningfully relative to 2022. So as we look beyond this year, do you think that the investment cycle that we're sort of in has substantially laid the tracks to drive future growth from beyond 2024, 2025, and thus the need for incremental investment is thus much more subdued going forward?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Lee. Thank you for the question. I'm not going to get in my skis [ph] with regards to 2025, I'd just like to reflect on where we are for 2024. And we're exactly where we expect it to be. I think it's a testament to the company when we've continued to guide the 6,200 basis points of margin expansion this year. At the same time, continuing to invest in our business and support the focus category momentum, support the geospecific initiatives and the horizontal investments that Jamie has talked about. As we've been saying all year, we'll continue to invest where we see opportunities to drive long-term sustainable growth and we continue to lean in and we'll continue to do that in the second half. I think what I'd say is our financial architecture continues to provide us with that opportunity and I really am encouraged with the momentum that we're seeing as we have during 2024. And I think it's setting us up well, not only for the second half of this year, but for a longer term sustainable growth in the future.\nLee Horowitz: Great. And then maybe one follow up sort of on the second half [indiscernible] and all of the products that you guys are bringing to bear for the platform. You guys obviously have a lot of irons in the fire in terms of improving the platform, but is there any way to size sort of the incrementality in terms of GMV that you expect from some of these horizontal investments, some of these new focus categories that you expect to see in the second half? And if not a number, which amongst the broad array of products that you have do you think holds the most promise in terms of driving meaningful incremental dollars of GMV in the second half and beyond. Thanks so much.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Lee, when you think about the horizontal investments that we've been making, they've been really across the board. Think about the work that we're doing in search and recommendations and trust. We've done some geospecific investments in our C2C business in Germany as well. And so if you look at it for this quarter, we're nearly flat in our core categories, which is really nice growth quarter-on-quarter in our business over the past couple of quarters. So all of those combined are helping support not only our core categories, when I say core, I mean categories other than our focus categories, but they also help support our focus categories given that work. So I think about those as complimentary. When I look at our focus categories, they continue to work really well broadly across the board. Luxury was positive for the sixth straight quarter. We saw a really nice momentum in our parts and accessories business. Our collectibles business is trending well. We've normalized it more than twice the runway that we had coming into the pandemic. And we continue to innovate there. We were at the National, which is the big convention last week, talking about adding bulk magical listings for sellers in our trading card business, which got a great response. We introduced the partnership with PSA this quarter, allowing you to much more simply grade a card and then have it sold immediately right there afterwards without having to have it shipped back to you and ship there. So across the board, you see our focus categories growing at 4% even in this macro environment, which we feel good about. So we see the two of those working together. We see them complementary between the focus categories and the horizontal work. And the combination of those two is leading to the sequential improvement that we're seeing quarter-after-quarter.\nLee Horowitz: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nNikhil Devnani: Hi, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about active buyers. This metric has been flattish for a while now, but if eBay is to sustain low to mid-single-digit GMV growth as you look forward, then active buyers, at least enthusiast buyers, probably have to start growing again at some point. So how do you feel about your ability to improve this metric in the quarters to come? And is there anything investors can look at to get comfortable with your audience growth? Maybe some incremental color or detail you could provide on how these metrics might be trending within focus categories as a proxy for what's to come going forward. Thank you.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, we're exactly where I thought we would be and where we intended to be. Our active buyer count of 132 million was fractionally positive on a year-on-year basis for the first time since early 2021, and we've seen consistent improvements in our year-over-year trends over the last couple of years, and that's been driven by growth in new or reactivated buyers and an improvement in our retention year-on-year. So, I've been saying for a while, and I want to note, active buyers are not the core metric we're focused on, but we're pleased that the changes we've made to our buyer acquisition strategy are improving our ability to attract and retain active buyers, because that does help us drive what we really are driving, which is our enthusiast buyer strategy, which is those people that are shopping on the site that drive 70% of our GMV. And our enthusiast number has been consistent at 16 million for several quarters. They're buying more and remain healthy with an average annual spend of approximately $3,100 a year. And if you look at some of the stuff that I talked about in the script, whether it's the Met Gala work and fashion that we're doing or sponsoring Love Island or what we're doing in parts and accessories with McLaren, it's really about going out there, targeting and bringing enthusiast buyers onto the platform and then leveraging the cross-category shopping behavior we get from those buyers, which is really unique to eBay. So feel great about the traction of where we are, about the progress that we're making and the improvements in the underlying metrics that we're seeing.\nNikhil Devnani: If I could just ask a follow-up to that, would you say that the trends for the enthusiast buyers are a bit more pronounced, at least within the focus categories? Is that a fair statement?\nJamie Iannone: When you look at our enthusiast buyers, 90% of them shop in focus categories. So there's an overlap and a benefit from the focus category work that we're doing. But what we see is that when we acquire an enthusiast buyer in a focus category, it supports our core categories as well. So if a watch buyer comes in, they're going to buy $5,000 in watches on average, but then they're going to spend $5,000 in other categories that cross those focus categories and non-focus categories. Similarly, a handbag buyer will come in, if they purchase a $500 plus handbag, they'll spend $2,500 in handbags, but $5,000 in other categories. So part of why we focused on the enthusiast buyer is not just that 70% number, but it's because of the flywheel effect that it creates for the overall marketplace for focus categories and for our core categories.\nNikhil Devnani: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Hi guys. Good afternoon. Jamie, it seems like there are a lot of conflicting economic signals out there. I'm just curious, broad strokes, what you think of the consumer health both in the U.S. and Western Europe. Just curious, your core take. And then, Steve, maybe for you, can you just take one more cut at the 3Q GMV guide and the growth outlook at flat at the midpoint. Looking at the trend over the last six quarters, there's been clear progress, 1% FX neutral result in 2Q. Why would there be a step back in the third quarter? Thanks guys.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, Tom, look, as we've said over the past few quarters, we've seen some shifts in consumer spend driven by the macro environment as cost conscious consumers are increasingly searching for value. So we're a little bit more resilient from that standpoint. I announced last quarter that we've now hit 40% percent of our products are used or refurbished, and those goods have consistently outpaced the sales of brand-new goods since the pandemic. So as you can imagine, some categories are performing better than others in this macro environment. As I mentioned, our luxury category is still positive and has been for six straight quarters. So, I think there's more pressure on the less affluent customers in the consumer market. But our improved customer experience, combined with our real focus on non-new and season and providing great values in use, great values in refurbish, making C2C easier so that when macros challenge, consumers can come on and use the platform to sell products, is really helping us compete effectively in this macro environment. Steve, do you want to take the second one?\nSteve Priest: Yes, of course. Hey, Tom, how are you? Well, I've been pleased to see the momentum that we've been seeing quarter-after-quarter going forward. And obviously, the positive growth we saw in the second quarter, particularly in this macro environment. It has continued to be a reflection of the investments that we've been making over the last 18 months or so and the returns that we're seeing on the business. Obviously in the Easter we saw some benefits in the second quarter with a 50 basis point tailwind associated with Easter timing, but even having said that we were approaching about a point of positive GMV growth. The environment we're in continues to be very uneven and dynamic and we are sort of seeing some specific one-off impacts as we sort of think about this quarter with elevated year-over-year demand for summer travel, some one-off global sports events which are making their month-to-month trends a little bit uneven. And so as we contemplate the third quarter guide, we continue to take that uncertainty into effect. And the guide that we've put out there balances that perspective. But overall, I feel like we've had strong execution to date in this continued uncertain economic and regulatory environment. And I'm really remain encouraged with the momentum we're seeing. And we're confident we're on the path towards long-term sustainable growth.\nJamie Iannone: Operator, can we do one last question, please?\nOperator: Yes, and your final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAlex Hughes: Hey guys, this is Alex Hughes on for Ross. So looking at collectibles, news came out earlier this week that one of your trading card power sellers is moving to fanatics in the next few months. Can you just give a little more color as to that situation and if the Goldin deal played a factor? And then stepping back, collectibles is driving a lot of growth in focus categories, but can you just talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the opportunity more broadly? Thanks.\nJamie Iannone: Yes, I [technical difficulty] talk about any one seller, we have millions of sellers on the platform. What I say about collectors -- collectibles is that we feel really great about the innovation that we're driving in that business. Goldin coming on brings the world's most desirable inventory in collectibles onto the marketplace and new capabilities. The reception to Goldin last week at the National was really amazing to see people chanting. We had over 50 eBay Live events that we held there. And the consumer and the hobbyist is really resonating with the steps that we're taking, including bringing in Ken Goldin and his team into the business. They had a leading show with King of Collectibles Season 2, hitting great records on Netflix streaming. We supported the Goldin 100 auction, so all great there. We're also excited by the partnership with collectors and PSA. It really helps solve something that collectors have been asking for quite some time, which is simplify the process of grading and selling items. So now if you're selling -- sending an item to grade, usually that's going to massively increase the value and you're looking to potentially put that in a marketplace. We've really simplified that through this partnership with PSA and why we're seeing customers really adopt it is we're just making that whole process really friction free. So, we've been a leading secondary marketplace for over two decades. Every quarter we innovate and drive kind of new capabilities. The last one I would just talk about here is our work in eBay Live. In Q2, our eBay Live events grew 50% quarter-over-quarter. We started doing case breaks on eBay and our sellers are adopting them and finding it really great to see new capabilities we've built. We launched new features like Buy Spot directly on the Live Hub, which is a really kind of great feature for case breaks. And I participate in some of those, and they're just a lot of fun. And we launched eBay Live in the U.K in Q2 as well. So we're continuing to see good momentum on that component, which is really also help accelerating these new partnerships and all the work we've done with collections and price guides and new shipping methods over the past quarters and years to really accelerate our collectibles business and I'm encouraging by the stats of what we're seeing.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the third quarter and context on the full year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic, FX-neutral basis, unless I note it otherwise. We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q2, driven by our execution against strategic initiatives, despite an uneven discretionary demand environment in our major markets. Gross merchandise volume returned to positive growth at 1% to $18.4 billion. Revenue grew 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 1 point to 27.9%. We delivered $1.18 of non-GAAP earnings per share at nearly 15% and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the second quarter. On an organic FX neutral basis, gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion. GMV would still have grown nearly 1% when adjusting for the roughly 50 basis points of impact from favorable use of timing in 2024. Our acquisition of Goldin contributed nearly 20 basis points to total FX neutral GMV growth in Q2 after the deal closed on May 16. In addition, foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 20 basis points to year-over-year GMV growth on a spot basis. Our teams continue to execute against our strategy, including focus category expansion, country-specific investments, and horizontal initiatives. The culmination of these efforts over recent quarters, combined with consumers looking for value, helped offset continued pressure on discretionary spending across our three largest markets. Focus category GMV grew over 4% in aggregate on nearly 5 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace driven by broad based momentum as P&A, collectibles, refurbished and luxury goods all contributed to growth. GMV for the rest of our marketplace was nearly flat in Q2, accelerating by more than 1 point from Q1, which reflects the continued progress of our horizontal innovation and geospecific product initiatives. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S GMV grew by nearly 1 point in Q2. Both organic traffic and conversion improved in the U.S., which helped us narrow our gap to U.S eCommerce market growth. Collectibles was a key contributor to U.S growth, including trading cards, where organic trends have improved in recent quarters, aided by our strategic investments and partnerships. International GMV grew by over 1% on an FX neutral basis, while FX was a 30 basis point headwind to spot growth. In the U.K., we noted some softness in C2C volumes to start the year, when the new U.K digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are working to mitigate this pressure by educating sellers on these reporting laws and through initiatives to improve the selling and buying experience in pre-owned apparel, which Jamie touched on earlier. In Germany, our focus category in horizontal investments helped offset prevailing macro headwinds. In addition, cross-border trade has been a key driver of international GMV growth in recent quarters. Greater China and Japan have powered this growth by providing great inventory for buyers across our major markets. In fact, our focus category coverage within CBT is even higher than our marketplace overall. In Japan, in particular, has seen its volume growth accelerate since we opened our authentication center there last year. Looking forward, we see more opportunities to onboard quality sellers in these regions and make it easier for them to bring attractive inventory to our marketplace. Moving on to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers and enthusiast buyers are once again stable sequentially at approximately 132 million and 16 million respectively at the end of Q2. On a year-over-year basis, total active buyer growth was fractionally positive for the first time since early 2021 as new and reactivated buyers remained positive and buyer retention continued to gradually improve. Spend per active buyer was stable, while spend per enthusiast buyer grew slightly year-over-year to just over $3,100. Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.57 billion during the second quarter, up 2% as revenue outpaced volume by roughly 1 point. Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth. Our take rate in Q2 was approximately 14% at more than 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by first-party advertising. On a year over year basis, our take rate was roughly flat as tailwinds from first party ads, eBay international shipping and payments were offset by C2C initiatives and an FX headwind of approximately 10 basis points. Total advertising revenue grew 8% to $398 million in Q2 and represented nearly 2.2% penetration of GMV. First party ads grew over 12% to $384 million in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we faced lapping dynamics this quarter due to extraordinary growth in first party ads in Q2 of last year when we released CPC ads deferred revenue as a result of the rollout of Halo attribution. In addition, we continue to deprecate our legacy third-party display ads in Q2 with revenue declining roughly 49% to nearly $14 million. Shifting to profitability, non-GAAP gross margin declined roughly 30 basis points year-over-year in Q2 due to tax-related matters, including Canadian digital sales tax expenses recognized retroactively in 2022, traffic acquisition costs associated with a ramp in offsite [ph] ads, and foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds were partly offset by operational efficiencies, including lower cost of payments and lower depreciation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.9% in the quarter, improving 1 point year-over-year, as operational efficiencies, including our structured cost program, more than offset the higher cost of revenue of foreign exchange headwind of approximately 40 basis points and reinvestments in our full frontal marketing initiatives. As a result, non-GAAP operating income grew 5% year-over-year in Q2, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by nearly 15% to $1.18. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.45 in the quarter. Next I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $278 million, down year-over-year due to the timing of cash tax payments. Last year, the majority of our tax payments were delayed from Q2 to Q4 due to California's disaster tax relief program. We ended the second quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $6.3 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. As you will see in our 10-Q filing, on August 1, we will repay $750 million of principal for our senior fixed-rate notes coming June. We plan to issue up to $450 million of commercial paper to refinance a portion of those notes over the coming weeks. During Q2, we repurchased $1 billion of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $52 and had roughly $1.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $135 million in June, or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $7.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, nearly 150% of cumulative free cash flow over this period. Turning to our investment portfolio, our equity investments and warrants were valued at $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. The consortium led by Permira and Blackstone completed their acquisition of Adevinta on May the 29. We sold approximately 227 million shares and received roughly $2.4 billion in gross proceeds. We incurred over $450 million in cash taxes related to this transaction, which we plan to pay next year. Following the deal, we hold approximately 177 million shares, or 18% ownership of the outstanding equity, valued at roughly $1.9 billion as of the closing date. The consortium has the option, through November 29, to purchase from eBay roughly 10% ownership of the private entity for just over $1 billion. In addition, our investment portfolio includes Adyen warrants valued at nearly $340 million at the end of Q2. Our Adyen warrants value is calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of vesting. Our G market [ph] investment was valued at roughly $300 million at the end of the quarter. Moving to our outlook, we expect to generate GMV between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion in the third quarter, representing FX neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Total organic FXN growth would be similar as we expect Goldin to contribute over 30 basis points to GMV growth in Q3. At current rates, foreign currency would represent a 10 basis point headwind to GMV growth. This outlook balances our strong execution year-to-date against an uncertain economic and regulatory environment. We forecast revenue between $2.5 billion and $2.56 billion in the third quarter, representing FX mutual growth of 1% to 3%. We estimate FX would represent more than half a point of headwind to spot revenue growth. We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.8% and 27.5%, representing year-over-year expansion between 40 and 110 basis points. This represents a sequential step down in operating margin due to normal seasonality, incremental organic investment, and a full quarter of M&A-related expenses, including integration costs. We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.20 in Q3, representing year-over-year growth between 12% and 17%. Now shifting to our expectations for the remainder of the year. Assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment, we expect FX neutral GMV growth between flat and up 2% year-over-year in Q4, driven by continued execution in focus categories, geospecific investments, and horizontal product delivery. At current rates, FX would represent a tailwind of more than 1 point to spot GMV growth year-over-year in Q4. We forecast Q4 revenue to grow modestly faster than GMV on an FX-neutral basis, implying a narrow growth delta versus Q3. Although we expect similar growth in first-party advertising during Q4, we anticipate modest pressure on core take rates from continued investments in C2C initiatives, mixed shifts towards higher ASP products, and seasonal category mix. In addition, we estimate FX will be a year-over-year benefit of roughly 30 basis points to spot revenue growth in the quarter due to hedging dynamics. We're maintaining our full year outlook for non-GAAP operating margin expansion of between 60 to 100 basis points. As we have noted throughout the year, where we land in this range is not solely tied to volume outcomes. Our strategic investments in 2024 have been crucial to our return to positive GMV growth. Given our execution to date, we are exploring opportunities for incremental investments to drive durable long-term growth. Additionally, we have absorbed one-time offsets to operating margin in 2024, notably about 20 basis points of headwind from M&A expenses, including integration costs. Our forecast for capital expenditure remains unchanged at between 4% to 5% of revenue for the full year, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We continue to expect free cash flow of just under $2 billion for the full year. Given our robust balance sheet position, we are raising our share repurchase target this year to at least $2.5 billion. In addition, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for the third quarter to be paid in September. Given our strong business performance to date, our outlook for the second half, and updated capital allocation plans, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to between 12% and 14% year-over-year for 2024. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay, despite the uneven macro backdrop. We achieved positive year-over-year GMV growth earlier than expected and maintained double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. In addition, we monetized a significant portion of our Adevinta stake at an attractive price and increased our full year stock repurchase target. It is a testament to our strong financial model that we are able to deliver healthy, balanced growth while continuing to invest in our business for the long run across focus categories, specific geographies and horizontal initiatives. With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Yes. Hi, Nathan. Despite some of the lapping, we do expect some modest take rate expansion in the second half driven by our 1P ads business, where again we see some modest acceleration as we go forward. Really continuing to drive momentum in the existing products, but also ramp up our promoted offsite products as well. So, pleased with the momentum we're seeing, and that should continue to drive momentum in the back half of the year. Yes, of course. Colin, good to speak to you. As we always said, we focus on a balanced approach to capital allocation, and our first priority continues to be investing in the long-term growth of the business through the Build Buy Partner framework, and you've seen from the execution, you've seen from the momentum, you've seen from the growth that we saw in the second quarter that we're putting the money to good work. I think what's tremendous about our competitive advantage is the balance sheet that eBay has that affords us the ability not only to invest in the business, but to continue to give very healthy capital returns to shareholders. In fact, we've just increased our target for 2024 to at least $2.5 billion in share repurchases, in addition to the 8% increase in quarterly dividend that we've done for the last three quarters. And over the last couple of years, we've continued to demonstrate that continued commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, and there's no change in our philosophy in doing that. So I'm pleased with where we are, pleased with the balance, and I think, as I said, our balance sheet is a distinct advantage for us here at eBay. Hey, I'll pick up the first one. Steve here, good to speak to you. Just in terms of the international dynamics, just as a reminder, the GMV is reflected in the geography where the seller is domiciled. So specifically talking about the sort of international dynamics that we're seeing, undoubtedly, we continue to see a very uneven and dynamic environment, particularly in Europe, as discussion spend is pressured based on some of the discussions we've had over various quarters. With the investments we're making, particularly in C2C, around the German initiative and more recently in U.K pre-loved fashion, that's helping to offset some of those headwinds that we've seen. But the other element in terms of international, where we continue to see momentum, is in our cross border trade, particularly out of Greater China and Japan. We've seen a really healthy level of inventory. There's good focus category penetration coming out of those markets. We've continued to invest and so we talked about last quarter the authentication center that we have built and partnered with in Japan, which has continued to drive a great level of luxury inventory to our U.S and European customers. And so for the second quarter, we did see some sequential improvement in international GMV that grew over 1% on a year-over-year FXN basis, really is a reflection of the momentum and the investments that we're driving forward. Jamie, over to you on your second question. Hi, Lee. Thank you for the question. I'm not going to get in my skis [ph] with regards to 2025, I'd just like to reflect on where we are for 2024. And we're exactly where we expect it to be. I think it's a testament to the company when we've continued to guide the 6,200 basis points of margin expansion this year. At the same time, continuing to invest in our business and support the focus category momentum, support the geospecific initiatives and the horizontal investments that Jamie has talked about. As we've been saying all year, we'll continue to invest where we see opportunities to drive long-term sustainable growth and we continue to lean in and we'll continue to do that in the second half. I think what I'd say is our financial architecture continues to provide us with that opportunity and I really am encouraged with the momentum that we're seeing as we have during 2024. And I think it's setting us up well, not only for the second half of this year, but for a longer term sustainable growth in the future. Yes, of course. Hey, Tom, how are you? Well, I've been pleased to see the momentum that we've been seeing quarter-after-quarter going forward. And obviously, the positive growth we saw in the second quarter, particularly in this macro environment. It has continued to be a reflection of the investments that we've been making over the last 18 months or so and the returns that we're seeing on the business. Obviously in the Easter we saw some benefits in the second quarter with a 50 basis point tailwind associated with Easter timing, but even having said that we were approaching about a point of positive GMV growth. The environment we're in continues to be very uneven and dynamic and we are sort of seeing some specific one-off impacts as we sort of think about this quarter with elevated year-over-year demand for summer travel, some one-off global sports events which are making their month-to-month trends a little bit uneven. And so as we contemplate the third quarter guide, we continue to take that uncertainty into effect. And the guide that we've put out there balances that perspective. But overall, I feel like we've had strong execution to date in this continued uncertain economic and regulatory environment. And I'm really remain encouraged with the momentum we're seeing. And we're confident we're on the path towards long-term sustainable growth."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our strong Q2 results marked a notable step toward our goal of achieving sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. Our gross merchandise volume grew 1% to $18.4 billion in Q2. Revenue increased 2% to $2.57 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin rose by 1.0% to 27.9%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share rose by approximately 15% to $1.18. And we've turned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends during the quarter. I'm proud of our teams for delivering these results amid continued macroeconomic headwinds, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, and an evolving regulatory landscape. Now let's walk through some of the key drivers of our Q2 results. Focus category GMV grew by over 4% in Q2, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by approximately 5 points. After Motors Parts & Accessories, or P&A, which continued its trend of healthy growth, collectibles was the second largest contributor to GMV growth among focus categories in Q2. In mid-May, we closed a series of transactions with Collectors, parent company of PSA, and a leading provider of authentication and grading services for collectibles. Since then, we've made significant progress toward integrating Goldin, expanding our relationship with PSA, and elevating the eBay collectibles experience. We support the latest Goldin 100 auction, help drive awareness for the successful global premiere of King of Collectibles Season 2 on Netflix, and the Goldin team began hosting events on eBay Live. During Q2, we completed the transfer of trading card assets to the PSA vault ahead of schedule, and all PSA customers can now easily sell on eBay at the time of grading without having their cards shipped back to them. Since going live in late June, the PSA storefront has already sold tens of thousands of trading cards on eBay, and I'm excited for our companies to jointly drive innovation on behalf of hobbyists for years to come. eBay refurbished was also a significant contributor to GMV growth and was our fastest growing focus category year-over-year, as our combination of trust, value and quality continues to resonate with customers. Our selection of refurbished inventory continues to grow as we expand existing partnerships with OEMs like Dyson, onboard CVT sellers with access to unique items, and extend the program to new categories. During Q2, we expanded eBay refurbished to golf clubs, bringing warranties and hassle-free returns to thousands of previously owned golf clubs from the world's top brands. In June, we announced a sustainability collaboration with Seagate, a global leader in data storage solutions. We launched Seagate's official storefront on eBay for direct sales of factory-recertified hard drives. Not only are these refurbished products of great value for consumers, but this partnership can also eliminate a significant amount of e-waste by extending the product life cycles of quality hard drives. Consumers' desire to shop sustainably has also benefited our luxury focus categories, which delivered positive year-over-year GMV growth for the sixth straight quarter. As we acquire more sellers with well-priced luxury inventory, we've observed a strong correlation with incremental GMV. For instance, we saw a significant acceleration in cross-border demand after the opening of our Tokyo Authentication Center, which led to a meaningful expansion of our luxury handbag inventory. We reached a major milestone for our Authenticity Guarantee Program in Q2. We authenticated our 10th million item since the inception of the program in 2024. A pair of Air Jordan 1 Low Lucky Green sneakers, authenticated in our Las Vegas facility. During Q2, we also introduced optional authentication for luxury handbags priced between $200 and $500 in the U.S., which enables even more buyers and sellers to enjoy the benefits of our Authenticity Guaranteed Program. As our value proposition continues to grow, it's been exciting to see how partnerships have enabled eBay to show up in so many culturally relevant moments recently. These opportunities help us to evolve perceptions of eBay by showcasing our modernized experiences and connect with more enthusiasts shopping in pursuits of their passion. Just in the last quarter, La La Anthony, a Madeleine [ph] client showcased their pre-loved luxury accessories from eBay on the Met Gala red carpet. We saw eBay logos in the cockpits of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri as the McLaren Formula 1 team took the checkered flag at the Miami Grand Prix. We partnered with Disney to create a customized destination for May the 4th, enabling us to engage with Star Wars enthusiasts around the world as they explored the more than 1 million Star Wars-related collectible products on eBay. And in June, eBay returned as the headline sponsor for Love Island in the U.K., showcasing the power of pre-loved fashion to millions of households nationwide. Next, I'd like to update you on some of the geospecific investments we've been making. In March of 2023, we repurposed our strategic playbook for focus categories to better serve the needs of German consumers. This endeavor has reinvigorated our C2C business in Germany and helped us navigate challenging economic conditions in the region. In Q2, we sustained positive year-over-year growth in C2C volume in Germany as we lapped the full first quarter of this initiative. Healthier C2C trends have also supported our B2C business in the German market. The unique inventory listed by consumer sellers has led to a healthier customer acquisition funnel. When consumers begin selling, they also purchase twice as much on eBay as non-sellers, on average, with most of that incremental volume benefiting B2C sellers. The success of the German initiative influenced our decision to invest in an improved experience for pre-owned apparel in the U.K last quarter. These changes, including a new selling flow that makes it considerably easier to list on eBay, with image guidance, simpler item aspect collection, and a streamlined shipping module with a focused set of couriers and parameters. For buyers, we introduced optimized vertical browsing pages for fashion and new generative AI-powered buying experiences like Shop the Look and Explore. Although we're only a few months in, we're seeing positive leading indicators in the strategically important category. For users of the new selling flow, we have observed a 20 point increase in CSAT, a material reduction in average listing time, and an increase in listings and sold items per seller. A growing number of buyers have engaged with our new AI-powered fashion shopping features and are eagerly awaiting the enhanced personalization and filtering we plan to bring to shop the look and explore in the coming months. These shopping experiences are emblematic of the overall acceleration in the pace of innovation at eBay. Our investments in generative AI and machine learning are simplifying the selling and buying experiences, making our marketplace more efficient and helping us better serve customers at all phases of their shopping journey. To power these experiences, our core AI team is training and fine-tuning large language models using eBay's proprietary data to build even more magical innovations for customers. In Q2, we entered the high-performance computing realm by deploying our first supercomputer, which gave us the capacity to build and fine-tune even larger LLMs on trillions of tokens. Based on publicly available performance benchmarks, our supercomputer is on par with some of the top 50 supercomputers in the world in terms of petaflops of computing speed. Our growing AI capabilities are transforming the eBay experience for customers. For instance, our multi-phase magical listing initiative is helping us solve the longstanding trade-off between listing speed and quality. After fully rolling out generative AI descriptions, we are continuing to test and iterate on the next phase of our magical listing experience, which leverages user uploaded product images to help sellers fill in the category, title, and other item aspects for a listing. A subset of sellers are testing this experience in beta, and we are leveraging their feedback and expertise to train our models and expand coverage to a broader range of categories. Seller CSAT for this beta experience remains extremely positive, and we plan to expand the beta to more sellers during Q3. We are also leveraging generative AI to help sellers improve the quality of their product imagery. In Q2, we rolled out generative AI-powered background enhancements to 100% of iOS and Android users in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. This feature allows sellers to magically overlay their products on top of a variety of visually stunning backdrops. The customer response to this innovation has been outstanding. CSAT for this feature has reached 90%, and more than two-thirds of customers who have tried the feature have applied AI-generated backgrounds to their listings. Within seconds, sellers can easily stage their camping equipment against a beautiful [indiscernible] backdrop, showcase their used skis atop the snow-capped mountain, or display their pre-loved sandals on a beach at sunset. It's exciting to see the creativity of our selling community as they embrace generative AI tools to make their listings more compelling. Turning next to advertising. During Q2, the first-party advertising grew 12% while total ad revenue approached 2.2% penetration of GMV. Approximately 3.1 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q2, and we ended the quarter with roughly 1 billion live promoted listings out of our nearly 2.1 billion total listings. In early July, we launched a complete redesign of our eBay advertising platform, which fundamentally changed how sellers create and manage their ad campaigns and made it simpler than ever to activate our full range of advertising solutions. This new interface is now available to all sellers across our major markets. It includes a centralized dashboard enabling sellers to make data-driven decisions by leveraging near real-time performance metrics, including impressions, clicks and return on ad spend. For the first time, sellers can also see a list of personalized campaign recommendations aimed at helping them to achieve their sales goals, such as adding new keywords to increase listing visibility or lowering bids for keywords that are driving performance. Additionally, we've enhanced suggested campaigns to highlight new ad strategies for sellers by identifying emerging marketplace trends relevant to their inventory with prebuilt campaigns fully optimized by AI. As part of this redesign, we simplified our first-party advertising portfolio into three distinct solutions that more clearly align with the seller's campaign objectives. We unified our standard, advanced and express products into a single promoted listing solution, serving both fixed price and auction formats. When sellers launch a promoted listings campaign, they can pay on a cost per action basis for general placement, or select cost per click pricing for priority placement. In addition, promoted offsite ads enable sellers to tap into a wider audience through off-EVA channels such as Google. Promoted Offsite uses a dynamic CPC model and automated targeting so users can set up campaigns in just a few clicks after setting a daily budget. And our newest format, Promoted Stores, enables sellers to increase their brand visibility when buyers are browsing or searching for contextually relevant items. Ultimately, we believe the redesigned experience will help more sellers grow their businesses on eBay by broadening the appeal of our full suite of advertising solutions and delivering actionable insights in a more intuitive interface. Our payments platform continues to be a strategic growth driver for our marketplace more than 2 years after the completion of our migration. In recent years, we have added a breadth of popular and locally relevant payment options to offer even more choice and flexibility during the checkout experience. We were thrilled to launch Venmo as a payment option in the U.S. in Q2, enabling us to tap into its more than 90 million engaged users. Venmo's mobile-first checkout experiences and strong adoption among Gen Z and millennial audiences are particularly appealing as we continue to broaden our reach in younger demographics. The early results of this partnership are encouraging as a significant portion of our GMV from Venmo is coming from new or reactivated buyers. Our research has shown us that timely access to affordable financing is a key enabler for small businesses, which makes seller capital a pathway to unlocking more great inventory on eBay. In July, we expanded our seller capital offering with the launch of Business Cash Advance on eBay, a revenue-based financing solution provided by Liberis. This product connects eligible U.S. sellers with fast, flexible and transparent financing for up to $1 million in working capital in as little as 24 hours. Sellers can tap into flexible payment schedules that scale with their sales cycle and easily track their payback progress within the seller hub. In just a few weeks since launch, we've already funded over 1,000 sellers and dispersed millions of dollars of working capital. Now I'd like to share some highlights around eBay's impact as a company. Last quarter, we published our 2023 impact report showcasing how the company is creating economic opportunities and promoting a sustainable future. We remain on track toward our sustainability goals, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 59% compared to our 2019 baseline. We also published our 2024 eCommerce report, which analyzes the overall trends and sentiment around eCommerce at a global level. The report found that 86% of consumers surveyed have bought or sold pre-loved items, and 70% plan to purchase eCommerce items this year. Younger demographics are especially passionate about the circular economy, with more than 90% of millennial and Gen Z sellers saying they value eBay's ability to keep items out of landfills. And on the topic of eCommerce, one of the highlights of the second quarter was the Rocket Man Resale event, a partnership with Elton John, who released a personal collection of pre-loved fashion items exclusively on eBay. The event kicked off with a pop-up shop in the West Village of New York City, where Elton shared stories about items from his legendary closet during an eBay Live event. Fans around the world were able to pick up pieces of fashion history, ranging from Gucci jackets and Versace robes, to customized Prada loafers and vintage concert tees. All proceeds benefited the Elton John AIDS Foundation and its mission to be a powerful force in ending the AIDS epidemic. Our broader community also continues to support the causes most important to them. eBay for charity raised more than $47 million last quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Additionally, the eBay Foundation granted nearly $7 million in Q2 to strategic nonprofits, which are addressing and removing barriers to entrepreneurship for historically excluded groups. I'm proud to share that eBay was recently recognized by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. We were also acknowledged by Forbes as one of the best employers for new grads, recognizing companies who offer the best early career opportunities. In closing, Q2 was another strong quarter for eBay and an important step toward our goal of sustainable long-term growth. Our GMV growth turned positive due to continued momentum in focus categories, investments in geospecific initiatives, and horizontal innovation driven by our growing capabilities in artificial intelligence. Our advertising business continues to deliver robust growth at scale, and we believe our redesigned ads platform will make it simpler to adopt our full range of ad solutions, helping more sellers grow their businesses on eBay. We continue to advance our payments capabilities by introducing new services, expanding our breadth of trusted payment methods, and reducing transactional friction. And we delivered these results while layering disciplined investments for the future, generating double-digit earnings per share growth, and delivering compelling capital returns for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes, overall, we feel great about the momentum we're seeing in advertising. The new features that we just talked about, Nathan, just rolled out, so it's really early in the experience for those. We did test them in Australia before rolling them out to all the other major markets. When you ask about campaign adoption and other things, what's exciting about this new overhaul is, first it gives you a great performance snapshot of all of your campaigns in a redesigned interface. But secondarily, we now have daily recommendations for advertisers about things they can do, add keywords, manage their business, changing a campaign to make it better. And we have new types of suggested campaigns as part of this as well. Things like trend based suggestions. So you're seeing a -- we're seeing on the site, something popping whether it's around Christmas time or some other kind of event happening, tied to listings that a seller would have. And we're now doing trend based suggested campaigns all driven by AI. So we're excited about what we're seeing from the early results, but it's really kind of early stages in this. In general though, every time we've made it easier and simpler to adopt our ad products, it's resonated with sellers and helped drive the penetration up to what we're seeing today. Steve, maybe you just want to comment on our overall ad business. Yes, look, on the selling side, Nathan, the key is, I have this -- we have this vision of making it easier to list than to throw out. So, making it really seamless to onboard a new listing, any item in your closet, your garage, your home, et cetera for a C2C listing. And so, with the computing capability we have now with 2.1 billion listings, with 28 years of history of data, we're able to build these really sophisticated models that do a better job at predicting what an item is, filling in all the item attributes associated with it, creating the title, obviously writing the description since we do that, and to be able to do this at scale and very cost effectively. Because we're using a lot of tools that we've built on an internal LLMs or open source LLMs that we have, which makes us able to train on these massive data sets that we have and on this proprietary data. Similarly, things like enhanced background images, now live to 100% of customers, make items look better on the platform, make them stand out, and you can take it on your bed spreader, your desk, your rug, and then put it on this beautiful background and really helps kind of merchandise items from that perspective. Finally, I'd say we're launching new features on the buy side. I've talked about Shop the Look, which we continue to scale up, which gives the ability in the fashion category to see outfits together. And we're testing in the U.K market a feature called Explore, which based on your sizes, your style, things you care about, things that we know you've bought, will actually feed you information about interesting pre-loved products that are available on eBay. So we're excited by what we've seen to date, but I'm really excited that these new capabilities, the scale of what we have in terms of the infrastructure will help us to continue to accelerate and drive more innovation. Yes, Colin, overall, we see a long runway for ads growth. That's both from adoption, from listings penetration, from ad rate optimization, and scaling some of the new products that we have, like promoted offsite and promoted source. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity. We are at 2.2% penetration. We said at Investor Day we see a line of sight to 3%, which we obviously are seeing nice progress to quarter after quarter. And when you look at the redesign that we just did, it's really about how do we make our advertising products more easier to access and easier for recommendations, et cetera, for existing sellers, but also easier for new sellers to bring in. So 3% is not a ceiling for us, it's just a line of sight that we put out there at Investor Day, and we continue to see a long runway of opportunity. Steve, do you want to take the second one? Yes, on AI, we are seeing really good engagement metrics from our customers that are using them. And when you look at like for example, the CSAT that we're seeing from them, it's 90% and above for some of our new products. And that correlates always with GMV. As we drive CSAT, we're able to drive GMV. We've made it easier to list C2C in some of our markets in Europe and Germany, and we're seeing that translate into CSAT, a 20% point increase in CSAT in the German market, for example. So we're pleased about what we're seeing. What's great about the AI developments is that they're learning algorithms, so they get smarter every single day, week and month that we learn with them, whether that's Explore, Shop the Look, or Magical Listings. And what we're seeing is increased engagement with them, and it's changing the experience for buying and sellers across so many vectors. It's changing it across search, across advertising, across the recommendations that we're providing on the site. It's giving us new tools like Explore. And so we'll continue to drive it. We continue to see really nice metrics come out of it, and those CSAT changes do lead to much healthier GMV growth. Yes, Lee, when you think about the horizontal investments that we've been making, they've been really across the board. Think about the work that we're doing in search and recommendations and trust. We've done some geospecific investments in our C2C business in Germany as well. And so if you look at it for this quarter, we're nearly flat in our core categories, which is really nice growth quarter-on-quarter in our business over the past couple of quarters. So all of those combined are helping support not only our core categories, when I say core, I mean categories other than our focus categories, but they also help support our focus categories given that work. So I think about those as complimentary. When I look at our focus categories, they continue to work really well broadly across the board. Luxury was positive for the sixth straight quarter. We saw a really nice momentum in our parts and accessories business. Our collectibles business is trending well. We've normalized it more than twice the runway that we had coming into the pandemic. And we continue to innovate there. We were at the National, which is the big convention last week, talking about adding bulk magical listings for sellers in our trading card business, which got a great response. We introduced the partnership with PSA this quarter, allowing you to much more simply grade a card and then have it sold immediately right there afterwards without having to have it shipped back to you and ship there. So across the board, you see our focus categories growing at 4% even in this macro environment, which we feel good about. So we see the two of those working together. We see them complementary between the focus categories and the horizontal work. And the combination of those two is leading to the sequential improvement that we're seeing quarter-after-quarter. Yes, we're exactly where I thought we would be and where we intended to be. Our active buyer count of 132 million was fractionally positive on a year-on-year basis for the first time since early 2021, and we've seen consistent improvements in our year-over-year trends over the last couple of years, and that's been driven by growth in new or reactivated buyers and an improvement in our retention year-on-year. So, I've been saying for a while, and I want to note, active buyers are not the core metric we're focused on, but we're pleased that the changes we've made to our buyer acquisition strategy are improving our ability to attract and retain active buyers, because that does help us drive what we really are driving, which is our enthusiast buyer strategy, which is those people that are shopping on the site that drive 70% of our GMV. And our enthusiast number has been consistent at 16 million for several quarters. They're buying more and remain healthy with an average annual spend of approximately $3,100 a year. And if you look at some of the stuff that I talked about in the script, whether it's the Met Gala work and fashion that we're doing or sponsoring Love Island or what we're doing in parts and accessories with McLaren, it's really about going out there, targeting and bringing enthusiast buyers onto the platform and then leveraging the cross-category shopping behavior we get from those buyers, which is really unique to eBay. So feel great about the traction of where we are, about the progress that we're making and the improvements in the underlying metrics that we're seeing. When you look at our enthusiast buyers, 90% of them shop in focus categories. So there's an overlap and a benefit from the focus category work that we're doing. But what we see is that when we acquire an enthusiast buyer in a focus category, it supports our core categories as well. So if a watch buyer comes in, they're going to buy $5,000 in watches on average, but then they're going to spend $5,000 in other categories that cross those focus categories and non-focus categories. Similarly, a handbag buyer will come in, if they purchase a $500 plus handbag, they'll spend $2,500 in handbags, but $5,000 in other categories. So part of why we focused on the enthusiast buyer is not just that 70% number, but it's because of the flywheel effect that it creates for the overall marketplace for focus categories and for our core categories. Yes, Tom, look, as we've said over the past few quarters, we've seen some shifts in consumer spend driven by the macro environment as cost conscious consumers are increasingly searching for value. So we're a little bit more resilient from that standpoint. I announced last quarter that we've now hit 40% percent of our products are used or refurbished, and those goods have consistently outpaced the sales of brand-new goods since the pandemic. So as you can imagine, some categories are performing better than others in this macro environment. As I mentioned, our luxury category is still positive and has been for six straight quarters. So, I think there's more pressure on the less affluent customers in the consumer market. But our improved customer experience, combined with our real focus on non-new and season and providing great values in use, great values in refurbish, making C2C easier so that when macros challenge, consumers can come on and use the platform to sell products, is really helping us compete effectively in this macro environment. Steve, do you want to take the second one? Operator, can we do one last question, please? Yes, I [technical difficulty] talk about any one seller, we have millions of sellers on the platform. What I say about collectors -- collectibles is that we feel really great about the innovation that we're driving in that business. Goldin coming on brings the world's most desirable inventory in collectibles onto the marketplace and new capabilities. The reception to Goldin last week at the National was really amazing to see people chanting. We had over 50 eBay Live events that we held there. And the consumer and the hobbyist is really resonating with the steps that we're taking, including bringing in Ken Goldin and his team into the business. They had a leading show with King of Collectibles Season 2, hitting great records on Netflix streaming. We supported the Goldin 100 auction, so all great there. We're also excited by the partnership with collectors and PSA. It really helps solve something that collectors have been asking for quite some time, which is simplify the process of grading and selling items. So now if you're selling -- sending an item to grade, usually that's going to massively increase the value and you're looking to potentially put that in a marketplace. We've really simplified that through this partnership with PSA and why we're seeing customers really adopt it is we're just making that whole process really friction free. So, we've been a leading secondary marketplace for over two decades. Every quarter we innovate and drive kind of new capabilities. The last one I would just talk about here is our work in eBay Live. In Q2, our eBay Live events grew 50% quarter-over-quarter. We started doing case breaks on eBay and our sellers are adopting them and finding it really great to see new capabilities we've built. We launched new features like Buy Spot directly on the Live Hub, which is a really kind of great feature for case breaks. And I participate in some of those, and they're just a lot of fun. And we launched eBay Live in the U.K in Q2 as well. So we're continuing to see good momentum on that component, which is really also help accelerating these new partnerships and all the work we've done with collections and price guides and new shipping methods over the past quarters and years to really accelerate our collectibles business and I'm encouraging by the stats of what we're seeing."

We do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jamie. \nJamie Iannone: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered strong results in Q1, even as we continue to navigate ongoing challenges in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion, while revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%, non-GAAP earnings per share rose 13% to $1.25, and we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering these results as they remain relentlessly focused on reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. And I am pleased that we remain on track for GMV growth to turn positive by Q3 or Q4 of this year.\n Now let's walk through some of the key drivers of our quarterly results. Focus categories play an important part in delivering relevant experiences to customers on eBay and remained a significant driver of underlying growth on our marketplace during Q1. Overall, focus category GMV grew nearly 5% last quarter, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 6 points. Motors parts and accessories, or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth among focus categories despite facing headwinds in January due to extreme weather patterns in the U.S. Our teams continue to innovate on the P&A shopping experience, growing awareness, enhancing trust and expanding the great inventory our marketplace has to offer.\n Fitment is a central component of trust within the P&A category, helping customers understand exactly which of our more than 600 million live listings in this category fit their vehicle. We continue to work closely with large P&A sellers to augment their inventory using the MyFitment tool kit. To date, we have enhanced eligible auto parts with approximately 5 billion pieces of incremental fitment data, and we've continued to see a double-digit increase in conversion on these augmented listings.\n Additionally, last quarter, we redesigned our self-service experience to simplify how sellers onboard, view and publish fitment data for P&A listings. Our updated experience better serves small- and medium-sized businesses, which make up our largest cohort of P&A sellers.\n On the buyer side, we continue to improve our value proposition for mass-market P&A shoppers looking to maintain their vehicles. During Q1, we added a Motors DIY guide page that makes do-it-yourself projects more accessible by integrating expert content for common maintenance jobs alongside eBay listings for the specific parts, tools and materials needed to complete them. Our full-funnel approach to marketing has increased awareness and consideration of eBay as a trusted place to shop for auto parts and accessories. And I'm excited that yesterday, we announced a multiyear partnership with the McLaren Racing Formula 1 team, which means motor sports enthusiasts around the world will see eBay branding on McLaren team race cars starting with the Miami Grand Prix this week.\n EBay has been a leading player in collectibles for over 2 decades. And in recent years, we've accelerated the pace of innovation in areas like trading cards, which is one of our focus categories. We've rolled out new features like [ My Collections ], price guides, authentication and grading partnerships, revamped condition standards, live commerce, vault storage and new shipping methods to reduce costs.\n In Q1, we continued to innovate by launching a simplified listing flow for sports trading cards to all U.S. sellers. This experience leverages our proprietary technology to [ prefill ] the listing with relevant item aspects, provide simpler shipping options and offer smarter pricing recommendations based on the value and the condition of the card. This rollout has resulted in a double-digit percentage reduction in listing time and measurable increases in completed listings and sold items per customer. We are also seeing a more than 20% increase in CSAT for U.S. sports trading card sellers versus our baseline prior to this rollout.\n In recent quarters, we've seen improving volume trends in trading cards as many of the new and returning hobbyists who joined eBay during the pandemic remain highly engaged with our platform. With so much enthusiasm in the hobby, it's the perfect time to talk about the definitive agreement we announced a few weeks ago with Collectors, parent company of PSA, which is the gold standard in third-party authentication and grading of trading cards and collectibles.\n EBay and Collectors have entered into 3 separate transactions designed to streamline and improve the overall experience for hobbyists. As part of this deal, I'm incredibly excited to welcome Ken Goldin to eBay. We have agreed to acquire Goldin, a leading U.S.-based auction house for high-value collectibles, which brings together 2 renowned marketplace brands in the trading card hobby. Many of you know Ken from his fantastic series on Netflix, King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch. Combining Goldin with eBay enhances our respective marketplace offerings by expanding the range of inventory available to eBay customers and opening up an expansive global audience for Goldin sellers. We believe this will enable a more well-rounded collecting experience across price points and service models, complementing our acquisition of TCGplayer and recent partnership with sports trading card company COMC.\n Additionally, eBay has entered into commercial agreements with Collectors and PSA to reduce friction in the authentication and grading of trading cards. We also agreed to divest the eBay vault to PSA. Through a newly branded service offering, our companies plan to launch an integrated program to buy, sell, grade and store trading cards. EBay will become PSA's exclusive marketplace partner for trading cards, enabling hobbyists to more easily list and sell their cars on eBay at the time of grading.\n Importantly, these deals enable each company to prioritize what it does best. At eBay, we can focus on enhancing our marketplace and streamlining the buying and selling experience for millions of hobbyists, while collectors can concentrate on its operational expertise in grading, authenticating and securely storing collectibles. There'll be more we can share about our company's joint plans after the deals close, which we expect to occur during Q2, subject to closing conditions.\n In Q1, we also continued to rapidly innovate on our eBay Live experience, which now spans multiple categories, including collectibles. We expanded coverage to new categories like comics and sports memorabilia. We introduced a revamped auctions experience that makes bidding more seamless and reliable. We enabled viewing on desktop so that buyers can join live events wherever they are shopping. And we dramatically improved the event discoverability on the home page with personalized recommendations. While eBay Live remains in beta, we are extremely excited about continuing to scale this experience throughout the year.\n As a pioneer of recommerce, giving pre-owned goods a second life is core to who we are as a company. We reached a major milestone in Q1 as pre-owned and refurbished goods reached 40% of total GMV on our marketplace after consistently outpacing the sales of brand-new goods since the pandemic. In service of that mission, a major priority in 2024 is strengthening our consumer value proposition in pre-owned fashion. Through our multiyear partnership with Love Island in the U.K., we have grown awareness of the sustainability benefits of recommerce and educated consumers on the potential economic savings from shopping for pre-owned items. But there is more we can do to unlock consumers' closets and accelerate the circular economy.\n To that end, last month, we began to dramatically streamline the buying and selling experiences for pre-owned fashion on eBay, focusing on the U.K. We redesigned our shopping experience from the ground up to reduce friction and better meet the needs of modern fashion consumers. Our initial rollout included a number of features and improvements such as a simplified selling flow, curated item specifics, photo guidance, intelligent pricing suggestions and condensed shipping options.\n We also eliminated final value fees on pre-owned apparel for C2C sellers in the U.K. and introduced new AI-powered tools to enhance discovery and drive more inspirational shopping behavior on our marketplace. One such feature is explore a new AI-powered shopping feed, enabling users to browse a nearly unlimited list of personalized recommendations based on implicit and explicit interest signals, such as the users' style preferences and sizes. The explore feed updates in real time in response to products that users interact with, while buyers can refine their shopping journey using our visually similar search feature powered by computer vision. Explore is focused on fashion to start, and we plan to expand its capabilities later this year. Explore is currently live for all U.K. users in beta alongside small pilots in other countries as we gather feedback and insights.\n In April, we also rolled out an early version of shop the look, which leverages generative AI to create shoppable content and fashion recommendations. Shop the look showcases a variety of styles such as business casual, Scandinavian minimalism or urban athleisure. Recommended outlets are linked to visually similar products on eBay, drawing from our hundreds of millions of live listings in fashion. Shop the look is live in iOS in the U.S. and U.K., and we will evolve this experience throughout 2024 based on customer feedback, including additional styles, greater diversity of outfits and increased user control over personalization.\n Next, I'd like to go deeper on the transformative power of AI. Last quarter, I talked about the meaningful strides we've taken in establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. In Q1, we doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of 2023, which enabled our teams to accelerate our training and fine-tuning of foundational large language models to power a number of eBay features and services. In addition to powering consumer-facing features like explore, shop the look, magical listing and background enhancement, we're increasingly leveraging generative AI to change how we work, driving meaningful productivity and efficiency improvements across our organization.\n A prime example of this is within our Global Customer Experience organization, or GCX. We are in the midst of a multiyear journey to transform our GCX capabilities using technology. Our north star for customer service is not just to reduce cost, but meaningfully improve the quality of interactions. Recently, we implemented generative AI technology that supports our GCX teammates by analyzing incoming communications to create a simple summary of customers' needs and intent. This technology automatically extracts relevant solutions and next steps from an LLM fine-tuned using our comprehensive knowledge base and policy documents. We are now able to present solutions and a clear and concise structure to our GCX team, allowing them to quickly provide customers with the help and support they need, improving the accuracy, consistency and quality of support. With tens of millions of live customer contacts annually, these efficiencies should yield meaningful cost savings for our GCX organization.\n Generative AI tools are also improving our developer productivity and accelerating our overall tech velocity. Last year, we made GitHub Copilot available to all of our developers and saw encouraging results. We observed measurable improvements in productivity, along with code acceptance and accuracy. Nearly 3/4 of our developers now use Copilot every day. In parallel, we began building internal tools to streamline our development processes and improve efficiency. We fine-tuned an open-source LLM with eBay's codebase and other internal data to develop a proprietary coding assistant that has been incredibly helpful in labor-intensive areas like code migration and software upkeep. For instance, we estimate these tools can reduce the time required for code migration by as much as 20%.\n We also created an internal GPT specifically for developers that answers thousands of questions per week, serving as a knowledge base for our internal documentation. Overall, we're still early in our generative AI productivity journey, but these are just a few examples of proprietary tools we've introduced to our GCX and technology teams that are already yielding tangible benefits.\n Turning to advertising. Our ads business continued to deliver healthy growth at scale while improving velocity and price realization for our sellers at compelling return on ad spend levels. During Q1, first-party advertising grew 28%, while total ad revenue represented 2.1% of GMV. During the quarter, over 3 million sellers adopted a single ad product, and we ended the quarter with over 950 million live Promoted Listings.\n Our standard cost per acquisition units remain the largest contributor to year-over-year ad revenue growth in Q1, followed by our cost per click advanced product. We are also seeing promising results from some Promoted Listing products in beta. One such product that's continued to gain traction in beta is Offsite Ads. This off-eBay solution enables sellers to more actively participate in extending the reach of their listings through CPC ads placed on external services. This product leverages eBay's decades of advertising technology investment on behalf of those sellers, enabling advanced targeting, campaign management and pricing optimization. We expanded our go-to-market efforts for Offsite Ads towards the end of last year, and this product emerged as a material contributor to first-party ad revenue growth in Q1. We have ambitious road map to further optimize these ad units and increase seller adoption throughout 2024.\n Now let's turn to impact. The eBay community continues to impress us with their generosity. Last quarter, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise more than $46 million, up 18% year-over-year. We also recently published our eighth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. With our purpose of connecting people and building communities to create economic opportunity for all, we know diversity makes us a better and stronger place to work, sell and buy.\n Among the highlights from our 2023 DE&I report was the launch of our first-ever inclusion index, which helps us gain a stronger understanding of our employee experience, measure our progress over time and determine how we can better support our employees as a workplace.\n Our Communities of Inclusion, our internal eBay resource groups, also remained an integral part of what we do. In 2023, our 11 COIs hosted more than 360 global events, reaching more than 17,000 attendees during the year. And finally, for the eighth year in a row, we've concluded our gender pay equity study, and I'm proud to report our gender pay ratio remained consistent at just over 100% globally.\n In closing, Q1 marked a strong start to 2024 as we exceeded our financial targets and continued to make progress toward our goal of long-term sustainable GMV growth. Focus categories maintained significant momentum despite ongoing macro pressure on discretionary e-commerce. After many quarters of consistent innovation in focus categories like luxury, P&A, refurbished, sneakers and streetwear, we are bringing our innovation playbook to pre-owned fashion in the U.K. to simplify selling, drive inspirational shopping and promote the circular economy.\n Our agreement with Collectors would further strengthen our value proposition for hobbyists as we streamline the process of buying, selling, grading and storing trading cards. And we believe our advancements in generative AI are fundamentally changing the customer experience on eBay, increasing productivity across our organization and ultimately driving more value for shareholders. Our momentum and excelling pace of innovation are a testament to the incredible work of our employees, who continue to execute our strategic road map and service of our customers.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. \nStephen Priest: Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter in context on the full year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, unless I note otherwise.\n We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q1 despite an uneven demand environment in our major markets to start the year. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%. We delivered $1.25 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 13%. And we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\n Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was roughly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 1 point to reported GMV growth. Our teams did a tremendous job executing on our strategy across focus categories, country-specific investments and horizontal initiatives. Our Q1 volume also benefited from an extra day in the quarter due to the leap year. However, we continue to navigate through a tough environment to discretionary e-commerce, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, 2 of our largest markets.\n Focus categories GMV grew by nearly 5% in aggregate or roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. This continued momentum was driven by positive volume growth in P&A, refurbished, collectibles and luxury goods, reflecting the breadth and resilience of our focus categories.\n Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q1. As Jamie mentioned, P&A was the largest contributor to growth among focus categories despite the slow start in January caused by severe weather conditions in the U.S. These headwinds slightly offset the solid performance in trading cards where we've seen improving volume trends in recent quarters, which disproportionately benefit our U.S. business.\n International GMV grew nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis and increased by nearly 3% as reported due to FX tailwinds. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of our Germany C2C initiative and overall growth in the region. I am pleased that Germany C2C volume growth remain positive even as we began to lap the rollout of these changes in March of last year.\n In the U.K., we did see some softness in C2C volumes during the quarter when the new U.K. digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are currently working to educate sellers that many of them actually do not incur taxes for selling pre-owned items. In contrast, our B2C business trends were consistent with recent quarters as we kept pace with our closest market benchmark as reported by the British Retail Consortium.\n Moving on to buyers. Trading 12-month active buyers and enthusiast buyers were both stable sequentially at approximately $132 million and $16 million, respectively, at the end of Q1. Within the quarter, growth in new and reactivated buyers remained positive year-over-year, while buyer retention improved compared to recent quarters. Despite macro headwinds, spend per active and enthusiast buyer both grew slightly compared to a year ago.\n Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.56 billion during Q1, up over 2%, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 60 basis points to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in the first quarter was over 13.7%, down less than 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by FX headwinds, which more than offset the seasonal improvement in core take rate in Q1. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate expanded by nearly 10 basis points driven by tailwinds from first-party advertising, eBay International Shipping and payments, offset by a 20 basis point headwind from FX.\n Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $384 million and represented 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 28% to $370 million, nearly 28 points faster than volume. Our legacy third-party display ads remained a headwind to total advertising growth in Q1, with revenue declining 55% to less than $15 million. As discussed in recent quarters, we continue to selectively [ duplicate ] these noncore ads on certain pages to improve the overall user experience, and they now make up less than 4% of total ad revenue.\n Shifting to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 60 basis points year-over-year as headwinds from eBay International Shipping, traffic acquisition costs associated with the ramp of Offsite Ads and FX were more than offset by lower depreciation expenses and cost of payments efficiencies. As we discussed last quarter, our depreciation expense in 2024 is impacted by an extension in the accounting useful life of our servers and networking equipment, which primarily will be recognized in cost of revenue. Additional information will be available in our 10-Q filing.\n Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3% in Q1, improving 70 basis points year-over-year and 360 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our operating margins benefited from our workforce reduction in January, the aforementioned accounting change, cost of payment efficiencies and our structural cost program. This leverage was partly offset by a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 70 basis points and reinvestments into sales and marketing to support our full-funnel initiatives.\n We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by nearly 13% to $1.25 in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $0.85 in Q1. The difference was primarily due to stock-based compensation and a reduction in the value of our equity investment portfolio, largely due to FX movements.\n Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was $472 million in Q1, down year-over-year due to the timing of working capital items. We ended the first quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $4.9 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $499 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q1 and had $2.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $139 million in March or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $6.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% of cumulative free cash flow over that period.\n Now I'll give an update on our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1. Our Adevinta stake was valued at over $4 billion, down over $200 million quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to FX movements.\n On April 24, the consortium led by Permira and Blackstone received its final regulatory clearance regarding the offer to acquire Adevinta. We expect this transaction to close on May 29, subject to closing conditions. While changes in FX rates impact the value of our stake for quarterly reporting purposes, they do not impact the cash proceeds we expect from the pending deal.\n Our Adyen warrants were valued at over $500 million at the end of Q1. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of vesting.\n Turning to our outlook. Our strategy and execution are driving underlying growth in our business. However, the macro environment remains challenging and dynamic. Balancing these factors, we forecast Q2 GMV between $17.8 million and $18.2 billion, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 2% and flat year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point of headwind to Q2 GMV growth year-over-year and roughly 1 point of headwind quarter-over-quarter.\n We expect to generate revenue between $2.49 billion and $2.54 billion in Q2, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Our forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by close to 1 point on an FX-neutral basis. We estimate FX will represent more than a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth in Q2. We expect first-party ad revenue growth to decelerate to low double digits year-over-year in Q2 due to lapping and onetime factors.\n As we discussed last year, a deferral release to CPC ads put forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue into Q2 of 2023. In addition, benefits from our Halo attribution change in Q2 of last year led to extraordinary growth in first-party advertising overall, which will create more challenging year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of this year. However, we do expect a recovery in advertising growth during the second half of 2024 driven by continued adoption and optimization of our first-party ad products.\n We forecast Q2 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.9% and 27.6% or 35 basis points of year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. This is consistent with historical seasonality, where Q1 is usually the high point for operating margin, followed by a sequential decline in Q2, reflecting both the seasonal decrease in volumes and the ramp-up in product and full-funnel marketing investments.\n We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.10 and $1.15 in the second quarter, representing non-GAAP EPS growth between 6% and 11% year-over-year. Based on current rates, FX would represent a headwind of roughly 2.5 percentage points.\n Moving to the full year. We continue to plan our business assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment this year. Within this context, we expect our FX-neutral GMV to turn positive in Q3 or Q4. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by approximately 2 points for the full year on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, FX represents close to a 1 point expected headwind to total spot revenue growth.\n We maintain our outlook for non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year. Where we land in this range could vary based on investment opportunities we see throughout the year, not necessarily our volume trends alone. At current rates, we continue to expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of roughly 50 basis points to operating margins, which is mostly offset by an expected tailwind of 40 basis points primarily driven by the change in accounting estimate associated with the extension of the useful life of servers and networking equipment.\n For the full year, we project capital expenditures to be between 4% and 5% of revenue, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 with the majority generated in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our free cash flow has been temporarily pressured in recent years by scheduled repatriation payments and changes to the tax treatment of R&D expenses, which will largely alleviate after 2025. From a timing perspective, our federal cash tax payments will revert to a normal schedule this year with our largest outlay occurring in Q2, leading to a more normalized cadence of free cash flow.\n From a capital allocation standpoint, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for Q2 to be paid in June. For the full year, we are targeting share repurchases of just over $2 billion. Given our better-than-expected Q1 results and our confidence in our strategy and execution, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to 9% to 11% year-over-year in 2024.\n In closing, Q1 was a strong quarter for eBay as we exceeded our outlook across our key financial metrics. Our results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid persistent challenges in the global economy. We remain on track to achieve positive GMV growth this year in Q3 or Q4, driven by our accelerating pace of innovation across focus categories and horizontal initiatives. In addition, we are laser-focused on further improving our cost discipline and efficiency and expect operating margin expansion this year, even as we make incremental investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth. As a result, we plan to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year at the midpoint of our guidance and exceed our original 3-year target for total capital returns.\n With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nathan Feather from Morgan Stanley. \nNathaniel Feather: So I want to dig in and touch on the margins. The 2Q non-GAAP operating margin is at about 300 basis points at the midpoint. On top of this normal marketing seasonality you see, can you provide some more color on the puts and takes which are driving that? And then with that in mind, how should we think about the cadence of operating margin through the remainder of the year? \nStephen Priest: Nathan, I'll take that. Steve here. Our Q2 guide implies margin expansion between 0 and 70 basis points year-over-year, depending on where we land in the range. That's really driven by underlying advertising growth efficiency gains, partly offset by some of the investments we've talked about and some FX headwinds that we're seeing. You're right, there's a bit of seasonality that we deal with as we go through the year. The second quarter does generally have sequential contraction. That's in line with the last few years because seasonally, Q1 is our strongest quarter for operating margin due to relatively higher GMV and low expenses.\n A few of the puts and takes that we're seeing, the first thing I would say is that we continue to lean in, in investment. We see a lot of opportunity for good ROI as we are continuing to be committed to growing GMV in either third or the fourth quarter of next year, and we're seeing benefits associated with that. Secondly, there's a couple of dynamics with regards to advertising. In Q2 of 2023, we saw changes in terms of the Halo attribution, which really sort of saw significant momentum in our first-party ads in the second quarter of 2023. And in addition, we saw some revenue recognition changes in the second quarter, about $9 million that was pulled forward.\n So we're sort of dealing with those 2 dynamics. But as you've seen from our prepared remarks, we continue to be confident in the outlook, and we continue to guide margin expansion through 2024 between 60 and 100 basis points as we look forward to going through the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. \nColin Sebastian: Jamie, I appreciate the review of all the product initiatives in the marketplace. And I guess in the context of the confidence you have in that acceleration in growth in the back half, I guess, which of these innovations are driving the most incremental activity or conversions on the platform? And is that part of that acceleration that you're anticipating? \nJamie Iannone: Yes. I'd really say it's threefold, Colin. I'd say first is the focus category work that we're doing. You see us not only kind of expanding what we're doing there, but investing in categories that we've already launched before like what we announced in collectibles with the Collectors and Goldin this quarter, what we're seeing in terms of the growth of luxury, of P&A, refurbished at 5%. So that's probably the first thing I'd say.\n The second is just the geo work that we're doing in specific geographies. If you look at the work that we did in Germany on C2C, we continue to see healthy returns from that. We're more than a year from launching that. We launched that in Q1 of last year, and we're continuing to see positive C2C momentum in Germany and healthy metrics and encouraging numbers from our CSAT standpoint. So that's the second.\n And the third I would say is the efforts that we have against our horizontal innovations. So we've talked about things like magical listing, of simplifying the selling flow. We continue to invest in search, in CRM and a number of horizontal initiatives. I'd call out 2 that we talked about this quarter, which are explore and shop the look, new AI capabilities that we're launching first in fashion to really create a new browsing experience. So all 3 of those together is what gives us the confidence in moving forward and how we feel good about what we put out there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. \nEric Sheridan: Maybe 2-parter, if I could. In terms of cross-border commerce, what's the current state you're seeing in terms of cross-border and region-wide globally in terms of a driver of GMV dynamics into the business? And have you seen any impact from increased competition from cross-border, especially in areas of the world like Europe? And how would you characterize the state of competitive intensity? \nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, our cross-border is one of our great strengths as a business. 1 in 5 transactions or about 20% of GMV goes across borders on eBay, and it's very strategic for us in that for sellers, it opens up a very vast demand opportunity. We've talked for a couple of quarters about eBay International Shipping as an example of one of those things. We've talked about our payments team investing in buyer and seller FX to make that more easy and take the friction out for customers.\n So you take, for example, a look at parts and accessories, which continues to perform well at mid-single digits, one of the largest contributors to that growth is really healthy CBT business. You look at luxury being positive even in this macro environment. And it's in part because of the work we're doing where we launched an authentication center in Japan, and we have great inventory coming out of there.\n So it's one of the benefits that we have from a global marketplace. We think we're unique from that perspective in terms of what we offer, in terms of the capability for sellers, and we're pleased with what we're seeing in the growth of CBT overall. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. \nThomas Champion: Jamie, I'm wondering if you could just talk about your view of the health of the consumer. There doesn't seem to be much consensus out there. And just curious, your view and how that may have changed over the last 90 days. \nJamie Iannone: Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. Look, we continue to operate in a really dynamic environment given the macro challenges globally with inflationary pressures and interest rates. We talked about Q1 started off a bit softer because of some of the weather, but then we had a reasonably good tax period. I would say the backdrop remains weaker in Europe than it does in the U.S., where U.S. is in better shape. If you look at e-commerce growth rates in U.K. and Germany this quarter, they're negative, and that's overall, and obviously, we play more in discretionary than consumables.\n So I think this is where our model is really winning, right? Our model is working because we have global demand. We've really focused in on non-new-in-season over the last couple of years. And we can provide value in a marketplace like this. We can be a great avenue for selling in terms of consumer demand. And I think it's why we reached the milestone this year or this quarter of now 40% of our inventory is pre-loved or refurbished is because we're seeing strength from the value proposition that we've built, and it's resonating with the consumer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. \nBryan Smilek: It's Bryan Smilek on for Doug. Could you just talk about the velocity of investments across generative AI and any affiliated CapEx needs and then, I guess, on that same line of questioning too, just timing of when you could see revenue uplift from these investments over time? \nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, we're really excited by the advancements that we're making in AI. I feel somewhat of a privilege to be able to lead this company because when you think of the breadth of categories, the data that we have for over 20 years, the scale of the size of business, being able to put AI against those is really compelling. So on the consumer-facing side, we continue to see amazing traction with magical listing. It's now -- writes description for 100% of users across native, desktop, mWeb, and we're working on Phase 2 there. We've got that rolled out to a percentage of sellers, which is great.\n When you look at explore and shop the look, those are 2 features that, starting with fashion, are really bringing a whole new browse experience to eBay. If you think about it, our fashion category on eBay is over $10 billion, and we have amazing inventory and incredible values. But if you wanted to put an outfit together on eBay, the buyer had to do all that work for the last 20 years. And most of them did, and we built a really healthy business. Now we can use AI to basically do all of that hard work for the consumer. And depending on their style, which they tell us or we infer based on their sizing, we can put the right products in front of them directly.\n So we're really excited by the potential of what we're seeing, by the acceptance that we have. When you look at magical listing, 90% of customers that use and accept what we put together, which is fantastic, and also just the interest from our consumers. Steve, maybe you want to talk a little bit about financially? \nStephen Priest: Yes, of course. So Bryan, I think there's a couple of things I'd say. First of all, our size, our scale and our financial architecture with eBay with the strength of the balance sheet we have is a distinct advantage for us, particularly as we look to exploit generative AI and the benefits that come from that. With regards to how we're thinking about it from a CapEx and an OpEx standpoint, all of the investment that we've talked about in 2024 from a CapEx standpoint is embedded in the 4% to 5% of revenue, which we've guided for the full year.\n In terms of the OpEx investments associated with generative AI and everything that comes from that, that is contemplated in both our earnings and margin architecture that we've laid out. And in terms of revenue contribution, that's sort of embedded in the work that we've done and is enabling us to put the margin accretion up on the board between 60 and 100 basis points for 2024. And it will also give us benefits, as Jamie has talked about, for years to come as we improve trust and momentum on the overall platform. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge from TD Cowen. \nJohn Blackledge: On the trading card business, you guys mentioned that trading card volume is up over the last few quarters. Just curious, what's driving the uptick in volume? And would you expect volumes to kind of remain elevated as we get through the year? \nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, we're excited by what we're seeing in trading cards. What we saw is that there was obviously a lot of activity during the pandemic, and we were able to hold on to a lot of customers that we acquired and frankly, a lot of customers that got reactivated or reinterested into the hobby. When you look at collectibles, we've been investing in it over quite some time. We've launched a number of features, whether it's price guides, making it easier, [ My Collections ] on the marketplace, we've launched new shipping forms, we've introduced authentication in that product, et cetera, and really built the suite of what collectors were asking us to do.\n And then this quarter, as you saw a few weeks ago, the 3-part agreement that we've developed with Collectors really takes that to the next level. And frankly, this is something that collectors have been asking us to do, which is, hey, we create real value in getting our cards graded. We love selling them on eBay. How could we make that whole process easier? And when you look at the 3 separate deals that we put together, that's exactly what we intended to do with trading cards.\n So we're bringing in the Goldin platform, excited to bring Ken and his team in. This is going to bring really unique inventory, frankly, the world's most desirable inventory into the platform. Like they sold a Honus Wagner card for $7 million. It was the third most expensive trading card ever sold. Michael Jordan sneakers that sold for $1.4 million. There's this great book of the [ Goldin 100 ]. And we're just excited to have this new high-touch, white-glove experience available to sellers and to bring a global reach now for Goldin sellers on the marketplace.\n And then when you look at the commercial agreements, making it easier to buy, sell, trade and grade on the platform through an integrated experience is a great opportunity because clearly, a lot of collectors buy ungraded cards on eBay that they want to get graded or they've just graded a card or they realize the value based on the grade they have that they want to sell it. And so our ability to do this really helps grow the industry. It helps grow the hobby, and it's really what collectors have been asking us to do. So I'm really excited about what it means for the collecting and the future here at eBay. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer from Arete Research. \nRichard Kramer: A quick question for both of you. Jamie, when you talk about the guidance of take rate expansion, can you talk through how you might mitigate risk of seeing seller defections to other platforms that are doing cheap promotions and also whether you'd anticipate the promotion like you're doing now in the U.K. on used apparel being something that's permanent and that people can get used to? And then, Steve, could you maybe quickly just size the cost savings from the headcount reductions you made at the start of the year and whether that's going to get reinvested? Or is that something that's supporting the margin expansion you mentioned? \nJamie Iannone: Yes. Look, the reason that we have such good seller metrics and sellers are so loyal, Richard, is because we let them build a brand on eBay. They build an eBay store, they have a presence, and we bring them a lot of really unique value propositions. We bring them the scale and breadth of global buyers on the marketplace. We bring them all of the capabilities to market and advertise their products really easily. We just -- we've been working the last couple of quarters on this product I talked about with Offsite Ads, which helps them bring traffic back. And so it's really -- those are really, I think, important to sellers. And what we see is really good feedback from doing those.\n And what we're doing in the U.K., U.K. is a unique market for us. We have very strong awareness and we're a leading player in recommerce. But we view the pre-loved fashion category as really a gateway to recommerce. Pre-owned apparel shoppers are really valuable to our business. And what we see is that 30% of our C2C sellers actually sell in pre-owned apparel. So given the strategic nature, we not only looked at what we could do to drive that velocity with the fee structure that we outlined, but we built about 10 different discrete features in that launch, from a streamlined listing flow where there's much simpler shipping options, for example, we simplified item aspects to just the relevant fields, we now offer photo guidance in a really compelling way, including better image removal and background swap, changed the default. So did a lot of things to make the selling process easier while launching explore and shop the look on the buying side to really take advantage of a much more modern experience for shopping for fashion on eBay. \nStephen Priest: Thanks, Jamie. Obviously, we made a difficult decision at the start of the year to go through the reduction in force. From the magnitude of the headcount and the restructuring charges, it's obviously a significant event for us. It was not just about sort of driving cost savings and creating capacity. It was also about sort of driving greater agility, speed in decision-making across the organization, so we can continue to deliver for our customers.\n As it pertains to the value of that, that, along with other savings that we continue to drive through operational efficiencies, through our structural cost program that we've been running through for a few years, it is creating the capacity for us to invest back into the business to stimulate sort of customer stickiness and also to drive long-term sustainable growth. It is contemplated in the 60 to 100 basis points of margin expansion that we've laid out for the full year and obviously, a critical part of the earnings momentum that we're expecting to see with double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint of our guide. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morton from MoffettNathanson. \nMichael Morton: Just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about what we discussed last quarter as well, and it's the impressive strength you've seen from cross-border, I think with your ability to lower the friction around it and then also places like China opening back up. I'd love to learn a little bit more about the composition of the goods coming cross-border, if it's very representative of the entire focus category platform or eBay more broadly and then the ability to see continued strength from some of the reasons -- regions like China. \nJamie Iannone: Yes. So look, it's been an important strategic area for us. One of the reasons we launched eBay International Shipping was the whole concept that we wanted you to be able to ship a product from LA to Norway, and it would be as easy as shipping it from LA to Chicago. And we built that product, and eBay takes care of all of the hard work and the background of customs, duties, et cetera. And we're seeing really great feedback in terms of the CSAT and the performance that we're getting from our sellers from that perspective. We built a lot of features like buyer and seller FX, so that the buyer can transact in their currency of choice to make that really easy for the -- for both the buyer and for the seller.\n When you look at the categories and what we have, it's really across the board. And it's really aligned with our focus category strategy that we have. So whether that's parts and accessories and being able to generate great parts and accessories in different parts of the world and ship them around the world, even to unique parts that may be manufactured in one country that there may be global demand from that perspective.\n We talked about handbags being another example in luxury where there's inventory coming out of, for example, Japan. It's a great market for handbags. By putting authentication center there, that now opens up global demand for the great inventory that sits there. And really, when you think about it, there's great inventory in a lot of our categories all across the world. And what we really focus on is how to open that up.\n When you think about the scale of a $73 billion platform where 1 in 5 transactions is going across borders, the scale of that means that it's broad, it's very diverse from that perspective. And we have 2 billion live listings on the platform. So really just about every category on the platform benefits from the work we've done in cross-border and making that simpler and easier for our customers. \nOperator: We have no further questions. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephen Priest",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with the financial highlights section of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the second quarter in context on the full year before we begin Q&A. My comments will reflect FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons, unless I note otherwise.\n We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics in Q1 despite an uneven demand environment in our major markets to start the year. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion. Revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%. We delivered $1.25 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 13%. And we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\n Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume of $18.6 billion was roughly flat year-over-year, while foreign exchange was a tailwind of nearly 1 point to reported GMV growth. Our teams did a tremendous job executing on our strategy across focus categories, country-specific investments and horizontal initiatives. Our Q1 volume also benefited from an extra day in the quarter due to the leap year. However, we continue to navigate through a tough environment to discretionary e-commerce, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, 2 of our largest markets.\n Focus categories GMV grew by nearly 5% in aggregate or roughly 6 points faster than the remainder of our marketplace during the quarter. This continued momentum was driven by positive volume growth in P&A, refurbished, collectibles and luxury goods, reflecting the breadth and resilience of our focus categories.\n Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was nearly flat in Q1. As Jamie mentioned, P&A was the largest contributor to growth among focus categories despite the slow start in January caused by severe weather conditions in the U.S. These headwinds slightly offset the solid performance in trading cards where we've seen improving volume trends in recent quarters, which disproportionately benefit our U.S. business.\n International GMV grew nearly 1% on an FX-neutral basis and increased by nearly 3% as reported due to FX tailwinds. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of our Germany C2C initiative and overall growth in the region. I am pleased that Germany C2C volume growth remain positive even as we began to lap the rollout of these changes in March of last year.\n In the U.K., we did see some softness in C2C volumes during the quarter when the new U.K. digital sales reporting requirements came into effect. We are currently working to educate sellers that many of them actually do not incur taxes for selling pre-owned items. In contrast, our B2C business trends were consistent with recent quarters as we kept pace with our closest market benchmark as reported by the British Retail Consortium.\n Moving on to buyers. Trading 12-month active buyers and enthusiast buyers were both stable sequentially at approximately $132 million and $16 million, respectively, at the end of Q1. Within the quarter, growth in new and reactivated buyers remained positive year-over-year, while buyer retention improved compared to recent quarters. Despite macro headwinds, spend per active and enthusiast buyer both grew slightly compared to a year ago.\n Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.56 billion during Q1, up over 2%, outpacing volume by over 2 points. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly 60 basis points to reported year-over-year revenue growth. Our take rate in the first quarter was over 13.7%, down less than 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by FX headwinds, which more than offset the seasonal improvement in core take rate in Q1. On a year-over-year basis, our take rate expanded by nearly 10 basis points driven by tailwinds from first-party advertising, eBay International Shipping and payments, offset by a 20 basis point headwind from FX.\n Total advertising revenue grew 20% to $384 million and represented 2.1% penetration of GMV. First-party ads grew 28% to $370 million, nearly 28 points faster than volume. Our legacy third-party display ads remained a headwind to total advertising growth in Q1, with revenue declining 55% to less than $15 million. As discussed in recent quarters, we continue to selectively [ duplicate ] these noncore ads on certain pages to improve the overall user experience, and they now make up less than 4% of total ad revenue.\n Shifting to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 60 basis points year-over-year as headwinds from eBay International Shipping, traffic acquisition costs associated with the ramp of Offsite Ads and FX were more than offset by lower depreciation expenses and cost of payments efficiencies. As we discussed last quarter, our depreciation expense in 2024 is impacted by an extension in the accounting useful life of our servers and networking equipment, which primarily will be recognized in cost of revenue. Additional information will be available in our 10-Q filing.\n Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3% in Q1, improving 70 basis points year-over-year and 360 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our operating margins benefited from our workforce reduction in January, the aforementioned accounting change, cost of payment efficiencies and our structural cost program. This leverage was partly offset by a foreign exchange headwind of roughly 70 basis points and reinvestments into sales and marketing to support our full-funnel initiatives.\n We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by nearly 13% to $1.25 in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share was $0.85 in Q1. The difference was primarily due to stock-based compensation and a reduction in the value of our equity investment portfolio, largely due to FX movements.\n Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our free cash flow was $472 million in Q1, down year-over-year due to the timing of working capital items. We ended the first quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $4.9 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased $499 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $51 during Q1 and had $2.9 billion remaining under our buyback authorization at the end of the period. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $139 million in March or $0.27 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned $6.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 134% of cumulative free cash flow over that period.\n Now I'll give an update on our investment portfolio. Our equity investments and warrants were valued at over $5 billion at the end of Q1. Our Adevinta stake was valued at over $4 billion, down over $200 million quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to FX movements.\n On April 24, the consortium led by Permira and Blackstone received its final regulatory clearance regarding the offer to acquire Adevinta. We expect this transaction to close on May 29, subject to closing conditions. While changes in FX rates impact the value of our stake for quarterly reporting purposes, they do not impact the cash proceeds we expect from the pending deal.\n Our Adyen warrants were valued at over $500 million at the end of Q1. Our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including Adyen share price and the probability of vesting.\n Turning to our outlook. Our strategy and execution are driving underlying growth in our business. However, the macro environment remains challenging and dynamic. Balancing these factors, we forecast Q2 GMV between $17.8 million and $18.2 billion, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 2% and flat year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent roughly 0.5 point of headwind to Q2 GMV growth year-over-year and roughly 1 point of headwind quarter-over-quarter.\n We expect to generate revenue between $2.49 billion and $2.54 billion in Q2, representing FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 1% year-over-year. Our forecast implies revenue will outpace volume by close to 1 point on an FX-neutral basis. We estimate FX will represent more than a 1 point headwind to spot revenue growth in Q2. We expect first-party ad revenue growth to decelerate to low double digits year-over-year in Q2 due to lapping and onetime factors.\n As we discussed last year, a deferral release to CPC ads put forward approximately $9 million of ad revenue into Q2 of 2023. In addition, benefits from our Halo attribution change in Q2 of last year led to extraordinary growth in first-party advertising overall, which will create more challenging year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of this year. However, we do expect a recovery in advertising growth during the second half of 2024 driven by continued adoption and optimization of our first-party ad products.\n We forecast Q2 non-GAAP operating margin between 26.9% and 27.6% or 35 basis points of year-over-year improvement at the midpoint. This is consistent with historical seasonality, where Q1 is usually the high point for operating margin, followed by a sequential decline in Q2, reflecting both the seasonal decrease in volumes and the ramp-up in product and full-funnel marketing investments.\n We expect to generate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.10 and $1.15 in the second quarter, representing non-GAAP EPS growth between 6% and 11% year-over-year. Based on current rates, FX would represent a headwind of roughly 2.5 percentage points.\n Moving to the full year. We continue to plan our business assuming no fundamental change in the macro environment this year. Within this context, we expect our FX-neutral GMV to turn positive in Q3 or Q4. We expect revenue to outpace GMV growth by approximately 2 points for the full year on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, FX represents close to a 1 point expected headwind to total spot revenue growth.\n We maintain our outlook for non-GAAP operating margin to expand by 60 to 100 basis points for the full year. Where we land in this range could vary based on investment opportunities we see throughout the year, not necessarily our volume trends alone. At current rates, we continue to expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of roughly 50 basis points to operating margins, which is mostly offset by an expected tailwind of 40 basis points primarily driven by the change in accounting estimate associated with the extension of the useful life of servers and networking equipment.\n For the full year, we project capital expenditures to be between 4% and 5% of revenue, in line with our historical average. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain stable at 16.5%. We expect just under $2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 with the majority generated in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our free cash flow has been temporarily pressured in recent years by scheduled repatriation payments and changes to the tax treatment of R&D expenses, which will largely alleviate after 2025. From a timing perspective, our federal cash tax payments will revert to a normal schedule this year with our largest outlay occurring in Q2, leading to a more normalized cadence of free cash flow.\n From a capital allocation standpoint, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share for Q2 to be paid in June. For the full year, we are targeting share repurchases of just over $2 billion. Given our better-than-expected Q1 results and our confidence in our strategy and execution, we are increasing our forecast for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to 9% to 11% year-over-year in 2024.\n In closing, Q1 was a strong quarter for eBay as we exceeded our outlook across our key financial metrics. Our results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid persistent challenges in the global economy. We remain on track to achieve positive GMV growth this year in Q3 or Q4, driven by our accelerating pace of innovation across focus categories and horizontal initiatives. In addition, we are laser-focused on further improving our cost discipline and efficiency and expect operating margin expansion this year, even as we make incremental investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth. As a result, we plan to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year at the midpoint of our guidance and exceed our original 3-year target for total capital returns.\n With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Nathan, I'll take that. Steve here. Our Q2 guide implies margin expansion between 0 and 70 basis points year-over-year, depending on where we land in the range. That's really driven by underlying advertising growth efficiency gains, partly offset by some of the investments we've talked about and some FX headwinds that we're seeing. You're right, there's a bit of seasonality that we deal with as we go through the year. The second quarter does generally have sequential contraction. That's in line with the last few years because seasonally, Q1 is our strongest quarter for operating margin due to relatively higher GMV and low expenses.\n A few of the puts and takes that we're seeing, the first thing I would say is that we continue to lean in, in investment. We see a lot of opportunity for good ROI as we are continuing to be committed to growing GMV in either third or the fourth quarter of next year, and we're seeing benefits associated with that. Secondly, there's a couple of dynamics with regards to advertising. In Q2 of 2023, we saw changes in terms of the Halo attribution, which really sort of saw significant momentum in our first-party ads in the second quarter of 2023. And in addition, we saw some revenue recognition changes in the second quarter, about $9 million that was pulled forward.\n So we're sort of dealing with those 2 dynamics. But as you've seen from our prepared remarks, we continue to be confident in the outlook, and we continue to guide margin expansion through 2024 between 60 and 100 basis points as we look forward to going through the rest of the year. Yes, of course. So Bryan, I think there's a couple of things I'd say. First of all, our size, our scale and our financial architecture with eBay with the strength of the balance sheet we have is a distinct advantage for us, particularly as we look to exploit generative AI and the benefits that come from that. With regards to how we're thinking about it from a CapEx and an OpEx standpoint, all of the investment that we've talked about in 2024 from a CapEx standpoint is embedded in the 4% to 5% of revenue, which we've guided for the full year.\n In terms of the OpEx investments associated with generative AI and everything that comes from that, that is contemplated in both our earnings and margin architecture that we've laid out. And in terms of revenue contribution, that's sort of embedded in the work that we've done and is enabling us to put the margin accretion up on the board between 60 and 100 basis points for 2024. And it will also give us benefits, as Jamie has talked about, for years to come as we improve trust and momentum on the overall platform. Thanks, Jamie. Obviously, we made a difficult decision at the start of the year to go through the reduction in force. From the magnitude of the headcount and the restructuring charges, it's obviously a significant event for us. It was not just about sort of driving cost savings and creating capacity. It was also about sort of driving greater agility, speed in decision-making across the organization, so we can continue to deliver for our customers.\n As it pertains to the value of that, that, along with other savings that we continue to drive through operational efficiencies, through our structural cost program that we've been running through for a few years, it is creating the capacity for us to invest back into the business to stimulate sort of customer stickiness and also to drive long-term sustainable growth. It is contemplated in the 60 to 100 basis points of margin expansion that we've laid out for the full year and obviously, a critical part of the earnings momentum that we're expecting to see with double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint of our guide."

            "name": "Jamie Iannone",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered strong results in Q1, even as we continue to navigate ongoing challenges in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was roughly flat at $18.6 billion, while revenue grew more than 2% to $2.56 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%, non-GAAP earnings per share rose 13% to $1.25, and we returned $638 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for delivering these results as they remain relentlessly focused on reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts. And I am pleased that we remain on track for GMV growth to turn positive by Q3 or Q4 of this year.\n Now let's walk through some of the key drivers of our quarterly results. Focus categories play an important part in delivering relevant experiences to customers on eBay and remained a significant driver of underlying growth on our marketplace during Q1. Overall, focus category GMV grew nearly 5% last quarter, outpacing the remainder of our marketplace by roughly 6 points. Motors parts and accessories, or P&A, was once again the largest contributor to growth among focus categories despite facing headwinds in January due to extreme weather patterns in the U.S. Our teams continue to innovate on the P&A shopping experience, growing awareness, enhancing trust and expanding the great inventory our marketplace has to offer.\n Fitment is a central component of trust within the P&A category, helping customers understand exactly which of our more than 600 million live listings in this category fit their vehicle. We continue to work closely with large P&A sellers to augment their inventory using the MyFitment tool kit. To date, we have enhanced eligible auto parts with approximately 5 billion pieces of incremental fitment data, and we've continued to see a double-digit increase in conversion on these augmented listings.\n Additionally, last quarter, we redesigned our self-service experience to simplify how sellers onboard, view and publish fitment data for P&A listings. Our updated experience better serves small- and medium-sized businesses, which make up our largest cohort of P&A sellers.\n On the buyer side, we continue to improve our value proposition for mass-market P&A shoppers looking to maintain their vehicles. During Q1, we added a Motors DIY guide page that makes do-it-yourself projects more accessible by integrating expert content for common maintenance jobs alongside eBay listings for the specific parts, tools and materials needed to complete them. Our full-funnel approach to marketing has increased awareness and consideration of eBay as a trusted place to shop for auto parts and accessories. And I'm excited that yesterday, we announced a multiyear partnership with the McLaren Racing Formula 1 team, which means motor sports enthusiasts around the world will see eBay branding on McLaren team race cars starting with the Miami Grand Prix this week.\n EBay has been a leading player in collectibles for over 2 decades. And in recent years, we've accelerated the pace of innovation in areas like trading cards, which is one of our focus categories. We've rolled out new features like [ My Collections ], price guides, authentication and grading partnerships, revamped condition standards, live commerce, vault storage and new shipping methods to reduce costs.\n In Q1, we continued to innovate by launching a simplified listing flow for sports trading cards to all U.S. sellers. This experience leverages our proprietary technology to [ prefill ] the listing with relevant item aspects, provide simpler shipping options and offer smarter pricing recommendations based on the value and the condition of the card. This rollout has resulted in a double-digit percentage reduction in listing time and measurable increases in completed listings and sold items per customer. We are also seeing a more than 20% increase in CSAT for U.S. sports trading card sellers versus our baseline prior to this rollout.\n In recent quarters, we've seen improving volume trends in trading cards as many of the new and returning hobbyists who joined eBay during the pandemic remain highly engaged with our platform. With so much enthusiasm in the hobby, it's the perfect time to talk about the definitive agreement we announced a few weeks ago with Collectors, parent company of PSA, which is the gold standard in third-party authentication and grading of trading cards and collectibles.\n EBay and Collectors have entered into 3 separate transactions designed to streamline and improve the overall experience for hobbyists. As part of this deal, I'm incredibly excited to welcome Ken Goldin to eBay. We have agreed to acquire Goldin, a leading U.S.-based auction house for high-value collectibles, which brings together 2 renowned marketplace brands in the trading card hobby. Many of you know Ken from his fantastic series on Netflix, King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch. Combining Goldin with eBay enhances our respective marketplace offerings by expanding the range of inventory available to eBay customers and opening up an expansive global audience for Goldin sellers. We believe this will enable a more well-rounded collecting experience across price points and service models, complementing our acquisition of TCGplayer and recent partnership with sports trading card company COMC.\n Additionally, eBay has entered into commercial agreements with Collectors and PSA to reduce friction in the authentication and grading of trading cards. We also agreed to divest the eBay vault to PSA. Through a newly branded service offering, our companies plan to launch an integrated program to buy, sell, grade and store trading cards. EBay will become PSA's exclusive marketplace partner for trading cards, enabling hobbyists to more easily list and sell their cars on eBay at the time of grading.\n Importantly, these deals enable each company to prioritize what it does best. At eBay, we can focus on enhancing our marketplace and streamlining the buying and selling experience for millions of hobbyists, while collectors can concentrate on its operational expertise in grading, authenticating and securely storing collectibles. There'll be more we can share about our company's joint plans after the deals close, which we expect to occur during Q2, subject to closing conditions.\n In Q1, we also continued to rapidly innovate on our eBay Live experience, which now spans multiple categories, including collectibles. We expanded coverage to new categories like comics and sports memorabilia. We introduced a revamped auctions experience that makes bidding more seamless and reliable. We enabled viewing on desktop so that buyers can join live events wherever they are shopping. And we dramatically improved the event discoverability on the home page with personalized recommendations. While eBay Live remains in beta, we are extremely excited about continuing to scale this experience throughout the year.\n As a pioneer of recommerce, giving pre-owned goods a second life is core to who we are as a company. We reached a major milestone in Q1 as pre-owned and refurbished goods reached 40% of total GMV on our marketplace after consistently outpacing the sales of brand-new goods since the pandemic. In service of that mission, a major priority in 2024 is strengthening our consumer value proposition in pre-owned fashion. Through our multiyear partnership with Love Island in the U.K., we have grown awareness of the sustainability benefits of recommerce and educated consumers on the potential economic savings from shopping for pre-owned items. But there is more we can do to unlock consumers' closets and accelerate the circular economy.\n To that end, last month, we began to dramatically streamline the buying and selling experiences for pre-owned fashion on eBay, focusing on the U.K. We redesigned our shopping experience from the ground up to reduce friction and better meet the needs of modern fashion consumers. Our initial rollout included a number of features and improvements such as a simplified selling flow, curated item specifics, photo guidance, intelligent pricing suggestions and condensed shipping options.\n We also eliminated final value fees on pre-owned apparel for C2C sellers in the U.K. and introduced new AI-powered tools to enhance discovery and drive more inspirational shopping behavior on our marketplace. One such feature is explore a new AI-powered shopping feed, enabling users to browse a nearly unlimited list of personalized recommendations based on implicit and explicit interest signals, such as the users' style preferences and sizes. The explore feed updates in real time in response to products that users interact with, while buyers can refine their shopping journey using our visually similar search feature powered by computer vision. Explore is focused on fashion to start, and we plan to expand its capabilities later this year. Explore is currently live for all U.K. users in beta alongside small pilots in other countries as we gather feedback and insights.\n In April, we also rolled out an early version of shop the look, which leverages generative AI to create shoppable content and fashion recommendations. Shop the look showcases a variety of styles such as business casual, Scandinavian minimalism or urban athleisure. Recommended outlets are linked to visually similar products on eBay, drawing from our hundreds of millions of live listings in fashion. Shop the look is live in iOS in the U.S. and U.K., and we will evolve this experience throughout 2024 based on customer feedback, including additional styles, greater diversity of outfits and increased user control over personalization.\n Next, I'd like to go deeper on the transformative power of AI. Last quarter, I talked about the meaningful strides we've taken in establishing eBay as a leader in generative AI for e-commerce. In Q1, we doubled our GPU capacity versus the end of 2023, which enabled our teams to accelerate our training and fine-tuning of foundational large language models to power a number of eBay features and services. In addition to powering consumer-facing features like explore, shop the look, magical listing and background enhancement, we're increasingly leveraging generative AI to change how we work, driving meaningful productivity and efficiency improvements across our organization.\n A prime example of this is within our Global Customer Experience organization, or GCX. We are in the midst of a multiyear journey to transform our GCX capabilities using technology. Our north star for customer service is not just to reduce cost, but meaningfully improve the quality of interactions. Recently, we implemented generative AI technology that supports our GCX teammates by analyzing incoming communications to create a simple summary of customers' needs and intent. This technology automatically extracts relevant solutions and next steps from an LLM fine-tuned using our comprehensive knowledge base and policy documents. We are now able to present solutions and a clear and concise structure to our GCX team, allowing them to quickly provide customers with the help and support they need, improving the accuracy, consistency and quality of support. With tens of millions of live customer contacts annually, these efficiencies should yield meaningful cost savings for our GCX organization.\n Generative AI tools are also improving our developer productivity and accelerating our overall tech velocity. Last year, we made GitHub Copilot available to all of our developers and saw encouraging results. We observed measurable improvements in productivity, along with code acceptance and accuracy. Nearly 3/4 of our developers now use Copilot every day. In parallel, we began building internal tools to streamline our development processes and improve efficiency. We fine-tuned an open-source LLM with eBay's codebase and other internal data to develop a proprietary coding assistant that has been incredibly helpful in labor-intensive areas like code migration and software upkeep. For instance, we estimate these tools can reduce the time required for code migration by as much as 20%.\n We also created an internal GPT specifically for developers that answers thousands of questions per week, serving as a knowledge base for our internal documentation. Overall, we're still early in our generative AI productivity journey, but these are just a few examples of proprietary tools we've introduced to our GCX and technology teams that are already yielding tangible benefits.\n Turning to advertising. Our ads business continued to deliver healthy growth at scale while improving velocity and price realization for our sellers at compelling return on ad spend levels. During Q1, first-party advertising grew 28%, while total ad revenue represented 2.1% of GMV. During the quarter, over 3 million sellers adopted a single ad product, and we ended the quarter with over 950 million live Promoted Listings.\n Our standard cost per acquisition units remain the largest contributor to year-over-year ad revenue growth in Q1, followed by our cost per click advanced product. We are also seeing promising results from some Promoted Listing products in beta. One such product that's continued to gain traction in beta is Offsite Ads. This off-eBay solution enables sellers to more actively participate in extending the reach of their listings through CPC ads placed on external services. This product leverages eBay's decades of advertising technology investment on behalf of those sellers, enabling advanced targeting, campaign management and pricing optimization. We expanded our go-to-market efforts for Offsite Ads towards the end of last year, and this product emerged as a material contributor to first-party ad revenue growth in Q1. We have ambitious road map to further optimize these ad units and increase seller adoption throughout 2024.\n Now let's turn to impact. The eBay community continues to impress us with their generosity. Last quarter, eBay for Charity enabled sellers and buyers to raise more than $46 million, up 18% year-over-year. We also recently published our eighth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. With our purpose of connecting people and building communities to create economic opportunity for all, we know diversity makes us a better and stronger place to work, sell and buy.\n Among the highlights from our 2023 DE&I report was the launch of our first-ever inclusion index, which helps us gain a stronger understanding of our employee experience, measure our progress over time and determine how we can better support our employees as a workplace.\n Our Communities of Inclusion, our internal eBay resource groups, also remained an integral part of what we do. In 2023, our 11 COIs hosted more than 360 global events, reaching more than 17,000 attendees during the year. And finally, for the eighth year in a row, we've concluded our gender pay equity study, and I'm proud to report our gender pay ratio remained consistent at just over 100% globally.\n In closing, Q1 marked a strong start to 2024 as we exceeded our financial targets and continued to make progress toward our goal of long-term sustainable GMV growth. Focus categories maintained significant momentum despite ongoing macro pressure on discretionary e-commerce. After many quarters of consistent innovation in focus categories like luxury, P&A, refurbished, sneakers and streetwear, we are bringing our innovation playbook to pre-owned fashion in the U.K. to simplify selling, drive inspirational shopping and promote the circular economy.\n Our agreement with Collectors would further strengthen our value proposition for hobbyists as we streamline the process of buying, selling, grading and storing trading cards. And we believe our advancements in generative AI are fundamentally changing the customer experience on eBay, increasing productivity across our organization and ultimately driving more value for shareholders. Our momentum and excelling pace of innovation are a testament to the incredible work of our employees, who continue to execute our strategic road map and service of our customers.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you. Yes. I'd really say it's threefold, Colin. I'd say first is the focus category work that we're doing. You see us not only kind of expanding what we're doing there, but investing in categories that we've already launched before like what we announced in collectibles with the Collectors and Goldin this quarter, what we're seeing in terms of the growth of luxury, of P&A, refurbished at 5%. So that's probably the first thing I'd say.\n The second is just the geo work that we're doing in specific geographies. If you look at the work that we did in Germany on C2C, we continue to see healthy returns from that. We're more than a year from launching that. We launched that in Q1 of last year, and we're continuing to see positive C2C momentum in Germany and healthy metrics and encouraging numbers from our CSAT standpoint. So that's the second.\n And the third I would say is the efforts that we have against our horizontal innovations. So we've talked about things like magical listing, of simplifying the selling flow. We continue to invest in search, in CRM and a number of horizontal initiatives. I'd call out 2 that we talked about this quarter, which are explore and shop the look, new AI capabilities that we're launching first in fashion to really create a new browsing experience. So all 3 of those together is what gives us the confidence in moving forward and how we feel good about what we put out there. Yes. Look, our cross-border is one of our great strengths as a business. 1 in 5 transactions or about 20% of GMV goes across borders on eBay, and it's very strategic for us in that for sellers, it opens up a very vast demand opportunity. We've talked for a couple of quarters about eBay International Shipping as an example of one of those things. We've talked about our payments team investing in buyer and seller FX to make that more easy and take the friction out for customers.\n So you take, for example, a look at parts and accessories, which continues to perform well at mid-single digits, one of the largest contributors to that growth is really healthy CBT business. You look at luxury being positive even in this macro environment. And it's in part because of the work we're doing where we launched an authentication center in Japan, and we have great inventory coming out of there.\n So it's one of the benefits that we have from a global marketplace. We think we're unique from that perspective in terms of what we offer, in terms of the capability for sellers, and we're pleased with what we're seeing in the growth of CBT overall. Yes. Tom, thanks for the question. Look, we continue to operate in a really dynamic environment given the macro challenges globally with inflationary pressures and interest rates. We talked about Q1 started off a bit softer because of some of the weather, but then we had a reasonably good tax period. I would say the backdrop remains weaker in Europe than it does in the U.S., where U.S. is in better shape. If you look at e-commerce growth rates in U.K. and Germany this quarter, they're negative, and that's overall, and obviously, we play more in discretionary than consumables.\n So I think this is where our model is really winning, right? Our model is working because we have global demand. We've really focused in on non-new-in-season over the last couple of years. And we can provide value in a marketplace like this. We can be a great avenue for selling in terms of consumer demand. And I think it's why we reached the milestone this year or this quarter of now 40% of our inventory is pre-loved or refurbished is because we're seeing strength from the value proposition that we've built, and it's resonating with the consumer. Yes. Look, we're really excited by the advancements that we're making in AI. I feel somewhat of a privilege to be able to lead this company because when you think of the breadth of categories, the data that we have for over 20 years, the scale of the size of business, being able to put AI against those is really compelling. So on the consumer-facing side, we continue to see amazing traction with magical listing. It's now -- writes description for 100% of users across native, desktop, mWeb, and we're working on Phase 2 there. We've got that rolled out to a percentage of sellers, which is great.\n When you look at explore and shop the look, those are 2 features that, starting with fashion, are really bringing a whole new browse experience to eBay. If you think about it, our fashion category on eBay is over $10 billion, and we have amazing inventory and incredible values. But if you wanted to put an outfit together on eBay, the buyer had to do all that work for the last 20 years. And most of them did, and we built a really healthy business. Now we can use AI to basically do all of that hard work for the consumer. And depending on their style, which they tell us or we infer based on their sizing, we can put the right products in front of them directly.\n So we're really excited by the potential of what we're seeing, by the acceptance that we have. When you look at magical listing, 90% of customers that use and accept what we put together, which is fantastic, and also just the interest from our consumers. Steve, maybe you want to talk a little bit about financially? Yes. Look, we're excited by what we're seeing in trading cards. What we saw is that there was obviously a lot of activity during the pandemic, and we were able to hold on to a lot of customers that we acquired and frankly, a lot of customers that got reactivated or reinterested into the hobby. When you look at collectibles, we've been investing in it over quite some time. We've launched a number of features, whether it's price guides, making it easier, [ My Collections ] on the marketplace, we've launched new shipping forms, we've introduced authentication in that product, et cetera, and really built the suite of what collectors were asking us to do.\n And then this quarter, as you saw a few weeks ago, the 3-part agreement that we've developed with Collectors really takes that to the next level. And frankly, this is something that collectors have been asking us to do, which is, hey, we create real value in getting our cards graded. We love selling them on eBay. How could we make that whole process easier? And when you look at the 3 separate deals that we put together, that's exactly what we intended to do with trading cards.\n So we're bringing in the Goldin platform, excited to bring Ken and his team in. This is going to bring really unique inventory, frankly, the world's most desirable inventory into the platform. Like they sold a Honus Wagner card for $7 million. It was the third most expensive trading card ever sold. Michael Jordan sneakers that sold for $1.4 million. There's this great book of the [ Goldin 100 ]. And we're just excited to have this new high-touch, white-glove experience available to sellers and to bring a global reach now for Goldin sellers on the marketplace.\n And then when you look at the commercial agreements, making it easier to buy, sell, trade and grade on the platform through an integrated experience is a great opportunity because clearly, a lot of collectors buy ungraded cards on eBay that they want to get graded or they've just graded a card or they realize the value based on the grade they have that they want to sell it. And so our ability to do this really helps grow the industry. It helps grow the hobby, and it's really what collectors have been asking us to do. So I'm really excited about what it means for the collecting and the future here at eBay. Yes. Look, the reason that we have such good seller metrics and sellers are so loyal, Richard, is because we let them build a brand on eBay. They build an eBay store, they have a presence, and we bring them a lot of really unique value propositions. We bring them the scale and breadth of global buyers on the marketplace. We bring them all of the capabilities to market and advertise their products really easily. We just -- we've been working the last couple of quarters on this product I talked about with Offsite Ads, which helps them bring traffic back. And so it's really -- those are really, I think, important to sellers. And what we see is really good feedback from doing those.\n And what we're doing in the U.K., U.K. is a unique market for us. We have very strong awareness and we're a leading player in recommerce. But we view the pre-loved fashion category as really a gateway to recommerce. Pre-owned apparel shoppers are really valuable to our business. And what we see is that 30% of our C2C sellers actually sell in pre-owned apparel. So given the strategic nature, we not only looked at what we could do to drive that velocity with the fee structure that we outlined, but we built about 10 different discrete features in that launch, from a streamlined listing flow where there's much simpler shipping options, for example, we simplified item aspects to just the relevant fields, we now offer photo guidance in a really compelling way, including better image removal and background swap, changed the default. So did a lot of things to make the selling process easier while launching explore and shop the look on the buying side to really take advantage of a much more modern experience for shopping for fashion on eBay. Yes. So look, it's been an important strategic area for us. One of the reasons we launched eBay International Shipping was the whole concept that we wanted you to be able to ship a product from LA to Norway, and it would be as easy as shipping it from LA to Chicago. And we built that product, and eBay takes care of all of the hard work and the background of customs, duties, et cetera. And we're seeing really great feedback in terms of the CSAT and the performance that we're getting from our sellers from that perspective. We built a lot of features like buyer and seller FX, so that the buyer can transact in their currency of choice to make that really easy for the -- for both the buyer and for the seller.\n When you look at the categories and what we have, it's really across the board. And it's really aligned with our focus category strategy that we have. So whether that's parts and accessories and being able to generate great parts and accessories in different parts of the world and ship them around the world, even to unique parts that may be manufactured in one country that there may be global demand from that perspective.\n We talked about handbags being another example in luxury where there's inventory coming out of, for example, Japan. It's a great market for handbags. By putting authentication center there, that now opens up global demand for the great inventory that sits there. And really, when you think about it, there's great inventory in a lot of our categories all across the world. And what we really focus on is how to open that up.\n When you think about the scale of a $73 billion platform where 1 in 5 transactions is going across borders, the scale of that means that it's broad, it's very diverse from that perspective. And we have 2 billion live listings on the platform. So really just about every category on the platform benefits from the work we've done in cross-border and making that simpler and easier for our customers."
