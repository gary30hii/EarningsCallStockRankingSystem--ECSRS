And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax; and Jamere Jackson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer-Elect. Jamere who joined us just last week will be observing only today, but we are so glad to have him here and part of our great team. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with our slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late May, much of the world\u2019s attention has been on COVID-19, its current and short-term implications and trying to evaluate the long-term ramifications of this pandemic. During Q3\u2019s conference call, we shared the incredible volatility we experienced during the third quarter, with three very distinct performance periods. Pre-COVID, where our same-store sales were up about 6% or so, and then the midst of the stay-at-home orders where our comps were down over 20% and then the last four weeks where our performance was in the low-teens following the stimulus checks and at the beginning of the enhanced unemployment benefits. We shared last quarter that our retail sales increased an incredible 50% one week from a Monday to a Wednesday. This quarter\u2019s sales story was very different. It was quite consistent and consistently, very, very strong. While last quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced, this quarter marked another milestone. AutoZone enjoyed its largest quarterly same-store sales performance since going public in 1991, 22% -- 22% same-store sales growth, and that introduced new unfamiliar challenges. With the significant increase in customer traffic in our retail and commercial sales, we had to intensely focus on ensuring the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, and that took a tremendous amount of creativity on the part of our team. Our supply chain, specifically our distribution centers, our vendor partners and their operations were and continue to be under immense pressure to keep up with the surge in demand we have experienced over the last five months. Our in-stock positions today aren\u2019t up to our usual high standards and we are working diligently to get recover, but our supply chain wasn\u2019t built for 25% excess capacity. I have mentioned often that our sales are pretty predictable staying in a very tight band. Well, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth since stimulus money began to flow. That said, our sales in both retail and commercial were high, but very consistent from the beginning of our quarter in early May through July. We were anxious to see what happened to our sales performance in August, after the enhanced unemployment benefits subsided. We are very happy to report that our domestic same-store sales in August, while down some from May through July were still up a remarkable 16.5%. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as they are always are, but all of our regions performed well. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the first quarter and fiscal \u201821. It remains very difficult for us to predict. Based on our performance post-enhanced unemployment, we feel our sales will remain elevated for some time, and typically, in recessionary environments, we performed well, but nothing, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There is simply too many remaining unknowns, will the federal government\u2019s 300 hours enhanced unemployment benefit be sufficient? How long will it last? Will there be an effective vaccine, and if so, when? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which once have changed permanently? And many, many more questions. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long-term to-date, we don\u2019t see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks, the strongest periods we have experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811, all coming out of recessionary periods. This is why we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized sales growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retain many of those customers in the years that follow. We always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team continues to do has really been exceptional. I applaud our entire organization each and every AutoZoners across the enterprise from Hawaii to South Paulo from ALLDATA to our DataZone facility in Mexico. Every AutoZoners has had to learn new ways to work, new ways to meet and exceed the wants, needs and desires of our customers, and everyone has met, embraced and delivered on that challenge. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the phenomenal team I have the honor of working alongside. I especially want to call out and on behalf of every AutoZoner, recognize our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been thrown many, many curveballs in the last six months and they have met every challenge with tremendous ingenuity, courage, innovation and passion. Most importantly, they have continued to deliver an exceptional service experience for our customers. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every single day. Now let\u2019s move into our performance for the quarter. Same-store sales were up 21.8% versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our net income was $740 million and our EPS was $30.93 a share, 36.9% above last year. Excluding the extra week in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, our EPS was up an amazing 47.6%. Regarding our sales performance, while the consistency from week-to-week was predictable, the volume of business was the outlier this quarter. Our sales were much higher than we could have forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year and they sustained higher levels than we would have predicted on our last call in May. While our retail business was stronger than our commercial business, both businesses had week-to-week consistent sales performance. Our DIY same-store sales were up approximately 24%. Our share growth in retail over the last four months on the detailed information we have available for our broadest set of competitors shows that we have been gaining much, much more share than at any time before in both units and dollars. Our commercial business total sales were up approximately 17% on a 16-week basis. In commercial, we averaged over $60 million in weekly sales, which was over $12,200 in sales per program per week, both new records for us. Candidly, we are most proud to highlight that we continue to live up to our stated values when it came to taking care of our AutoZoners. During our third quarter, we announced that all eligible hourly, full and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time-off benefits and it would be available immediately. Remember back to that time, at that time, we didn\u2019t wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by government. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the frontlines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time-off, including for the first time in our history, providing eligible part-timers with paid time-off up to 40 hours. This additional time-off can be used as the AutoZoner desires, and if they don\u2019t use it between now and the calendar year-end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren\u2019t comfortable coming to work. Others had childcare issues. Others were simply anxious. While the vast majority were comfortable continuing to come to work and providing great service to our customers in their time of need. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values. In the fourth quarter, we extended these emergency time-off benefits to our store managers and distribution center advisors, each of whom have been on the frontline, supporting and leading their teams through this extraordinary season. We were honored to be able to make these investments in our AutoZoners in recognition of what they have done and continue to do for our customers and our organization. Overall, this quarter sales were a record for us, but it is simply impossible and would be irresponsible to extrapolate these results going forward. With so many variables heading into the fall, we continue to manage the business literally from week-to-week and our field organization continues to do an outstanding job managing the business. As we said on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect that our sales growth will moderate over time. But we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. One thing that we are sure about, our team has shown their resiliency and they remain nimble. They are ready to react quickly to every single change. We remain focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge, and our AutoZoners have definitely and continue to put our customers first. While geographic differences weren\u2019t a significant story this quarter, there continued to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories specifically in the retail business. We continue to see some surprisingly strong categories that I will call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. We believe that with people having more time on their hands and many having more discretionary money due to the enhanced unemployment benefits, often making more than they were making before or a lack of spending on entertainment-type categories, customers are working on their quote, project car or doing that enhancement job they have been constantly putting off. At the same time, we noted that certain product lines grew at a slower rate compared to the chain average. Merchandise categories like brakes, rotors or even motor oil, while up from pre-COVID levels aren\u2019t growing at the same rate as the overall store. We believe these categories maybe impacted by the decrease in miles driven and in the brake categories, specifically, the lack of severe winter weather last year. Now let\u2019s turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 33 basis points. Included in our cost of goods this quarter was a shift of mix and 9 basis points of headwind due to civil unrest expenses. In addition, we have also identified select categories that are more commodity based, which are less dependent upon service that we have lowered prices in order to be more effectively compete with our non-traditional competitors to increase volumes. On operating expenses, our team particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses during these times well. As our sales accelerated drastically in a very short period of time, we didn\u2019t have the available labor to achieve our desired staffing labels until later in the quarter. So we wish we could have spent more on labor to provide an even better customer experience. Our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year\u2019s Q4 excluding the extra week due to our very strong sales results, we were able to leverage operating expenses 315 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were approximately $11 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses. While the last two quarters expenses related to COVID have been significant, as we visit stores and distribution centers and talk to our team, this decision strengthen our already unique and powerful culture, and show that this organization walks the talk. We believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was up a bit and our cash and cash equivalents were up dramatically. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.6 billion is excess cash. Increasing our debt levels, adding a new 364-day line of credit and increasing excess cash were purposeful, as we wanted to maximize our liquidity position due to the significant uncertainty. We also felt we managed our inventory well as our inventory per store growth increased 1.3% versus Q4 last year. We feel our strong liquidity position heading into the fall months allows us immense flexibility when it comes to thoughtfully reinstituting our share repurchase program. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program in March. It was certainly the right decision. At the time, as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world, our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be so. We expect to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We intend to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we did in March, if we have concerns about the near-term, we can and will temporarily suspend repurchases again, which is one of the significant benefits of a share repurchase program versus a dividend approach of returning capital to shareholders. We expect to maintain an elevated level of cash and cash equivalents throughout most of this new fiscal year. In regard to our CapEx spend during the quarter. We spent less this year than last year. We paused our development on many stores during the depths of the stay-at-home orders, which slowed our ability to complete construction and open new stores. As a result, we finished this year with 113 new U.S. stores versus 154 last year and we opened only 25 stores across all of Mexico and Brazil for the year. For 2021, we would expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic new stores and roughly 50 international stores. I will spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID\u2019s effect on consumer\u2019s ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter we continued to see very strong growth in our online shopping channels, buy online, pickup in store, next-day delivery and ship to home. In particular, our buy online pickup in-store offering grew rapidly at 4 times the growth rate of the ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that our online sales still represent a very, very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. While online purchasing is a smaller business for us, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pickup. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough and I am confident that I speak on behalf of our shareholders too, and say, thank you. AutoZoners, you truly delivered on AutoZone\u2019s promise to provide exceptional customer service. Now I will turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill?\nBill Giles: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about both our domestic and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores increased 14.2%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1.914 million. This compares to an average of $1.847 million at Q4 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased on a 16-week basis 16.8% to $976 million, an amazing number this quarter reached several records for us. In the quarter sales through our DIFM customers represented 21.5% of our total sales, an increase approximately $89 million from last year\u2019s Q4. Last year did have the extra week and excluding that week, our sales were up $140.4 million, our weekly sales program were $12,250 and they were up 14.2% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As we open fewer program this year at 114 finishing with 5007 total programs, our sales efficacy per store has never been higher. Not only was $12,250 a week record for us, but we were able to average $60 million in total weekly commercial sales, an amazing accomplishment. While we know many of the industry participants remain comfortably ahead of us currently, we know we are on the right path. This past year, we again believe our sales increases were materially better than the overall industry and will remain focused on repeating this in FY\u201921. I should take a moment to discuss four major things that are making a real difference for us when it comes to commercial. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiative. One major example of this is adding to the number of mega hub locations. These stores have been opened five this quarter and now numbering 44 in total substantially increased local market availability. Mega hubs lift our sales noticeably in the markets where they open. With over 80,000 SKUs or more available same day and even multiple times per day from these mega hub markets, we are able to say, yes, materially more than when compared to carrying 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs from a hub. Second, we are improving our service. We are delivering faster and we are supporting our customers with their overall needs better than before. We recently began rolling out new technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, we have got our stores managers to buy in to our commercial sales initiatives. They are not only involved with the commercial effort but they are fully onboard with driving sales calls and improving our service to our commercial customers. They now own the commercial business in their store. And fourth, we continue to rollout initiatives that make us much easier to do business with. We now have our commercial program in 5,007 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic this past quarter. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 21.91 to the dollar and was roughly 15% higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were down for the quarter versus last year. During the quarter we opened 11 new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts are short-term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 43 stores. We opened five new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced immense challenges with COVID-19 and stay-at-home mandates. In fact, many of our stores in Brazil were focused or forced to be closed for weeks like our stores in Puerto Rico. In both markets, our AutoZoners were very creative and quickly implemented drive-through no contact service. You should have seen the lines of cars. Currently, we view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.1% of sales, down 31 basis points versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. This past quarter\u2019s gross margin included approximately $4 million and charges related to damage from civil unrest. The increase in gross -- the decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower merchandise margins driven primarily by a shift in mix. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 30.7% of sales, leveraging 338 basis points to last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. Our SG&A grew 9.2% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred a net $10.7 million in charges related to our offering emergency time-off and additional direct COVID expenses. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick-up, we would expect the spend rate to increase, and as previously mentioned, at times, we haven\u2019t been able to adequately staff to the increase in volume, as our staffing levels have increased so will our labor cost. EBIT for the quarter was $1.18 million. Our EBIT margin was 22.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 14% from Q4 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and a $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the third quarter. We are planning interest at $48 million for the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 versus $43.7 million in last year\u2019s quarter. Our higher forecast than last year is driven, again by the costs associated with the new bond issuance and 1 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.513 billion or $307 million above last year\u2019s Q4 ending balance of $5.206 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9 times EBITDA. Our lower-than-normal credit metric reflects the temporary suspension of share repurchase program. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. In the long -- in long-term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.3% versus 21.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 35 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 107 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the first quarter of FY\u201921, we suggest investors to model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to report a stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $740 million, up was 41.2% versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter when excluding the 17th week. Our diluted share count of 23.9 million was lower by 4.3% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $30.93, up 47.6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter excluding the extra week. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.417 billion of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $600 million over last year\u2019s Q4 with an extra week. Net fixed assets were up 2.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $183.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 65 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,885 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 43 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,549. Depreciation totaled $125.4 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s expense of $118.5 million. This is generally in line is generally in line with recent growth rates. We did not repurchase any AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $692 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 1.9 times. As Bill mentioned earlier, we had suspended our share repurchase program, as we continue to evaluate cash flow generation and the economy as a whole. At this stage, based on current conditions and the strength of our business, we expect to be utilizing our free cash flow generated each quarter in order to opportunistically start buying back -- our program back up. It remains and will remain a core tool to our model, as we believe it is a terrific flexible way to return excess cash flow after appropriately investing in our business to our shareholders. Next I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 3.6% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $683,000 versus $674,000 last year and $685,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandized inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $104,000 versus a negative $85,000 last year and a negative $56,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 115.3% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 112.6%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 38.1%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Bill. These continue to be unique and unprecedented times and they have required us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We don\u2019t know what lies ahead of us for this new fiscal year, but we feel we are much more prepared today for uncertainty than we were at the start of this pandemic. We will be ready for a wide variety of economic environments and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families, drive to a close vacation spot or get back into the school year. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for our upcoming first quarter and the new fiscal year. But as I stated before, that isn\u2019t practical for us with all the unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. Our domestic retail business was a tremendous surprise for us this past quarter. We understand trends will ultimately slow. While we appreciate these things, we feel we are well-positioned for continued future share gain opportunities in both the domestic, retail and commercial segments. We had an outstanding quarter, but we have work to do as we start a new fiscal year. Frankly, our focus isn\u2019t on what happens this new quarter. Its, are we keeping our AutoZoners and customer safe today, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now and I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on our company. Before we proceed to questions, we made some exciting organization announcements a few weeks ago. We announced that Bill Giles and Bill Hackney, two tremendous long-term talented leaders plan to retire at the end of the calendar year. It is impossible to state the tremendous impact each of them have had on our business, our culture and our teams. They will be sorely missed. But in their typical fashion, they always put the company\u2019s interest ahead of their own and they have been sharing with us for a long time that this day would inevitably come. As such, their teams are prepared and we simultaneously announced the addition of two new fabulous leaders to our team. Our new EVP, CFO, Jamere Jackson is with us today and Seong Ohm will be joining us soon as our new Senior Vice President of Merchandising. We are so excited to add these two seasoned highly accomplished leaders to our team. It will be terrific to inject their ideas, thoughts, and perspectives into our future strategies and tactics. We welcome Jamere and Seong, and we look forward to celebrating the enormous contributions of Bill and Bill. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question in the queue is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions and congratulations to everyone on their new roles and [Bill Giles] [ph] good luck on your retirement. Bill Rhodes\u2026\nBill Giles: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you. Bill Rhodes, recognizing that you want to -- you don\u2019t necessarily want to opine on how to think about AutoZone\u2019s sales trends moving forward, but as you think about the period of extraordinary growth that the industry is experiencing right now from those what you categorized as project related items. As that [indiscernible], are you operating under the assumptions that the industry\u2019s sales can return to pre-COVID levels even if vehicle miles driven are structurally lower moving forward?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. I think that is one of those other questions that are really hard to say right now, Michael. And I will go back to, on our last call, if you would have told me that our sales would continue for four months -- additional four months at those elevated levels, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that to be true, but they did. And the biggest news to me was the fact that August still had 16.5% same-store sales growth post-economic stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits. What happens with miles driven will be an element of it. But a lot of the miles that are being driven, they are not all the same. Our customer -- our core customer, their habits haven\u2019t changed. They are still going to work every day. When you think about the miles driven it\u2019s -- that have declined, it\u2019s generally higher socioeconomic groups that are working from home. Our core customers, they haven\u2019t worked at home, just like our store AutoZoners and D.C. AutoZoners. They haven\u2019t worked at home a day. So I don\u2019t think all miles driven are the same. What happens in the next 12 months? Frankly, it\u2019s very, very difficult for us to predict. The piece that I hang on to and we hang on to is, generally when economic times are tough people prioritize their vehicle at a different level because they are not going to get a new vehicle in any short-term period, and therefore, they change their maintenance and upgrade their vehicles. So, as I said earlier, the last -- over the last three decades, the best periods of performance for us have all been coming out of recessionary environments. Will this recessionary environment be the same as those other periods? I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s the best analogy that we have at this point.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up question is on your gross margin. How much did lowering prices on commodity items impact the gross margin in the quarter? Did that have any effect on your ability to gain share seemingly within the commercial side of the business and do you expect to push this strategy further over the next couple of quarters that it will continue to have a lingering impact on the gross margin?\nBill Giles: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Michael. I would start by first saying, most of the gross margin impact was product mix shift. So we had some categories like lighting and brakes that typically have higher margins than our average and those underperformed the quarter. Batteries as an example, outperformed during the quarter and they typically have slightly lower margins than the average. So that\u2019s what drove it a little bit. But, yes, we did provide -- we did find opportunities for us to lower select categories like commodities, where we are really not adding a lot of service and it\u2019s an opportunity for us to be more competitive. And we did gain market share in many of those categories during the quarter. So we think it was the right decision and long-term it will help drive sales and ultimately help drive gross profit. But to dimensionalize it was probably a single-digit basis point impact.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s helpful and best of luck. Thank you.\nBill Giles: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I have a question on sales and then a question on margin. My first question on sales, Bill Rhodes, you mentioned, the 16.5% through August a couple times and I think towards the end of your prepared remarks, you said, sales will ultimately revert back. Is there anything more you can talk about on September, sorry, to be so short-term and if we get CARES 2\u2026\nBill Rhodes: Yeah.\nSimeon Gutman: \u2026do you think we will see a bigger impact in DIY or commercial?\nBill Rhodes: Okay. So you know this, our long history is, we report earnings so quickly after the end of our quarter. Usually three quarters of the year within two and a half weeks at the end of the year because of year [and] [ph] we go three and a half weeks. I just don\u2019t want to talk about trends in September, because I just don\u2019t want people focusing that much attention on such a short period of time. That\u2019s why we were so crystal clear about what happened in August, that we did see a 16.5% comp in August. So I want to leave it at that, Simeon. I understand your desire to hear more but I don\u2019t want us extrapolating two weeks or three weeks.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And then, I guess, I will throw the follow-up and then I don\u2019t know if you have a thought on the -- if CARES 2 will help commercial or DIY more, but the follow-up is also on gross margin. And in the past, I don\u2019t know if you have provided a rule of thumb or the market has that gross margin for AutoZone could be up on average from 10-ish basis points or so a year. Is that still a fair framework, the idea maybe or is there a lower threshold given your reserve the right to invest back in price and then, if it was down a little in 2020 does that mean it could be up a little bit more than sort of typical algorithm in 2021?\nBill Rhodes: Okay. Let me answer your first follow-up question on the CARES Act and then, Bill, will take the gross margin one. As far as the CARES Act, if there was a CARES, I think, it\u2019s now 4 and we provided additional enhanced unemployment benefits. I think you see more of the benefit on the DIY side of the business, because that\u2019s where the most financially fragile customers are. If you look back to what happens every year when tax refunds come out and it\u2019s the DIY business, they both pick up, but the DIY business picks up even more. So I think it would be beneficial on both sides, more beneficial on the DIY side. Bill?\nBill Giles: On the growth side, I would just say that, look we grew gross profit dollars by 20%. Our focus is again on driving gross profit dollars. And so where we can find opportunities to invest back in the business, we are going to do that, and over time, retail and commercial prices will go up and down based on market conditions. So, again, our standpoint is, look, our margin is in a really healthy place right now and we have got great opportunities for us to lower cost through lower acquisition opportunities and so we have -- on a category-by-category basis, we feel really good about where our margin is. There\u2019s always going to be some shift in product sales mix that\u2019s going to impact the margin.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Okay. Thanks Bill and congratulations.\nBill Giles: Thank you, Simeon.\nBill Rhodes: Thanks, Simeon.\nOperator: Next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: Great. Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter, and Bill Giles, congrats on your announced retirement as well. I wanted to focus a little bit more on that 16.5% exit rate, obviously, a very strong trend. Can you just discuss the DIY and commercial trends that you saw as you moved through the quarter? And then the second part of it is, if you can talk about the types of projects that you see getting done and whether you have any concerns that sales are being pulled forward or do you believe that what you have seen is largely projects that had been delayed from earlier in the year? How are you are you thinking about that?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. Some terrific questions in there. As far as the last question of, did we pull projects forward? I think the project work is kind of, I call it, the never doing now category. These are projects that people thought that they would do some time, but they never had the time to do them, and therefore, when they had the time and they had some incremental disposable income they tackled those jumps. I do -- our battery business, as Bill said, has been very, very strong. A lot of the reasons we believe it\u2019s been strong is because a lot of people park their vehicle for some extended period of time. Once they restarted it the battery had been discharged some. So are those some failures that might have happened this coming winter when it got cold? That\u2019s the only piece that I wonder if that might have a bit of a pull-forward. But we will see when we get into next year. What was the first part of your question?\nSeth Sigman: Just the DIY versus commercial trends as you move through the quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. DIY started, I mentioned it, went up 50% in two days back in April and so it ramped really quickly. The commercial business lagged it, but it continued to build very methodically over the course of the quarter. As we got into August, both businesses took a little bit of a step down when that enhanced unemployment benefit went away.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on commercial, I do think the most important trend in the quarter was the strength you saw in commercial, obviously, reflects a lot of the things that you have been doing over the last couple of years. Can you just update us on the hub strategy, frame for us how markets perform when you add a hub to the network? And then how are you thinking about growth of hub locations at this point, particularly given all the disruption in retail and the real estate opportunities that may come up? Thanks.\nBill Giles: Great question, Seth. Yeah. We think that there\u2019s continued opportunity. As we mentioned before, we are going to continue to expand our mega hubs. As we said, we have 44 open today. We have targeted 75-plus mega hubs in the future. We are well on our way to accomplishing that over the next couple of years. We have got about 200 hubs today. We think on a longer term basis we could almost double that number. So, we are excited about it. The markets do perform well when we introduce those hubs into the marketplace and so we are certainly getting an adequate return and excited about the sales volume is generated from that. And you are right that there are more and more boxes that are available in the marketplace. They just have to be in the right place and that hopefully will be an opportunity for us, as we move forward.\nOperator: Next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So a couple of follow-ups. On the hurricane in August, did hurricane, how much -- to what degree that impacted the 16.5%, and perhaps, as you peel that hurricane back, did -- do it for me actually moderate post-stimulus?\nBill Rhodes: Okay. So the hurricane, this was not a massive hurricane except for the people that were directly impacted. So it was a pretty small area that was hit. Our sales were softer in that last week, not disproportionately softer but they were softer. We did lose a store in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Fortunately, we know no AutoZoners that were significantly impacted, as a result of that hurricane or the one that happen week and a half ago. As far as commercial moderating, they both moderated in the August period of time. That\u2019s what we saw. They just stepped down a little bit. But we were, frankly, tickled to death with 16.5% comps in August.\nChristopher Horvers: Yeah. Really strong. And then, from a regionality perspective, as you saw some of the flare ups of COVID over the summer, did you see any change in your business, any deceleration or acceleration? And as you think about some of the harder hit areas around COVID earlier, the spring, for example, the Northeast, how do that -- those areas perform over the quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Back in the spring, there was a clear delineation between the hardest hit areas and the rest of the country. This summer there was very little differentiation, and certainly, little differentiation that you could attribute to COVID. You would see some weather patterns as we always do. But I would say, that the COVID impact in the summertime was unremarkable.\nChristopher Horvers: And then on the Northeast?\nBill Rhodes: I am sorry?\nBill Giles: Northeast.\nChristopher Horvers: The Northeast, did that as miles driven hasn\u2019t gotten less worse there, has that part of the country seeing a more marked improvement?\nBill Rhodes: It has rebounded back to being more normal with the rest of the markets.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Thanks very much and congratulations to all.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nBill Giles: Thank you, Chris.\nBill Rhodes: Appreciate it, Chris.\nOperator: Next question is from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDavid Lance: Hi. This is David Lance on for Zack. Thanks for taking my questions. So as you continue to take share on the commercial side, I was just curious if you could comment on how this business has changed as a result of the pandemic and whether you would view the double-digit growth is sustainable going forward?\nBill Rhodes: Well, I think, one of the things that happened in the pandemic is everybody that run -- was operating a business, started running down case scenarios, us included, I talked about it on the last call that we were asking ourselves questions that I never thought we would ask ourselves, questions like liquidity. But in the midst of the depths of the pandemic, we did two things, one, we invested in our AutoZoners. Other people were saying, how do I cut my costs like crazy. We said, how do we stand in the gap for the most important thing we have, which is our AutoZoners. We have provided them with that emergency time off benefit. The other thing that we did was we didn\u2019t lay-off or furlough one single person, not one, as a result of the pandemic and we kept our operations as normal as possible. Yes, we cut back our store hours of operation. But that was about it. Other people, particularly the less sophisticated, less well-capitalized people, many of which were on the commercial side of the business, they reacted very swiftly and very strongly and they let people go, they cut back their service level. And so it provided us an opportunity to over serve our customers during that period of time, certainly from a competitive point of view. I think that, that has a longstanding impact, whether or not we can grow commercial 10% into the foreseeable future, that\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. What I know is we are winning in the marketplace. If you look at our growth over -- most of the periods over the last 10 years, our growth versus the competitive landscape has been significantly better, 2 times or 3 times, many times what the industry growth rate is and we feel really good about where we are.\nDavid Lance: Great. And then just one more from us, how do you think miles driven plays out when you think through the moving parts around extended work-from-home, but also the higher demand from used cars in a population shift to the suburbs?\nBill Giles: It feels as though the miles driven is getting better each month, I mean, obviously, it was down maybe close to 10% back in July. But if you look at the current fuel sales, it would imply that miles driven is down in the mid- to low-single digits at this point. So our expectation is that that\u2019s a number that\u2019s going to continue to improve. And back to Bill\u2019s point earlier, that relative to our customer, it\u2019s very likely that their miles driven is not necessarily negative. They are more likely than not essential workers needing to be able to get to work and able to operate their cars. So our expectation is it will continue to get better and that it is, probably, already a little bit better for our customer.\nBill Rhodes: Can I jump in on that as well, and I just want to remind everybody to go back to the \u201808, \u201809 period of time and when miles driven dipped during that period of time, the correlation between miles driven and our sales performance was -- and the industry sales performance was broken. And we attribute that to the fact that there were a lot of people -- our trends were more aligned with what was going on with employment. And so in these tough economic times, I think, the correlation between miles driven breaks. It comes back together in more normal times. But it definitely is not a good contributor in short-term recessionary environments.\nDavid Lance: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Baker: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on SG&A, it was up, we think about 6% per foot when you adjust for the extra week. What I am trying to understand is, so sales are probably going to slow, which means that maybe the SG&A growth would slow, but then again that SG&A growth maybe was understated because you didn\u2019t have the labor you needed earlier in the quarter. So how do we think about that going forward, for instance, if you continue to comp in the low- to mid-teen level, does that SG&A per foot go up in the next quarter?\nBill Giles: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Michael. And as you know, our game plan is, is that we are going to play in the environment that we are in. So if sales are continued to be strong, we are going to continue to invest back into that. As Bill mentioned before, we probably ended the quarter in reasonably good shape from the standpoint of labor and service, but certainly, at the beginning of the quarter, we were trying to catch up a little bit. So, on an overall basis I would expect us to continue to invest in labor as our sales continue to be strong and we are going to find other opportunities for us to be able to make investments when our business is really strong. Because, again, it\u2019s all about the future and it\u2019s all about our long-term growth and ensuring that we are creating a great service environment for our customers both on the retail side and the commercial side.\nMichael Baker: Okay. So that makes sense. So just to follow-up on that, presumably if we were to be able to look at it on a month-by-month basis or something along those lines, the SG&A per foot in August towards the end of the quarter was up more than 6% and that\u2019s maybe the trajectory we should think about going forward as long as we assume that sales are going to remain pretty strong. Is that fair?\nBill Giles: I would just say on a relative basis, it would have increased as the quarter progressed, yes.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Understood. Thanks. Appreciate that.\nBill Giles: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. \nDaniel Imbro: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning guys. I add my congrats to Bill Giles and Jamere welcome to the team.\nBill Giles: Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thank you.\nDaniel Imbro: Starting on gross margins, Bill, I think, something you guys have talked about in the last 12 months has been a focus on direct sourcing and kind of growing that initiative. Can you update us on where that stands? And then your recent hire of Seong Ohm, obviously, experienced in the global sourcing department, can you talk about how she adds to that capability going forward?\nBill Giles: Yeah. Great question. In fact, we spent a lot of time in energy building, our foreign sourcing office -- buying office over in China and so we continue to find opportunities in a lot of different categories for us to be able to find areas where we can reduce our acquisition costs. One of the other things that pandemic taught us was that, we also want to ensure that we are not too dependent on any particular geographic area of the world and so the team is going to be continuing to find other opportunities throughout the world in order for us to be able to source product. So that will actually, I think, reduce our risk on a long-term basis and should also find other opportunities for us to lower our acquisition cost. Seong will come to us with a significant amount of experience in this area and we are excited about her joining the organization and helping the great team that we have already built overseas buying product every day, but Seong will be able to add a lot of value in that area as well.\nDaniel Imbro: That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color. And then Bill Rhodes, a follow-up on maybe a higher level industry question. I mean you just discussed some of the differences why you are gaining so much share, and obviously, it sounds like it\u2019s coming from the independent operators. As we think through the long-term impacts of that, how long can the independents keep losing share before we start to see maybe a more rapid pace of independent store closures or how do you think that longer term, what are the impacts of that as you keep gaining the share from that base? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Well, that\u2019s a terrific question. I have been in this industry for over 25 years and I have seen the consolidation happen and AutoZone was a significant participant of it in the late \u201890s all the way through 2008 or so. On the commercial side, this consolidation is much more challenging. On the retail side of the business, everybody was looking for geographic expansion and we could all take reasonably the same size boxes and over time turn them into our standard prototypes. On the wholesale side, it\u2019s not as easy. We don\u2019t need the wholesaler\u2019s inventory. We don\u2019t need their distribution. We don\u2019t need their locations. We need their customers and is there more efficient ways for us to get their customers by winning in the marketplace is what we have learned over time. We did great team step our toe into the water with our acquisition of IMC and that didn\u2019t work out very well for us. We believe our strategy and approach to -- approach in the market will win over time. If you look at what we have done in some of our close-in competitors, we have all substantially changed our inventory assortments over the last five years to 10 years. We have all built really strong sales forces and we are continuing to chip away at some of the competitive differentiation that was in the marketplace. I think that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with share over time. These companies, many of the independents, they are not working for a return on the capital though. They are working for their salaries and so what happens them over time, I think, they have longer staying power than other enterprises would. So I think it will take time but I do think that there\u2019s a lot of pressure on independent operators in this commercial side of the business today and that\u2019s not going to let up.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck.\nBill Rhodes: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Rhodes.\nBill Rhodes: Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is very strong and our business model is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2021. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest in our great company. Stay safe and be well.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Giles",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about both our domestic and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores increased 14.2%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1.914 million. This compares to an average of $1.847 million at Q4 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased on a 16-week basis 16.8% to $976 million, an amazing number this quarter reached several records for us. In the quarter sales through our DIFM customers represented 21.5% of our total sales, an increase approximately $89 million from last year's Q4. Last year did have the extra week and excluding that week, our sales were up $140.4 million, our weekly sales program were $12,250 and they were up 14.2% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As we open fewer program this year at 114 finishing with 5007 total programs, our sales efficacy per store has never been higher. Not only was $12,250 a week record for us, but we were able to average $60 million in total weekly commercial sales, an amazing accomplishment. While we know many of the industry participants remain comfortably ahead of us currently, we know we are on the right path. This past year, we again believe our sales increases were materially better than the overall industry and will remain focused on repeating this in FY'21. I should take a moment to discuss four major things that are making a real difference for us when it comes to commercial. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiative. One major example of this is adding to the number of mega hub locations. These stores have been opened five this quarter and now numbering 44 in total substantially increased local market availability. Mega hubs lift our sales noticeably in the markets where they open. With over 80,000 SKUs or more available same day and even multiple times per day from these mega hub markets, we are able to say, yes, materially more than when compared to carrying 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs from a hub. Second, we are improving our service. We are delivering faster and we are supporting our customers with their overall needs better than before. We recently began rolling out new technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, we have got our stores managers to buy in to our commercial sales initiatives. They are not only involved with the commercial effort but they are fully onboard with driving sales calls and improving our service to our commercial customers. They now own the commercial business in their store. And fourth, we continue to rollout initiatives that make us much easier to do business with. We now have our commercial program in 5,007 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic this past quarter. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 21.91 to the dollar and was roughly 15% higher than last year's fourth quarter. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were down for the quarter versus last year. During the quarter we opened 11 new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts are short-term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 43 stores. We opened five new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced immense challenges with COVID-19 and stay-at-home mandates. In fact, many of our stores in Brazil were focused or forced to be closed for weeks like our stores in Puerto Rico. In both markets, our AutoZoners were very creative and quickly implemented drive-through no contact service. You should have seen the lines of cars. Currently, we view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.1% of sales, down 31 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. This past quarter's gross margin included approximately $4 million and charges related to damage from civil unrest. The increase in gross -- the decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower merchandise margins driven primarily by a shift in mix. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 30.7% of sales, leveraging 338 basis points to last year's fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. Our SG&A grew 9.2% over last year's fourth quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred a net $10.7 million in charges related to our offering emergency time-off and additional direct COVID expenses. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick-up, we would expect the spend rate to increase, and as previously mentioned, at times, we haven't been able to adequately staff to the increase in volume, as our staffing levels have increased so will our labor cost. EBIT for the quarter was $1.18 million. Our EBIT margin was 22.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 14% from Q4 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and a $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the third quarter. We are planning interest at $48 million for the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 versus $43.7 million in last year's quarter. Our higher forecast than last year is driven, again by the costs associated with the new bond issuance and 1 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.513 billion or $307 million above last year's Q4 ending balance of $5.206 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9 times EBITDA. Our lower-than-normal credit metric reflects the temporary suspension of share repurchase program. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. In the long -- in long-term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.3% versus 21.5% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 35 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 107 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the first quarter of FY'21, we suggest investors to model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to report a stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $740 million, up was 41.2% versus last year's fourth quarter when excluding the 17th week. Our diluted share count of 23.9 million was lower by 4.3% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $30.93, up 47.6% over the prior year's fourth quarter excluding the extra week. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.417 billion of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $600 million over last year's Q4 with an extra week. Net fixed assets were up 2.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $183.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 65 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,885 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 43 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,549. Depreciation totaled $125.4 million for the quarter versus last year's expense of $118.5 million. This is generally in line is generally in line with recent growth rates. We did not repurchase any AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $692 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 1.9 times. As Bill mentioned earlier, we had suspended our share repurchase program, as we continue to evaluate cash flow generation and the economy as a whole. At this stage, based on current conditions and the strength of our business, we expect to be utilizing our free cash flow generated each quarter in order to opportunistically start buying back -- our program back up. It remains and will remain a core tool to our model, as we believe it is a terrific flexible way to return excess cash flow after appropriately investing in our business to our shareholders. Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company's inventory increased 3.6% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $683,000 versus $674,000 last year and $685,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandized inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $104,000 versus a negative $85,000 last year and a negative $56,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 115.3% versus last year's Q4 of 112.6%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 38.1%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Thank you, Michael. Yeah. It's a good question, Michael. I would start by first saying, most of the gross margin impact was product mix shift. So we had some categories like lighting and brakes that typically have higher margins than our average and those underperformed the quarter. Batteries as an example, outperformed during the quarter and they typically have slightly lower margins than the average. So that's what drove it a little bit. But, yes, we did provide -- we did find opportunities for us to lower select categories like commodities, where we are really not adding a lot of service and it's an opportunity for us to be more competitive. And we did gain market share in many of those categories during the quarter. So we think it was the right decision and long-term it will help drive sales and ultimately help drive gross profit. But to dimensionalize it was probably a single-digit basis point impact. Thank you. On the growth side, I would just say that, look we grew gross profit dollars by 20%. Our focus is again on driving gross profit dollars. And so where we can find opportunities to invest back in the business, we are going to do that, and over time, retail and commercial prices will go up and down based on market conditions. So, again, our standpoint is, look, our margin is in a really healthy place right now and we have got great opportunities for us to lower cost through lower acquisition opportunities and so we have -- on a category-by-category basis, we feel really good about where our margin is. There's always going to be some shift in product sales mix that's going to impact the margin. Thank you, Simeon. Great question, Seth. Yeah. We think that there's continued opportunity. As we mentioned before, we are going to continue to expand our mega hubs. As we said, we have 44 open today. We have targeted 75-plus mega hubs in the future. We are well on our way to accomplishing that over the next couple of years. We have got about 200 hubs today. We think on a longer term basis we could almost double that number. So, we are excited about it. The markets do perform well when we introduce those hubs into the marketplace and so we are certainly getting an adequate return and excited about the sales volume is generated from that. And you are right that there are more and more boxes that are available in the marketplace. They just have to be in the right place and that hopefully will be an opportunity for us, as we move forward. Northeast. Thank you, Chris. It feels as though the miles driven is getting better each month, I mean, obviously, it was down maybe close to 10% back in July. But if you look at the current fuel sales, it would imply that miles driven is down in the mid- to low-single digits at this point. So our expectation is that that's a number that's going to continue to improve. And back to Bill's point earlier, that relative to our customer, it's very likely that their miles driven is not necessarily negative. They are more likely than not essential workers needing to be able to get to work and able to operate their cars. So our expectation is it will continue to get better and that it is, probably, already a little bit better for our customer. Yeah. It's a good question, Michael. And as you know, our game plan is, is that we are going to play in the environment that we are in. So if sales are continued to be strong, we are going to continue to invest back into that. As Bill mentioned before, we probably ended the quarter in reasonably good shape from the standpoint of labor and service, but certainly, at the beginning of the quarter, we were trying to catch up a little bit. So, on an overall basis I would expect us to continue to invest in labor as our sales continue to be strong and we are going to find other opportunities for us to be able to make investments when our business is really strong. Because, again, it's all about the future and it's all about our long-term growth and ensuring that we are creating a great service environment for our customers both on the retail side and the commercial side. I would just say on a relative basis, it would have increased as the quarter progressed, yes. Thank you, Michael. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. In fact, we spent a lot of time in energy building, our foreign sourcing office -- buying office over in China and so we continue to find opportunities in a lot of different categories for us to be able to find areas where we can reduce our acquisition costs. One of the other things that pandemic taught us was that, we also want to ensure that we are not too dependent on any particular geographic area of the world and so the team is going to be continuing to find other opportunities throughout the world in order for us to be able to source product. So that will actually, I think, reduce our risk on a long-term basis and should also find other opportunities for us to lower our acquisition cost. Seong will come to us with a significant amount of experience in this area and we are excited about her joining the organization and helping the great team that we have already built overseas buying product every day, but Seong will be able to add a lot of value in that area as well."

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2020 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax; and Jamere Jackson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer-Elect. Jamere who joined us just last week will be observing only today, but we are so glad to have him here and part of our great team. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with our slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late May, much of the world's attention has been on COVID-19, its current and short-term implications and trying to evaluate the long-term ramifications of this pandemic. During Q3's conference call, we shared the incredible volatility we experienced during the third quarter, with three very distinct performance periods. Pre-COVID, where our same-store sales were up about 6% or so, and then the midst of the stay-at-home orders where our comps were down over 20% and then the last four weeks where our performance was in the low-teens following the stimulus checks and at the beginning of the enhanced unemployment benefits. We shared last quarter that our retail sales increased an incredible 50% one week from a Monday to a Wednesday. This quarter's sales story was very different. It was quite consistent and consistently, very, very strong. While last quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced, this quarter marked another milestone. AutoZone enjoyed its largest quarterly same-store sales performance since going public in 1991, 22% -- 22% same-store sales growth, and that introduced new unfamiliar challenges. With the significant increase in customer traffic in our retail and commercial sales, we had to intensely focus on ensuring the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, and that took a tremendous amount of creativity on the part of our team. Our supply chain, specifically our distribution centers, our vendor partners and their operations were and continue to be under immense pressure to keep up with the surge in demand we have experienced over the last five months. Our in-stock positions today aren't up to our usual high standards and we are working diligently to get recover, but our supply chain wasn't built for 25% excess capacity. I have mentioned often that our sales are pretty predictable staying in a very tight band. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth since stimulus money began to flow. That said, our sales in both retail and commercial were high, but very consistent from the beginning of our quarter in early May through July. We were anxious to see what happened to our sales performance in August, after the enhanced unemployment benefits subsided. We are very happy to report that our domestic same-store sales in August, while down some from May through July were still up a remarkable 16.5%. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as they are always are, but all of our regions performed well. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the first quarter and fiscal \u201821. It remains very difficult for us to predict. Based on our performance post-enhanced unemployment, we feel our sales will remain elevated for some time, and typically, in recessionary environments, we performed well, but nothing, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There is simply too many remaining unknowns, will the federal government's 300 hours enhanced unemployment benefit be sufficient? How long will it last? Will there be an effective vaccine, and if so, when? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which once have changed permanently? And many, many more questions. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long-term to-date, we don't see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks, the strongest periods we have experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811, all coming out of recessionary periods. This is why we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized sales growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retain many of those customers in the years that follow. We always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team continues to do has really been exceptional. I applaud our entire organization each and every AutoZoners across the enterprise from Hawaii to South Paulo from ALLDATA to our DataZone facility in Mexico. Every AutoZoners has had to learn new ways to work, new ways to meet and exceed the wants, needs and desires of our customers, and everyone has met, embraced and delivered on that challenge. I couldn't be more proud of the phenomenal team I have the honor of working alongside. I especially want to call out and on behalf of every AutoZoner, recognize our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been thrown many, many curveballs in the last six months and they have met every challenge with tremendous ingenuity, courage, innovation and passion. Most importantly, they have continued to deliver an exceptional service experience for our customers. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every single day. Now let's move into our performance for the quarter. Same-store sales were up 21.8% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $740 million and our EPS was $30.93 a share, 36.9% above last year. Excluding the extra week in last year's fourth quarter, our EPS was up an amazing 47.6%. Regarding our sales performance, while the consistency from week-to-week was predictable, the volume of business was the outlier this quarter. Our sales were much higher than we could have forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year and they sustained higher levels than we would have predicted on our last call in May. While our retail business was stronger than our commercial business, both businesses had week-to-week consistent sales performance. Our DIY same-store sales were up approximately 24%. Our share growth in retail over the last four months on the detailed information we have available for our broadest set of competitors shows that we have been gaining much, much more share than at any time before in both units and dollars. Our commercial business total sales were up approximately 17% on a 16-week basis. In commercial, we averaged over $60 million in weekly sales, which was over $12,200 in sales per program per week, both new records for us. Candidly, we are most proud to highlight that we continue to live up to our stated values when it came to taking care of our AutoZoners. During our third quarter, we announced that all eligible hourly, full and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time-off benefits and it would be available immediately. Remember back to that time, at that time, we didn't wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by government. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the frontlines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time-off, including for the first time in our history, providing eligible part-timers with paid time-off up to 40 hours. This additional time-off can be used as the AutoZoner desires, and if they don't use it between now and the calendar year-end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren't comfortable coming to work. Others had childcare issues. Others were simply anxious. While the vast majority were comfortable continuing to come to work and providing great service to our customers in their time of need. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values. In the fourth quarter, we extended these emergency time-off benefits to our store managers and distribution center advisors, each of whom have been on the frontline, supporting and leading their teams through this extraordinary season. We were honored to be able to make these investments in our AutoZoners in recognition of what they have done and continue to do for our customers and our organization. Overall, this quarter sales were a record for us, but it is simply impossible and would be irresponsible to extrapolate these results going forward. With so many variables heading into the fall, we continue to manage the business literally from week-to-week and our field organization continues to do an outstanding job managing the business. As we said on last quarter's call, we expect that our sales growth will moderate over time. But we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. One thing that we are sure about, our team has shown their resiliency and they remain nimble. They are ready to react quickly to every single change. We remain focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge, and our AutoZoners have definitely and continue to put our customers first. While geographic differences weren't a significant story this quarter, there continued to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories specifically in the retail business. We continue to see some surprisingly strong categories that I will call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. We believe that with people having more time on their hands and many having more discretionary money due to the enhanced unemployment benefits, often making more than they were making before or a lack of spending on entertainment-type categories, customers are working on their quote, project car or doing that enhancement job they have been constantly putting off. At the same time, we noted that certain product lines grew at a slower rate compared to the chain average. Merchandise categories like brakes, rotors or even motor oil, while up from pre-COVID levels aren't growing at the same rate as the overall store. We believe these categories maybe impacted by the decrease in miles driven and in the brake categories, specifically, the lack of severe winter weather last year. Now let's turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 33 basis points. Included in our cost of goods this quarter was a shift of mix and 9 basis points of headwind due to civil unrest expenses. In addition, we have also identified select categories that are more commodity based, which are less dependent upon service that we have lowered prices in order to be more effectively compete with our non-traditional competitors to increase volumes. On operating expenses, our team particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses during these times well. As our sales accelerated drastically in a very short period of time, we didn't have the available labor to achieve our desired staffing labels until later in the quarter. So we wish we could have spent more on labor to provide an even better customer experience. Our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 excluding the extra week due to our very strong sales results, we were able to leverage operating expenses 315 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $11 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses. While the last two quarters expenses related to COVID have been significant, as we visit stores and distribution centers and talk to our team, this decision strengthen our already unique and powerful culture, and show that this organization walks the talk. We believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was up a bit and our cash and cash equivalents were up dramatically. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.6 billion is excess cash. Increasing our debt levels, adding a new 364-day line of credit and increasing excess cash were purposeful, as we wanted to maximize our liquidity position due to the significant uncertainty. We also felt we managed our inventory well as our inventory per store growth increased 1.3% versus Q4 last year. We feel our strong liquidity position heading into the fall months allows us immense flexibility when it comes to thoughtfully reinstituting our share repurchase program. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program in March. It was certainly the right decision. At the time, as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world, our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be so. We expect to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We intend to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we did in March, if we have concerns about the near-term, we can and will temporarily suspend repurchases again, which is one of the significant benefits of a share repurchase program versus a dividend approach of returning capital to shareholders. We expect to maintain an elevated level of cash and cash equivalents throughout most of this new fiscal year. In regard to our CapEx spend during the quarter. We spent less this year than last year. We paused our development on many stores during the depths of the stay-at-home orders, which slowed our ability to complete construction and open new stores. As a result, we finished this year with 113 new U.S. stores versus 154 last year and we opened only 25 stores across all of Mexico and Brazil for the year. For 2021, we would expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic new stores and roughly 50 international stores. I will spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID's effect on consumer's ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter we continued to see very strong growth in our online shopping channels, buy online, pickup in store, next-day delivery and ship to home. In particular, our buy online pickup in-store offering grew rapidly at 4 times the growth rate of the ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that our online sales still represent a very, very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. While online purchasing is a smaller business for us, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pickup. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough and I am confident that I speak on behalf of our shareholders too, and say, thank you. AutoZoners, you truly delivered on AutoZone's promise to provide exceptional customer service. Now I will turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill? Thank you, Bill. These continue to be unique and unprecedented times and they have required us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We don't know what lies ahead of us for this new fiscal year, but we feel we are much more prepared today for uncertainty than we were at the start of this pandemic. We will be ready for a wide variety of economic environments and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families, drive to a close vacation spot or get back into the school year. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for our upcoming first quarter and the new fiscal year. But as I stated before, that isn't practical for us with all the unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. Our domestic retail business was a tremendous surprise for us this past quarter. We understand trends will ultimately slow. While we appreciate these things, we feel we are well-positioned for continued future share gain opportunities in both the domestic, retail and commercial segments. We had an outstanding quarter, but we have work to do as we start a new fiscal year. Frankly, our focus isn't on what happens this new quarter. Its, are we keeping our AutoZoners and customer safe today, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now and I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on our company. Before we proceed to questions, we made some exciting organization announcements a few weeks ago. We announced that Bill Giles and Bill Hackney, two tremendous long-term talented leaders plan to retire at the end of the calendar year. It is impossible to state the tremendous impact each of them have had on our business, our culture and our teams. They will be sorely missed. But in their typical fashion, they always put the company's interest ahead of their own and they have been sharing with us for a long time that this day would inevitably come. As such, their teams are prepared and we simultaneously announced the addition of two new fabulous leaders to our team. Our new EVP, CFO, Jamere Jackson is with us today and Seong Ohm will be joining us soon as our new Senior Vice President of Merchandising. We are so excited to add these two seasoned highly accomplished leaders to our team. It will be terrific to inject their ideas, thoughts, and perspectives into our future strategies and tactics. We welcome Jamere and Seong, and we look forward to celebrating the enormous contributions of Bill and Bill. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Yeah. I think that is one of those other questions that are really hard to say right now, Michael. And I will go back to, on our last call, if you would have told me that our sales would continue for four months -- additional four months at those elevated levels, I wouldn't have thought that to be true, but they did. And the biggest news to me was the fact that August still had 16.5% same-store sales growth post-economic stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits. What happens with miles driven will be an element of it. But a lot of the miles that are being driven, they are not all the same. Our customer -- our core customer, their habits haven't changed. They are still going to work every day. When you think about the miles driven it's -- that have declined, it's generally higher socioeconomic groups that are working from home. Our core customers, they haven't worked at home, just like our store AutoZoners and D.C. AutoZoners. They haven't worked at home a day. So I don't think all miles driven are the same. What happens in the next 12 months? Frankly, it's very, very difficult for us to predict. The piece that I hang on to and we hang on to is, generally when economic times are tough people prioritize their vehicle at a different level because they are not going to get a new vehicle in any short-term period, and therefore, they change their maintenance and upgrade their vehicles. So, as I said earlier, the last -- over the last three decades, the best periods of performance for us have all been coming out of recessionary environments. Will this recessionary environment be the same as those other periods? I don't know. But that's the best analogy that we have at this point. Yeah. Okay. So you know this, our long history is, we report earnings so quickly after the end of our quarter. Usually three quarters of the year within two and a half weeks at the end of the year because of year [and] [ph] we go three and a half weeks. I just don't want to talk about trends in September, because I just don't want people focusing that much attention on such a short period of time. That's why we were so crystal clear about what happened in August, that we did see a 16.5% comp in August. So I want to leave it at that, Simeon. I understand your desire to hear more but I don't want us extrapolating two weeks or three weeks. Okay. Let me answer your first follow-up question on the CARES Act and then, Bill, will take the gross margin one. As far as the CARES Act, if there was a CARES, I think, it's now 4 and we provided additional enhanced unemployment benefits. I think you see more of the benefit on the DIY side of the business, because that's where the most financially fragile customers are. If you look back to what happens every year when tax refunds come out and it's the DIY business, they both pick up, but the DIY business picks up even more. So I think it would be beneficial on both sides, more beneficial on the DIY side. Bill? Thanks, Simeon. Yeah. Some terrific questions in there. As far as the last question of, did we pull projects forward? I think the project work is kind of, I call it, the never doing now category. These are projects that people thought that they would do some time, but they never had the time to do them, and therefore, when they had the time and they had some incremental disposable income they tackled those jumps. I do -- our battery business, as Bill said, has been very, very strong. A lot of the reasons we believe it's been strong is because a lot of people park their vehicle for some extended period of time. Once they restarted it the battery had been discharged some. So are those some failures that might have happened this coming winter when it got cold? That's the only piece that I wonder if that might have a bit of a pull-forward. But we will see when we get into next year. What was the first part of your question? Yeah. DIY started, I mentioned it, went up 50% in two days back in April and so it ramped really quickly. The commercial business lagged it, but it continued to build very methodically over the course of the quarter. As we got into August, both businesses took a little bit of a step down when that enhanced unemployment benefit went away. Okay. So the hurricane, this was not a massive hurricane except for the people that were directly impacted. So it was a pretty small area that was hit. Our sales were softer in that last week, not disproportionately softer but they were softer. We did lose a store in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Fortunately, we know no AutoZoners that were significantly impacted, as a result of that hurricane or the one that happen week and a half ago. As far as commercial moderating, they both moderated in the August period of time. That's what we saw. They just stepped down a little bit. But we were, frankly, tickled to death with 16.5% comps in August. Back in the spring, there was a clear delineation between the hardest hit areas and the rest of the country. This summer there was very little differentiation, and certainly, little differentiation that you could attribute to COVID. You would see some weather patterns as we always do. But I would say, that the COVID impact in the summertime was unremarkable. I am sorry? It has rebounded back to being more normal with the rest of the markets. Thank you. Appreciate it, Chris. Well, I think, one of the things that happened in the pandemic is everybody that run -- was operating a business, started running down case scenarios, us included, I talked about it on the last call that we were asking ourselves questions that I never thought we would ask ourselves, questions like liquidity. But in the midst of the depths of the pandemic, we did two things, one, we invested in our AutoZoners. Other people were saying, how do I cut my costs like crazy. We said, how do we stand in the gap for the most important thing we have, which is our AutoZoners. We have provided them with that emergency time off benefit. The other thing that we did was we didn't lay-off or furlough one single person, not one, as a result of the pandemic and we kept our operations as normal as possible. Yes, we cut back our store hours of operation. But that was about it. Other people, particularly the less sophisticated, less well-capitalized people, many of which were on the commercial side of the business, they reacted very swiftly and very strongly and they let people go, they cut back their service level. And so it provided us an opportunity to over serve our customers during that period of time, certainly from a competitive point of view. I think that, that has a longstanding impact, whether or not we can grow commercial 10% into the foreseeable future, that's anybody's guess. What I know is we are winning in the marketplace. If you look at our growth over -- most of the periods over the last 10 years, our growth versus the competitive landscape has been significantly better, 2 times or 3 times, many times what the industry growth rate is and we feel really good about where we are. Can I jump in on that as well, and I just want to remind everybody to go back to the \u201808, \u201809 period of time and when miles driven dipped during that period of time, the correlation between miles driven and our sales performance was -- and the industry sales performance was broken. And we attribute that to the fact that there were a lot of people -- our trends were more aligned with what was going on with employment. And so in these tough economic times, I think, the correlation between miles driven breaks. It comes back together in more normal times. But it definitely is not a good contributor in short-term recessionary environments. Well, that's a terrific question. I have been in this industry for over 25 years and I have seen the consolidation happen and AutoZone was a significant participant of it in the late \u201890s all the way through 2008 or so. On the commercial side, this consolidation is much more challenging. On the retail side of the business, everybody was looking for geographic expansion and we could all take reasonably the same size boxes and over time turn them into our standard prototypes. On the wholesale side, it's not as easy. We don't need the wholesaler's inventory. We don't need their distribution. We don't need their locations. We need their customers and is there more efficient ways for us to get their customers by winning in the marketplace is what we have learned over time. We did great team step our toe into the water with our acquisition of IMC and that didn't work out very well for us. We believe our strategy and approach to -- approach in the market will win over time. If you look at what we have done in some of our close-in competitors, we have all substantially changed our inventory assortments over the last five years to 10 years. We have all built really strong sales forces and we are continuing to chip away at some of the competitive differentiation that was in the marketplace. I think that that's what's happening with share over time. These companies, many of the independents, they are not working for a return on the capital though. They are working for their salaries and so what happens them over time, I think, they have longer staying power than other enterprises would. So I think it will take time but I do think that there's a lot of pressure on independent operators in this commercial side of the business today and that's not going to let up. You bet. Thank you. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is very strong and our business model is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2021. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest in our great company. Stay safe and be well."

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release, the world has changed significantly, and so has our business. During our last call, on March 3rd, we were focused on COVID-19, but more from a supply chain disruption perspective. Quickly thereafter, the unprecedented ramifications of the pandemic and its disruption on lives across the globe became a reality. As we have navigated these remarkable times, our first priority has been and will continue to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. This quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced. In light of that, this will be a different, more detailed update on our business. Our business is typically pretty predictable. As I\u2019ve said many times, our sales fluctuate in a very tight band, but currently that has not been true. We aren\u2019t sure what lies ahead, so we\u2019re going to share a lower level of granularity this quarter, so you have a deeper understanding of the fluctuations and drivers or potential drivers. I know, as we move into the Q&A, you want us to help you \u201cmodel\u201d our sales performance for Q4. Frankly, we are having a very difficult time forecasting our business week-to-week much less for the next quarter. And who knows what is in front of us this summer. Will the cases decline and subside? Will they escalate as we begin to reopen the economy? Will the government provide additional stimulus? Will enhanced unemployment benefits help our business? Will all of our commercial customer survive? We have too many unknowns. And our focus is on making sure in the short-term. We provide our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long term, to date, we don\u2019t see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular as it has in the last three recessions. As a reminder, our strongest periods of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Well, we always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team has done as an essential retailer and remaining open throughout the crisis to serve the motoring public has been nothing short of phenomenal. I applaud our entire team, many who have had to quickly pivot to new ways of working, but I especially want to call out, recognize and show deep appreciation for our store AutoZoners and our distribution center AutoZoners. These remarkable people have done a tremendous job throughout this time and have made several large changes in how we operate and have done it quickly with tremendous passion and of course with excellence. I simply can't thank them enough for what they have done for our customers and our company. Now let's move into our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were down 1% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $343 million. And our EPS was $14.39 a share 10% below last year. Regarding our sales performance, the quarter can best be described in three time periods, each basically four weeks long. Recall that we had a very mild winter and a disappointing sales performance in our fiscal second quarter. We shared that we were optimistic about the balance of the year and in particular the third quarter as we felt there was pent-up demand. And unlike other mild winters, many of the maintenance categories had not been pulled forward and tax refunds were beginning on time and at normal levels. The first four weeks, our sales as expected were quite strong with same store sales up over 6%. Both Retail and Commercial are performing quite well with Commercial sales growth returning comfortably to double digits. And then for the second four weeks the world changed radically, literally overnight. Our sales performance immediately declined materially dropping to a one week low of comps down more than 25%. We began asking ourselves questions we never fathomed before. Do we have the liquidity necessary to weather this storm? Will we have issues with our debt covenants? Will we need to furlough AutoZoners or reduce compensation? How quickly and significantly can we stop capital expenditures and expenses? We immediately acted to shore up any liquidity concerns. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. Then we issued $1.25 billion of bonds on Wednesday, March 30. We also closed on an additional 364-day $750 million line of credit. This additional line of credit was on top of the un-utilized $2 billion line of credit already in place. We were running very pessimistic scenarios and preparing for what we thought could be the worst. Our team did a tremendous job enhancing our financial position in a chaotic environment in very short order, a testament to the team and also to the strong financial position and long-term performance of the company. Simultaneously, I\u2019m extremely proud to say that we acted swiftly in support of all of our field AutoZoners. Immediately we instituted reduced store hours of operation across the U.S. store base. This allowed our stores to enhance our cleaning protocols and allowed our AutoZoners time off in the evening to de-compress after a very stressful day. As an essential business, we were determined to be ready to safely service our customers, the motoring public each day. This meant taking care of our AutoZoners as well. Very early in the crisis, we announced that all eligible hourly [indiscernible] and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time off benefits and would be available immediately. We didn\u2019t wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by governments. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the front lines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time off, including for the first time in our history, providing part-timers with paid time off up to 40 hours. This additional time off can be used as the AutoZoner desires. And if they don\u2019t use it between now and the calendar year end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren\u2019t comfortable coming to work, others had childcare issues, others were just anxious, while the vast majority were comfortable coming to work and providing great service to our customers. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values and I was honored that our team and our Board of Directors lived up to the powerful culture we often espouse during this crisis. And you know a crisis is when real leaders lead. This alone was an incremental expense in the third quarter of $65 million. And combined with other directly related COVID-19 expenses, our SG&A was negatively impacted by about $75 million in the quarter. In addition to this past quarter\u2019s investments in our AutoZoners, we plan to provide certain other AutoZoners that were not eligible for the first emergency time off benefit with similar benefits during the fourth quarter. We are honored to recognize those AutoZoners, helping our customers every day on the front lines and to say thank you for their efforts. Based on what we know today, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in additional COVID-19 related expenses in the fourth quarter, including this recognition. Our business, retail in particular was beginning to rebound at the end of the second four weeks. Then, at the beginning of the third four week period, federal stimulus checks began to arrive and flow through the U.S. economy. We experienced a significant change in trend, moving from negative double-digit comps to a significantly positive comps almost immediately. To put this in perspective, in two days from a Monday to a Wednesday, our retail sales increased by roughly 50% \u2013 five zero percent in two days. And we continue to experience extremely robust sales performance through the end of the quarter. Throughout this crisis, our DIY business has been substantially stronger than DIFM. Retail began rebounding sooner and reacted stronger than commercial when the stimulus money arrived. At the end of the quarter, our commercial business turned positive again, but had not yet returned to double-digit growth like before the crisis. Specifically for the quarter, our overall same-store sales for each of the four weeks periods were up over 6%, then down more than 20%, then up in the low teens ending the quarter down 1%. Given the extreme volatility in the quarter as I just outlined and as I said in the opening, it is impossible to know what our future sales trends will be. Unfortunately, we\u2019re forced to manage the business literally from week to week and our field organization has done an outstanding job measuring or managing these extremes. We expect that our sales growth will moderate as the stimulus money works its way through the economy, but at the same time, the nation is reopened. What will that do to our business? We simply aren\u2019t sure. What we are sure about is, our team has been incredibly nimble. They have reacted quickly to every single change. We are no longer assuming there are no other significant shocks to the system asking ourselves some of those very difficult questions. Instead, we are focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge and our AutoZoners have definitely been and continue to put our customers first. Regarding geographies, our performance was much worse than some of the most affected areas, specifically the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and also some of our stores in Puerto Rico and Brazil were down considerably as we were forced to close and/or operate under extreme restrictions. Certain markets rebounded pretty quickly like the Pacific Northwest while others like New York, as you would expect, has been slower to recover. Our best performing areas have generally been in the middle of the country. There have been very interesting trends in some of our merchandise categories, specifically in the retail business. Certain categories have been quite challenged like wipers and lighting as people have stayed home more and have not been as active at night or during periods of inclement weather. Other categories have been strong, particularly post stimulus. After a very mild winter, our battery sales have been strong, especially as people parked their cars for extended periods after which the batteries fail or are discharged. We\u2019ve also seen some surprisingly strong categories that I\u2019ll call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. People have more time on their hands, so they\u2019re working on their project car doing that enhancement job. They\u2019ve been constantly putting off before. Now before moving beyond our sales trends, there\u2019s been some significant dialogue regarding short-term impact of miles driven on our business. We have touted miles driven as a key macro factor that impacts our industry\u2019s performance for decades. However, there have been times when the correlation with miles driven in our industry sales performance do not have a strong correlation, like during the Great Recession. We believe that during select generally shorter periods of time, other factors like new car sales, unemployment and the like are more important and miles driven is less important. Now let\u2019s turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter our gross margin was up 2 basis points, along with past storylines around tariffs, supply chain and mix between DIY and DIFM sales, we\u2019ve been a very steady performer in regard to gross margin. On operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, did a remarkable job of managing our expenses during the massive volatility I noted earlier. Imagine trying to manage payroll in line with sales when you have a 50% change in sales in two days, yes, on the surface we had material deleverage, but the majority of that deleverage was associated with our decision to provide enhanced benefits for our hourly AutoZoners in the form of emergency time-off, costing us approximately $65 million in the quarter. While a very significant and expensive decision, as I\u2019ve visited stores and talked to our team, this decision strengthened our already unique and powerful culture and showed that this organization walks the walk. I believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Additionally, we had other directly related COVID expenses of approximately $10 million. Excluding these unique charges, our overall operating expenses were below the prior year\u2019s quarter. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt came down a bit and our cash was up, both were purposeful as we were mindful of cash conservations. We also felt we managed our inventory well, as our inventory per store growth declined 0.5% versus Q3 last year. We feel we have strong liquidity heading into our summer season and can handle many of the future unknowns. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program. It was certainly the right decision at the time as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world. Our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be. We haven\u2019t restarted repurchases yet. But as we gain better visibility to our business trajectory, we intend to continue to leverage our free cash flow after robust investments in our business to reduce share counts. Our current thinking is to continue to operate at reasonably similar credit metrics to the past, while excluding the extraordinary unique COVID-19 expenses we discussed above. On last quarter\u2019s conference call, we discussed impacts from the supply chain and goods we received from China in particular. Today, we are in good shape and have no significant disruptions to report. While we created contingency plans for each merchandise category sourced from China, we ultimately did not have to implement them. Unfortunately, the COVID story shifted to become more of a U.S. centric story and away from the supply chain disruptions. That said that portion of this pandemic and the tariffs have made us think differently about supplier diversity. We need to also consider country diversity as well going forward. There will be certain of our plans that are disrupted as a result of the crisis, some known today while others will emerge over time. For instance, we paused our store development activities for about a month as we try to get a better understanding on where this was headed. We did this in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. We\u2019ve subsequently restarted development work in the municipalities that allow us to do so. As a result, we will not meet our new store opening goals for the year. We are pushing in an orderly fashion to get back to opening new stores as quickly as possible. But in this environment, arbitrary goals and dates are not terribly important. So look for us to open less than 200 stores globally this fiscal year. I\u2019ll spend a quick moment on our omni-channel efforts as COVID-19 effects on customers\u2019 ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customers shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. We initiated a curbside pickup option in an amazingly short period of time. Additionally, we saw very strong growth in our online shopping channels Buy Online Pick-Up In Store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home. In particular, our Buy Online Pick-Up In Store offering grew rapidly at over double the growth rate of our ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that omni-channel for AutoZone still represents a very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough nor can the rest of the management team, and I\u2019m confident that I can speak on behalf of our shareholders too and say thank you AutoZoners, you truly are essential and you are exceptional. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles.\nBill Giles: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 0.3%. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,856,000. Now, this compares to an average of $1,814,000 at Q3 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased 6.7 \u2013 decreased 6.7%. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 21% of our total sales and decreased approximately $40 million from last year\u2019s Q3. Our weekly sales per program were $9,700 and they were down 9% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, our DIFM business was materially impacted from the COVID impact, more so than our DIY sales. While certainly one of our most challenged sales performances in many quarters, we would ask listeners to see through this quarter and ask us if we believe we are in good shape for future market share increases and the answer to that question is yes. We feel there may be a real opportunity for us to grow our business in the future. With so many smaller, single proprietary shops still operating across America and having to be closed for an extended period of time creates unforeseen challenges for these shops. We continue to believe we can gain market share into the future. We now have our commercial program in 4,950 stores or 85% of domestic stores. While we did not roll out as many programs this past quarter, it was due to our inability to market to customers. We felt it appropriate to maintain distancing from customer shops, while this past quarter is certainly unique, we remain encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Much like the impact COVID had on sales in the U.S., our stores in Mexico were also impacted. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on the business. At the start of the quarter, the exchange was below MXN 20 to $1, but weakened throughout finishing 26% weaker at MXN 24 to $1. During the quarter, we opened two new stores and finished with 610 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts, much like with the U.S. are short term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 38 stores. We opened no new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced the same challenges with COVID sickness and stay-at-home mandates. Much like Mexico, we view the COVID impact short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.6% of sales, up 2 basis points versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 35.9% of sales, deleveraging 201 basis points to last year\u2019s third quarter. Our SG&A grew 5.8% over last year\u2019s third quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred approximately $65 million in charges related to offer an Emergency Time-Off to eligible full and part-time AutoZoners, and another $10 million in additional direct COVID expenses. Excluding these extraordinary charges, operating expenses were below last year. As we have demonstrated over time, our organization is very good at adapting to the environment we are operating in. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. EBIT for the quarter was $491,700,000. Our EBIT margin was 17.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.5 million, up 9.7% from Q3 a year ago and higher than our plan. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility both completed this past quarter. We are planning interest at $68 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $61.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven again by the cost associated with the new bond issuance and the 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.418 billion or $266 million above last year\u2019s Q3 ending balance of $5.152 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.8% versus 19.5% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 26 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 259 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.7% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the fourth quarter was $343 million, down 15.5% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of $23.8 million was lower by 6.2% from last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.39, down 10% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third quarter, we generated $651 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 1.4% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,836 stores in the U.S., 610 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,484. Depreciation totaled $91.7 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter expense of $84.9 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $166 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $466 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And again, our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as we continue to study future cash flow generation. Over time, however, we continue to view our share repurchase program as an integral to our capital allocation strategy remains and will remain a core tool to our earnings per share model. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 2.7% over the same period last year, driven by the new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $685,000 versus $688,000 last year and $713,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was a negative $56,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $41,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.2% versus last year\u2019s Q3 of 108.7%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 34%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Bill. These certainly are unique and unprecedented times and they require a very different cadence of data gathering, evaluation and decision-making. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While making so many significant decisions so quickly, we know we won\u2019t get them all right. And that\u2019s okay, but as long as we are making the best decisions with the right motivations and adjusting as we go, we will continue to persevere. We don\u2019t know what lies ahead of us for the next few months or even the next couple of years. But what I know is we have a very resilient business that has performed exceptionally well in a wide variety of economic environments, and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their family, drive to a close vacation spot or other personal priorities. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for the fourth quarter. But as I stated before, there are too many unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear, our expectations do not include sales remaining as robust as we experienced in the last few weeks of the third quarter. Our expectation is the stimulus money will work its way through the economy rather quickly. Our best guide is annual tax refunds and typically those funds positively impact our business for about three weeks. Frankly, our focus isn\u2019t on what happens this quarter. It\u2019s are we keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe today while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during this very difficult time to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now? And I continue to be quite bullish on our industry and in particular on our company. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: The phone lines are now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and a nice job managing through the environment. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the commercial trends that you observed over that last four week period. It sounds like you got back to positive. Just wondering, would you categorize it as sort of a gradual improvement over that four week period tied in with miles driven improving? I mean, I guess how are you thinking about that? And if you could give us a sense on maybe how positive it got over that time period that would be helpful.\nBill Rhodes: Sure. It was very interesting on the commercial business. It took a pretty deep dive. It\u2019s down roughly 30% and it stayed there for three or four weeks. Then it began to rebound. If you look at those last four weeks, it was negative the first two, and then it turned positive the second two, ending it caught in mid-single digits positive. It was also interesting \u2013 I can't say whether or not it was tied to miles driven. It certainly began rebounding as the \u2013 as the retail business took off when we got the stimulus money in the economy. But also a lot of customers \u2013 we saw a significant amount of customers that just stopped purchasing from us altogether for some period of time, our assumption and we tried to reach many of them, is they closed at the beginning of this. And as we got towards the latter part of the quarter, we saw that those non-purchasing customers had decreased substantially, if not completely. So it looks like some of them just closed their shops and went and did whatever they needed to do, stayed at home and then began reopening and our business picked up.\nSeth Sigman: Okay, that's helpful. And then, past the external factors, if you just think about how AutoZone is managing the commercial business with all the disruption and the volatility through the period, do you feel like the strategy has been set back in any way? Are there any limitations to sort of getting back that commercial momentum, that double-digit growth that we've seen in prior periods?\nBill Rhodes: I don't think that our strategy has impacted one bit by what's happened in retail or commercial in any significant way at this point in time. Now, we're going to have to understand and watch what happens with consumer behavior. I don't think anybody really knows as the economies and the cities start reopening, who knows what consumer behavior is going to look like. So far what we're seeing is it looked a whole \u2013 looks a whole lot like it did before the pandemic, but I'm sure consumers are going to adjust parts of their behavior and we\u2019ll have to adapt accordingly to that. But on the commercial side of the business, the only thing that's still holding us back is, is we're not doing a lot of face to face sales calls yet. We'll be doing that probably before long, but we're not out there being able to tell our story like we were before.\nSeth Sigman: Understood. Okay, thanks. Best of luck.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So I know you\u2019ve been resistant to give us too much help with modeling the current quarter, but in light of your comments around the stimulus dollars potentially lasting around three weeks or so, should we take that to assume that your current quarter to date trends are meaningfully slower than what you experienced in that last four weeks of the third quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Man, you're baiting me, Michael.\nMichael Lasser: Yes, I am sure I am.\nBill Rhodes: And I completely understand, okay. We have a long history of not talking about what's going on intra-quarter because we release our earnings within two and a half weeks of our quarter end. So I just don't want to be giving two and a half week information and people trying to extrapolate that. I wouldn't make the interpretation that our business has gone way down since that point in time, but that's really all I want to say.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And on your comment around the business development piece of the commercial growth, should \u2013 and that may be coming back more slowly than just the underlying growth. Should we assume that more than half of the call it double digit call it 10% growth that the commercial business has been growing over the last several quarters has been coming from new customer additions as a result, we can factor that piece to be lower to come back and that's how we should frame the outlook for the commercial program \u2013 for commercial segment from here?\nBill Rhodes: I don't think it would be coming all from new customers. You have to believe that we're building our business with our existing customers, too. And as Seth mentioned in the previous one about our initiatives on commercial, we feel really good about the initiatives that we have in place, and a lot of it has to do with being easier to do business with our commercial customers, getting more inventory closer to our commercial customers, improving the time in which we can deliver that product. And that will continue on, and that's going to benefit both new customers and existing customers. So our ability to be able to grow with our existing customers remains very strong.\nBill Giles: Yes, let me just add on to that, too. I mean one of the bigger changes that we saw as our business started growing significantly almost two years ago now, one of the biggest KPIs that improved for us was mature customer growth in mature programs, which said to us that we're becoming more and more important to our most important customers.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck. \nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey guys good morning. First, just a two-parter on what we were seeing in the prior quarter. Any in states or geographies that were less impacted by COVID or more rural, did you experience a similar roller coaster? And then if you look at the product mix that you were selling, and Bill Rhodes, you gave some color on this, are there any products that where you would either \u2013 if I'm washing or waxing my car, I'm pulling forward margin or sales that we may not see that as strong in future periods?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, terrific questions. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the middle part of the country, Simeon, whether it was urban, suburban or rural, all had the same roller coaster. Maybe not \u2013 didn't go down quite as far but certainly went down significantly. They just rebounded faster, and they've increased more during this period of time. As far as the product categories, yes, there's been a lot of changes, some really interesting trends in the product categories. For instance, right now, we're seeing more work in paint and body than we've seen in a long time. And it's across the board. It's Bondo. It's sandpaper. It's paint. People just have time on their hands and they are doing some of those projects that they haven't done before. Excellent question about does that mean we're pulling some businesses forward or that we're going to have a headwind or a tailwind because of gross margin, I don't think any of that is true. I think we're probably pulling some work that was never going to happen before, and it's happening now.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thanks for that. And then my follow-up, I know you mentioned it\u2019s really hard to predict the environment. I don't know if there is a working hypothesis at AutoZone regarding miles driven, unless it's just taking week-to-week and month-to-month, but if there is, if you can share it. And then any different posture from the business as far as looking to acquire share vis-\u00e0-vis smaller businesses, which I know you haven't done a lot of that in the past, but I wonder if that \u2013 if this is some change that we can expect.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. You want to take the latter part of that?\nBill Giles : Yes. I think that from a share perspective, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing in terms of organically growing and taking market share. We believe that there's significant opportunity. Now given the current environment, I suspect that some players in the industry will continue to be challenged. And so that may create opportunities or not, but we're going to continue to stick with our strategy, and a lot of that is organic growth.\nBill Rhodes: On the first part of your question, Simeon, on miles driven, we were very intentional in our prepared remarks to talk about miles driven. I think AutoZone was actually the one that came out with that notion 25 years ago or so that there was an important factor underlying the trajectory of the industry. And we\u2019ve held to that and believed that however, and we learned during the Great Recession that during certain periods of time, it is not correlated very well at all with the industry same-store sales. We saw that in 2009, 2010 and 2011. That there are just other factors and our thought is when people have a high degree of unemployment, people aren\u2019t buying new cars and the like that miles driven aren\u2019t as important as they were.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Mike Baker from Nomura. Your line is now open.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks guys. So a couple of longer-term questions. I know, you said you\u2019re not really at this point changing your strategy, which makes sense. But longer-term, do you think there\u2019s going to be any change to consumer behavior with respect to DIY versus DIFM with some \u2013 a lot of jobs now, people getting used to working from home and if not going to the office, maybe not every day, but certainly working from home a couple days a week. Does that dictate longer-term that the whole industry might move more towards DIY in a way from commercial, which I think would be a reverse of trends that we saw pre-COVID?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Terrific questions. Many of which we\u2019re thinking through and we certainly don\u2019t have definitive conclusions at this point in time. I think on the shift between DIY and DIFM, there\u2019s been a long pattern of both sectors of the industry growing pretty well. DIY has been \u2013 our DIFM has been growing slightly faster than DIY, but DIY has continued to grow almost every single year. A lot of people are starting to talk about work-from-home. I think that they\u2019re also not thinking about who our customer is, for the most in particular, on the DIY side of the business. Our customers\u2019 generally are financially fragile customer. They\u2019re not going to have the opportunity to work-from-home. They\u2019re working blue collar jobs in a lot of cases. And so their shift in work, even during the crisis wasn\u2019t to go work at home, they had to be out doing their jobs. As we\u2019ve seen, we rolled out curbside pickup, which was really great. Our team did it in a remarkably short period of time. And we\u2019ve seen all of our digital sales grow through Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, which includes curbside. We\u2019ve seen our next day delivery grow and we\u2019ve seen our ship to home grow. The biggest growth that we\u2019ve seen is in our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store. And as I\u2019ve been out in stores, I\u2019ve yet to see a customer do a curbside order. And as I talked to AutoZoners, I ask them, are you getting a lot of curbside orders? And they say, no. Once the customers realize that we\u2019re open, in fact, they\u2019ll come to the door and say, can we come inside? Then they want to come in and interact with our most important asset, which is our AutoZoners. So as people start returning to this new normal, it seems like their behaviors are pretty consistent with the way they were in the past. Now our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store is basically double what it was pre crisis right now. But that\u2019s still a very, very small percentage of our business.\nMike Baker: Understood. Thanks. And if I could follow-up on that \u2013 again, in terms of the long-term. You mentioned a couple of times potential for commercial customers that were either closed or they might end up needing to close permanently. I guess the question is, have you seen any of that yet? Or is that just what you think could happen or potentially might happen? Or again, are you starting to see just commercial customers, smaller ones just go out of business and is that an opportunity for share gains? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, we absolutely saw commercial customers close on a temporary basis. Probably, as indicated by we had zero purchases from them for weeks, call it 5% to 10% of our commercial customers. It's very interesting as the stimulus money came in, as the commercial business began to pick up. One of the interesting things we've seen is, we were worried about our commercial receivables. Well, we're seeing that our commercial customers are in fact catching up on the receivables that they got behind on in the crisis. So I don't see any big wave of commercial customers that are closing. I'm sure that they are on the margin, certain commercial customers that were nearing retirement or we're teetering on the edge of not being solvent and they're going to go away. But I don't think that that business is going to go away. The customer might \u2013 that particular shop might go away, but then the work is just going to move to another shop. So I don't see any significant shifts yet at this point in time.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color.\nBill Rhodes: Absolutely. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew McClintock from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nMatthew McClintock: Yes. Good morning, everyone. And it's great to hear your voices, I hope to hope god everyone sounds good. The one question I have is just, you talked about supplier diversity, you talked about country diversity, and I just wanted you to dig a little bit more into those comments and maybe just discuss the overall fragility of your supplier base and how your way of thinking towards the supply chain is \u2013 not supply chain, but your suppliers is changing. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Sure. For a long time, we've been working on making sure that we have diversity in particular categories, vendor diversity. And as \u2013 it's actually again thinking about this long before the crisis hit, but the crisis made it even more acute at this point in time. But as you think about what's happened with China with the tariffs over the last year or so, it's significantly increased our cost structure at a moment\u2019s notice and what having all of certain categories, even if we had two or three or four vendors, all of those vendors would were in China take rotors and steel products, for example. All of those are coming out of China, when that happens and you get slapped with a 10% or 25% tariff, your costs went up 10% or 25% overnight. So we need to be thinking as we always have about vendor diversity, we also need to think about country diversity and this situation COVID-19 only made that, that much more important.\nMatthew McClintock: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Horvers: Thank you, and good morning. So I wanted to ask about the early part of the quarter, actually, up more than 6%. Now granted, you probably got some of the worst part of the winter behind you given the timing of your quarter, but it does seem like you've outperformed peers in that first four weeks. So you talked about the strength of the commercial business based on the data that you see, where you outperforming, did you gain share DIY and did it have anything to do with perhaps, weather or delayed tax refunds a year ago?\nBill Giles: Yes, I think overall, I mean, like we gain market share during that time period and overall for sure. And so we feel pretty good about that. I think also we were in the heart of the tax season and so we were able to execute very well on that. There was also \u2013 to be fair, there was probably a little bit of the 53rd week shift in that time period as well that benefited us, but it was a strong period for us.  We had mentioned at the end of Q2 that we felt pretty good about starting Q3 and all the things that we thought we had in place, et cetera, from a supply chain perspective, from inventory initiatives. And so we were strong on both fronts and so we were pretty well positioned as we headed into Q3 and it showed up in our first four weeks of our numbers.\nChris Horvers: And then what was the shift? The past couple of quarters that\u2019s hurt you, so what was the shift benefit in this quarter?\nBill Giles: It was probably less than a 100 basis points for sure, probably closer to 40 to 50 during that time period.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then my follow-up on gross margin, so you did had negative comp, but you didn't deleverage, it seems like in the supply chain was there some benefits that came in, in terms of the DIY mix, that was an offset and just typically you do give some commentary about how you think about gross margin on a go-forward basis? Do you still see the sourcing benefits coming through and should we expect some modest positive there?\nBill Giles: Yes, I think that we'll continue to see some modest positive it\u2019s a very good way to say Chris, in terms of our ability to be able to continue to expand our supply, our sourcing capabilities. When you think about the gross margin overall for this quarter, couple of interesting parts is that, one is that the commercial business was actually at a decrease. So although that typically is a headwind for us, it was not so much of a headwind in this quarter. Now at the same time, from a retail perspective, although we were very strong in the retail side of the business, couple of categories that Bill mentioned before are lighting, wipers that typically have higher margin were less sold as people were certainly driving less at night. So those two categories probably were a little bit of a headwind, so that kind of mixed out. And we wound up having kind of a flattish gross margin, so frankly we feel really good about the health of our gross margin, right and would continue to expect it to be strong and slightly positive as we move forward.\nChris Horvers: Understood, best of luck. Thanks guys.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Congrats on managing a tough environment really well.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you. \nBrian Nagel: So the question I had a number of \u2013 a number of retailers now have called out the benefits of the stimulus payments from their sales trajectory as you did, is there \u2013 as you look at the data, is there a way to separate out? What benefit you may have gotten from consumers actually putting to work those stimulus checks versus just an overall underlying improvement of consumer confidence as that was taking place in the economy?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, that's a fantastic question. I can't do it with data. I can tell you when your business changes 50% in two days, that there's a pretty strong correlation that consumer behavior changes take more time than that.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. That's helpful. The second question I had also, I apologize for getting too much into the weeds here we've watched your commercial business grow so nicely over the past few years. So we talked a lot about AutoZone really moving up that call list with your individual mechanic customers. Clearly there's disruptions here with all this going on and you called that, I guess Bill Giles called it out in his prepared comments, but have you seen any indications that one reason or another, that AutoZone has fallen down in individual mechanics?\nBill Rhodes: Absolutely not, I think if anything, we're moving up that list. There are certain players in the commercial side of the industry that don't have the financial strength that we have. We've been there throughout the entire crisis, taking care of our customers and getting better and better every day. So I think if anything, we moved up that list and the crisis and I don't hear a lot of people talking about their commercial business being positive like we said, ours was for the last two weeks of the quarter.\nBrian Nagel: Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys\nBill Rhodes: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: When you think about the diversifying your supply chain geographically, I guess how long a process is that? And I guess is there a capacity or adequate capacity in other manufacturing markets that could really sort of fill the hole that China would leave? And would that still be on the back of private label? Or do you have to start buying branded parts to get into other manufacturing markets?\nBill Rhodes: I think it would definitely be on private label side more so than branded parts for sure. With this, what we've been doing with the China products anyway. Certainly Bret, it would take a considerable amount of time, but it's one of those things, if you don't ever start it, then you'll never get there. We've already begun some of that work. In fact, right before the crisis, I can remember having a conversation about some of our folks go into Turkey and we're like, are we comfortable with them going to Turkey? But those kinds of markets, Vietnam, South Korea, we've been working those markets for some time, India. And Mexico is bigger than anybody outside of China. So we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships and learn those new suppliers over time.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then a question on the market share consolidation, I mean it does sound as if some of these smaller distributors have been pretty stressed in this recent environment? If you think about potential door closures, how much contraction do you think we could actually get it? There's 36,000 auto parts stores out there. How many do you think we come out of this with?\nBill Rhodes: And that's the age-old question. I mean, I think it's been 34,000 to 36,000 auto parts outlets for 20 years or so. I just \u2013 I don't have a good insight into that Bret. I wish I did, but obviously hard times are going to put more pressure on folks than good times are. I would expect a higher percentage than we've seen over the last five years. But does it go up 10% or does it go up 25%? I don't know.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And if I could whip it a housekeeping question for Bill Giles, I guess on the leverage ratio, do you need to be down at 2.5 to start the buyback or can you start the buyback at 2.6 as you ended the quarter?\nBill Giles: Yes, no, I mean we certainly, we ended the last quarter 2.6. So I think that anywhere in that neighborhood where we would be comfortable. So those are the credit metrics that we've always said.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I think the other part of that too is when we think about our business, we're going to pull out those COVID-related expenses. So if you pull them out, that also changes the leverage metric a little bit.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Rhodes.\nBill Rhodes: Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to pivot and encourage us all to take all the precautions we can take to keep everyone safe and healthy. Yes, we're taking precautions that inconvenience us. But during these times, our personal actions matter. And as we celebrated Memorial Day yesterday, we should remember all the heroes of yesteryear, but also remember today's heroes. They all matter. May God bless America during this challenging time. Thank you for being with us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Giles",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 0.3%. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,856,000. Now, this compares to an average of $1,814,000 at Q3 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased 6.7 \u2013 decreased 6.7%. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 21% of our total sales and decreased approximately $40 million from last year's Q3. Our weekly sales per program were $9,700 and they were down 9% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, our DIFM business was materially impacted from the COVID impact, more so than our DIY sales. While certainly one of our most challenged sales performances in many quarters, we would ask listeners to see through this quarter and ask us if we believe we are in good shape for future market share increases and the answer to that question is yes. We feel there may be a real opportunity for us to grow our business in the future. With so many smaller, single proprietary shops still operating across America and having to be closed for an extended period of time creates unforeseen challenges for these shops. We continue to believe we can gain market share into the future. We now have our commercial program in 4,950 stores or 85% of domestic stores. While we did not roll out as many programs this past quarter, it was due to our inability to market to customers. We felt it appropriate to maintain distancing from customer shops, while this past quarter is certainly unique, we remain encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Much like the impact COVID had on sales in the U.S., our stores in Mexico were also impacted. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on the business. At the start of the quarter, the exchange was below MXN 20 to $1, but weakened throughout finishing 26% weaker at MXN 24 to $1. During the quarter, we opened two new stores and finished with 610 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts, much like with the U.S. are short term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 38 stores. We opened no new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced the same challenges with COVID sickness and stay-at-home mandates. Much like Mexico, we view the COVID impact short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.6% of sales, up 2 basis points versus last year's third quarter. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 35.9% of sales, deleveraging 201 basis points to last year's third quarter. Our SG&A grew 5.8% over last year's third quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred approximately $65 million in charges related to offer an Emergency Time-Off to eligible full and part-time AutoZoners, and another $10 million in additional direct COVID expenses. Excluding these extraordinary charges, operating expenses were below last year. As we have demonstrated over time, our organization is very good at adapting to the environment we are operating in. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. EBIT for the quarter was $491,700,000. Our EBIT margin was 17.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.5 million, up 9.7% from Q3 a year ago and higher than our plan. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility both completed this past quarter. We are planning interest at $68 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $61.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven again by the cost associated with the new bond issuance and the 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.418 billion or $266 million above last year's Q3 ending balance of $5.152 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.8% versus 19.5% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 26 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 259 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.7% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the fourth quarter was $343 million, down 15.5% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of $23.8 million was lower by 6.2% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.39, down 10% over the prior year's third quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third quarter, we generated $651 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 1.4% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,836 stores in the U.S., 610 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,484. Depreciation totaled $91.7 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $84.9 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $166 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $466 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And again, our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as we continue to study future cash flow generation. Over time, however, we continue to view our share repurchase program as an integral to our capital allocation strategy remains and will remain a core tool to our earnings per share model. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company's inventory increased 2.7% over the same period last year, driven by the new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $685,000 versus $688,000 last year and $713,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was a negative $56,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $41,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.2% versus last year's Q3 of 108.7%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 34%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Yes, let me just add on to that, too. I mean one of the bigger changes that we saw as our business started growing significantly almost two years ago now, one of the biggest KPIs that improved for us was mature customer growth in mature programs, which said to us that we're becoming more and more important to our most important customers. Yes. I think that from a share perspective, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing in terms of organically growing and taking market share. We believe that there's significant opportunity. Now given the current environment, I suspect that some players in the industry will continue to be challenged. And so that may create opportunities or not, but we're going to continue to stick with our strategy, and a lot of that is organic growth. Yes, I think overall, I mean, like we gain market share during that time period and overall for sure. And so we feel pretty good about that. I think also we were in the heart of the tax season and so we were able to execute very well on that. There was also \u2013 to be fair, there was probably a little bit of the 53rd week shift in that time period as well that benefited us, but it was a strong period for us.  We had mentioned at the end of Q2 that we felt pretty good about starting Q3 and all the things that we thought we had in place, et cetera, from a supply chain perspective, from inventory initiatives. And so we were strong on both fronts and so we were pretty well positioned as we headed into Q3 and it showed up in our first four weeks of our numbers. It was probably less than a 100 basis points for sure, probably closer to 40 to 50 during that time period. Yes, I think that we'll continue to see some modest positive it's a very good way to say Chris, in terms of our ability to be able to continue to expand our supply, our sourcing capabilities. When you think about the gross margin overall for this quarter, couple of interesting parts is that, one is that the commercial business was actually at a decrease.

And we wound up having kind of a flattish gross margin, so frankly we feel really good about the health of our gross margin, right and would continue to expect it to be strong and slightly positive as we move forward. Yes, no, I mean we certainly, we ended the last quarter 2.6. So I think that anywhere in that neighborhood where we would be comfortable. So those are the credit metrics that we've always said."

            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2020 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release, the world has changed significantly, and so has our business. During our last call, on March 3rd, we were focused on COVID-19, but more from a supply chain disruption perspective. Quickly thereafter, the unprecedented ramifications of the pandemic and its disruption on lives across the globe became a reality. As we have navigated these remarkable times, our first priority has been and will continue to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. This quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced. In light of that, this will be a different, more detailed update on our business. Our business is typically pretty predictable. As I've said many times, our sales fluctuate in a very tight band, but currently that has not been true. We aren't sure what lies ahead, so we're going to share a lower level of granularity this quarter, so you have a deeper understanding of the fluctuations and drivers or potential drivers. I know, as we move into the Q&A, you want us to help you \u201cmodel\u201d our sales performance for Q4. Frankly, we are having a very difficult time forecasting our business week-to-week much less for the next quarter. And who knows what is in front of us this summer. Will the cases decline and subside? Will they escalate as we begin to reopen the economy? Will the government provide additional stimulus? Will enhanced unemployment benefits help our business? Will all of our commercial customer survive? We have too many unknowns. And our focus is on making sure in the short-term. We provide our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long term, to date, we don't see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular as it has in the last three recessions. As a reminder, our strongest periods of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Well, we always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team has done as an essential retailer and remaining open throughout the crisis to serve the motoring public has been nothing short of phenomenal. I applaud our entire team, many who have had to quickly pivot to new ways of working, but I especially want to call out, recognize and show deep appreciation for our store AutoZoners and our distribution center AutoZoners. These remarkable people have done a tremendous job throughout this time and have made several large changes in how we operate and have done it quickly with tremendous passion and of course with excellence. I simply can't thank them enough for what they have done for our customers and our company. Now let's move into our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were down 1% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $343 million. And our EPS was $14.39 a share 10% below last year. Regarding our sales performance, the quarter can best be described in three time periods, each basically four weeks long. Recall that we had a very mild winter and a disappointing sales performance in our fiscal second quarter. We shared that we were optimistic about the balance of the year and in particular the third quarter as we felt there was pent-up demand. And unlike other mild winters, many of the maintenance categories had not been pulled forward and tax refunds were beginning on time and at normal levels. The first four weeks, our sales as expected were quite strong with same store sales up over 6%. Both Retail and Commercial are performing quite well with Commercial sales growth returning comfortably to double digits. And then for the second four weeks the world changed radically, literally overnight. Our sales performance immediately declined materially dropping to a one week low of comps down more than 25%. We began asking ourselves questions we never fathomed before. Do we have the liquidity necessary to weather this storm? Will we have issues with our debt covenants? Will we need to furlough AutoZoners or reduce compensation? How quickly and significantly can we stop capital expenditures and expenses? We immediately acted to shore up any liquidity concerns. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. Then we issued $1.25 billion of bonds on Wednesday, March 30. We also closed on an additional 364-day $750 million line of credit. This additional line of credit was on top of the un-utilized $2 billion line of credit already in place. We were running very pessimistic scenarios and preparing for what we thought could be the worst. Our team did a tremendous job enhancing our financial position in a chaotic environment in very short order, a testament to the team and also to the strong financial position and long-term performance of the company. Simultaneously, I'm extremely proud to say that we acted swiftly in support of all of our field AutoZoners. Immediately we instituted reduced store hours of operation across the U.S. store base. This allowed our stores to enhance our cleaning protocols and allowed our AutoZoners time off in the evening to de-compress after a very stressful day. As an essential business, we were determined to be ready to safely service our customers, the motoring public each day. This meant taking care of our AutoZoners as well. Very early in the crisis, we announced that all eligible hourly [indiscernible] and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time off benefits and would be available immediately. We didn't wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by governments. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the front lines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time off, including for the first time in our history, providing part-timers with paid time off up to 40 hours. This additional time off can be used as the AutoZoner desires. And if they don't use it between now and the calendar year end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren't comfortable coming to work, others had childcare issues, others were just anxious, while the vast majority were comfortable coming to work and providing great service to our customers. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values and I was honored that our team and our Board of Directors lived up to the powerful culture we often espouse during this crisis. And you know a crisis is when real leaders lead. This alone was an incremental expense in the third quarter of $65 million. And combined with other directly related COVID-19 expenses, our SG&A was negatively impacted by about $75 million in the quarter. In addition to this past quarter's investments in our AutoZoners, we plan to provide certain other AutoZoners that were not eligible for the first emergency time off benefit with similar benefits during the fourth quarter. We are honored to recognize those AutoZoners, helping our customers every day on the front lines and to say thank you for their efforts. Based on what we know today, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in additional COVID-19 related expenses in the fourth quarter, including this recognition. Our business, retail in particular was beginning to rebound at the end of the second four weeks. Then, at the beginning of the third four week period, federal stimulus checks began to arrive and flow through the U.S. economy. We experienced a significant change in trend, moving from negative double-digit comps to a significantly positive comps almost immediately. To put this in perspective, in two days from a Monday to a Wednesday, our retail sales increased by roughly 50% \u2013 five zero percent in two days. And we continue to experience extremely robust sales performance through the end of the quarter. Throughout this crisis, our DIY business has been substantially stronger than DIFM. Retail began rebounding sooner and reacted stronger than commercial when the stimulus money arrived. At the end of the quarter, our commercial business turned positive again, but had not yet returned to double-digit growth like before the crisis. Specifically for the quarter, our overall same-store sales for each of the four weeks periods were up over 6%, then down more than 20%, then up in the low teens ending the quarter down 1%. Given the extreme volatility in the quarter as I just outlined and as I said in the opening, it is impossible to know what our future sales trends will be. Unfortunately, we're forced to manage the business literally from week to week and our field organization has done an outstanding job measuring or managing these extremes. We expect that our sales growth will moderate as the stimulus money works its way through the economy, but at the same time, the nation is reopened. What will that do to our business? We simply aren't sure. What we are sure about is, our team has been incredibly nimble. They have reacted quickly to every single change. We are no longer assuming there are no other significant shocks to the system asking ourselves some of those very difficult questions. Instead, we are focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge and our AutoZoners have definitely been and continue to put our customers first. Regarding geographies, our performance was much worse than some of the most affected areas, specifically the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and also some of our stores in Puerto Rico and Brazil were down considerably as we were forced to close and/or operate under extreme restrictions. Certain markets rebounded pretty quickly like the Pacific Northwest while others like New York, as you would expect, has been slower to recover. Our best performing areas have generally been in the middle of the country. There have been very interesting trends in some of our merchandise categories, specifically in the retail business. Certain categories have been quite challenged like wipers and lighting as people have stayed home more and have not been as active at night or during periods of inclement weather. Other categories have been strong, particularly post stimulus. After a very mild winter, our battery sales have been strong, especially as people parked their cars for extended periods after which the batteries fail or are discharged. We've also seen some surprisingly strong categories that I'll call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. People have more time on their hands, so they're working on their project car doing that enhancement job. They've been constantly putting off before. Now before moving beyond our sales trends, there's been some significant dialogue regarding short-term impact of miles driven on our business. We have touted miles driven as a key macro factor that impacts our industry's performance for decades. However, there have been times when the correlation with miles driven in our industry sales performance do not have a strong correlation, like during the Great Recession. We believe that during select generally shorter periods of time, other factors like new car sales, unemployment and the like are more important and miles driven is less important. Now let's turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter our gross margin was up 2 basis points, along with past storylines around tariffs, supply chain and mix between DIY and DIFM sales, we've been a very steady performer in regard to gross margin. On operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, did a remarkable job of managing our expenses during the massive volatility I noted earlier. Imagine trying to manage payroll in line with sales when you have a 50% change in sales in two days, yes, on the surface we had material deleverage, but the majority of that deleverage was associated with our decision to provide enhanced benefits for our hourly AutoZoners in the form of emergency time-off, costing us approximately $65 million in the quarter. While a very significant and expensive decision, as I've visited stores and talked to our team, this decision strengthened our already unique and powerful culture and showed that this organization walks the walk. I believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Additionally, we had other directly related COVID expenses of approximately $10 million. Excluding these unique charges, our overall operating expenses were below the prior year's quarter. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt came down a bit and our cash was up, both were purposeful as we were mindful of cash conservations. We also felt we managed our inventory well, as our inventory per store growth declined 0.5% versus Q3 last year. We feel we have strong liquidity heading into our summer season and can handle many of the future unknowns. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program. It was certainly the right decision at the time as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world. Our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be. We haven't restarted repurchases yet. But as we gain better visibility to our business trajectory, we intend to continue to leverage our free cash flow after robust investments in our business to reduce share counts. Our current thinking is to continue to operate at reasonably similar credit metrics to the past, while excluding the extraordinary unique COVID-19 expenses we discussed above. On last quarter's conference call, we discussed impacts from the supply chain and goods we received from China in particular. Today, we are in good shape and have no significant disruptions to report. While we created contingency plans for each merchandise category sourced from China, we ultimately did not have to implement them. Unfortunately, the COVID story shifted to become more of a U.S. centric story and away from the supply chain disruptions. That said that portion of this pandemic and the tariffs have made us think differently about supplier diversity. We need to also consider country diversity as well going forward. There will be certain of our plans that are disrupted as a result of the crisis, some known today while others will emerge over time. For instance, we paused our store development activities for about a month as we try to get a better understanding on where this was headed. We did this in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. We've subsequently restarted development work in the municipalities that allow us to do so. As a result, we will not meet our new store opening goals for the year. We are pushing in an orderly fashion to get back to opening new stores as quickly as possible. But in this environment, arbitrary goals and dates are not terribly important. So look for us to open less than 200 stores globally this fiscal year. I'll spend a quick moment on our omni-channel efforts as COVID-19 effects on customers' ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customers shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. We initiated a curbside pickup option in an amazingly short period of time. Additionally, we saw very strong growth in our online shopping channels Buy Online Pick-Up In Store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home. In particular, our Buy Online Pick-Up In Store offering grew rapidly at over double the growth rate of our ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that omni-channel for AutoZone still represents a very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough nor can the rest of the management team, and I'm confident that I can speak on behalf of our shareholders too and say thank you AutoZoners, you truly are essential and you are exceptional. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Thank you, Bill. These certainly are unique and unprecedented times and they require a very different cadence of data gathering, evaluation and decision-making. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While making so many significant decisions so quickly, we know we won't get them all right. And that's okay, but as long as we are making the best decisions with the right motivations and adjusting as we go, we will continue to persevere. We don't know what lies ahead of us for the next few months or even the next couple of years. But what I know is we have a very resilient business that has performed exceptionally well in a wide variety of economic environments, and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their family, drive to a close vacation spot or other personal priorities. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for the fourth quarter. But as I stated before, there are too many unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear, our expectations do not include sales remaining as robust as we experienced in the last few weeks of the third quarter. Our expectation is the stimulus money will work its way through the economy rather quickly. Our best guide is annual tax refunds and typically those funds positively impact our business for about three weeks. Frankly, our focus isn't on what happens this quarter. It's are we keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe today while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during this very difficult time to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now? And I continue to be quite bullish on our industry and in particular on our company. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Sure. It was very interesting on the commercial business. It took a pretty deep dive. It's down roughly 30% and it stayed there for three or four weeks. Then it began to rebound. If you look at those last four weeks, it was negative the first two, and then it turned positive the second two, ending it caught in mid-single digits positive. It was also interesting \u2013 I can't say whether or not it was tied to miles driven. It certainly began rebounding as the \u2013 as the retail business took off when we got the stimulus money in the economy. But also a lot of customers \u2013 we saw a significant amount of customers that just stopped purchasing from us altogether for some period of time, our assumption and we tried to reach many of them, is they closed at the beginning of this. And as we got towards the latter part of the quarter, we saw that those non-purchasing customers had decreased substantially, if not completely. So it looks like some of them just closed their shops and went and did whatever they needed to do, stayed at home and then began reopening and our business picked up. I don't think that our strategy has impacted one bit by what's happened in retail or commercial in any significant way at this point in time. Now, we're going to have to understand and watch what happens with consumer behavior. I don't think anybody really knows as the economies and the cities start reopening, who knows what consumer behavior is going to look like. So far what we're seeing is it looked a whole \u2013 looks a whole lot like it did before the pandemic, but I'm sure consumers are going to adjust parts of their behavior and we'll have to adapt accordingly to that. But on the commercial side of the business, the only thing that's still holding us back is, is we're not doing a lot of face to face sales calls yet. We'll be doing that probably before long, but we're not out there being able to tell our story like we were before. Yes. Thank you. Man, you're baiting me, Michael. And I completely understand, okay. We have a long history of not talking about what's going on intra-quarter because we release our earnings within two and a half weeks of our quarter end. So I just don't want to be giving two and a half week information and people trying to extrapolate that. I wouldn't make the interpretation that our business has gone way down since that point in time, but that's really all I want to say. I don't think it would be coming all from new customers. You have to believe that we're building our business with our existing customers, too. And as Seth mentioned in the previous one about our initiatives on commercial, we feel really good about the initiatives that we have in place, and a lot of it has to do with being easier to do business with our commercial customers, getting more inventory closer to our commercial customers, improving the time in which we can deliver that product. And that will continue on, and that's going to benefit both new customers and existing customers. So our ability to be able to grow with our existing customers remains very strong. Yes, thank you. Yes, terrific questions. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the middle part of the country, Simeon, whether it was urban, suburban or rural, all had the same roller coaster. Maybe not \u2013 didn't go down quite as far but certainly went down significantly. They just rebounded faster, and they've increased more during this period of time. As far as the product categories, yes, there's been a lot of changes, some really interesting trends in the product categories. For instance, right now, we're seeing more work in paint and body than we've seen in a long time. And it's across the board. It's Bondo. It's sandpaper. It's paint. People just have time on their hands and they are doing some of those projects that they haven't done before. Excellent question about does that mean we're pulling some businesses forward or that we're going to have a headwind or a tailwind because of gross margin, I don't think any of that is true. I think we're probably pulling some work that was never going to happen before, and it's happening now. Yes. You want to take the latter part of that? On the first part of your question, Simeon, on miles driven, we were very intentional in our prepared remarks to talk about miles driven. I think AutoZone was actually the one that came out with that notion 25 years ago or so that there was an important factor underlying the trajectory of the industry. And we've held to that and believed that however, and we learned during the Great Recession that during certain periods of time, it is not correlated very well at all with the industry same-store sales. We saw that in 2009, 2010 and 2011. That there are just other factors and our thought is when people have a high degree of unemployment, people aren't buying new cars and the like that miles driven aren't as important as they were. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Terrific questions. Many of which we're thinking through and we certainly don't have definitive conclusions at this point in time. I think on the shift between DIY and DIFM, there's been a long pattern of both sectors of the industry growing pretty well. DIY has been \u2013 our DIFM has been growing slightly faster than DIY, but DIY has continued to grow almost every single year. A lot of people are starting to talk about work-from-home. I think that they're also not thinking about who our customer is, for the most in particular, on the DIY side of the business. Our customers' generally are financially fragile customer. They're not going to have the opportunity to work-from-home. They're working blue collar jobs in a lot of cases. And so their shift in work, even during the crisis wasn't to go work at home, they had to be out doing their jobs. As we've seen, we rolled out curbside pickup, which was really great. Our team did it in a remarkably short period of time. And we've seen all of our digital sales grow through Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, which includes curbside. We've seen our next day delivery grow and we've seen our ship to home grow. The biggest growth that we've seen is in our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store. And as I've been out in stores, I've yet to see a customer do a curbside order. And as I talked to AutoZoners, I ask them, are you getting a lot of curbside orders? And they say, no. Once the customers realize that we're open, in fact, they'll come to the door and say, can we come inside? Then they want to come in and interact with our most important asset, which is our AutoZoners. So as people start returning to this new normal, it seems like their behaviors are pretty consistent with the way they were in the past. Now our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store is basically double what it was pre crisis right now. But that's still a very, very small percentage of our business. Yes, we absolutely saw commercial customers close on a temporary basis. Probably, as indicated by we had zero purchases from them for weeks, call it 5% to 10% of our commercial customers. It's very interesting as the stimulus money came in, as the commercial business began to pick up. One of the interesting things we've seen is, we were worried about our commercial receivables. Well, we're seeing that our commercial customers are in fact catching up on the receivables that they got behind on in the crisis. So I don't see any big wave of commercial customers that are closing. I'm sure that they are on the margin, certain commercial customers that were nearing retirement or we're teetering on the edge of not being solvent and they're going to go away. But I don't think that that business is going to go away. The customer might \u2013 that particular shop might go away, but then the work is just going to move to another shop. So I don't see any significant shifts yet at this point in time. Absolutely. Thank you. Sure. For a long time, we've been working on making sure that we have diversity in particular categories, vendor diversity. And as \u2013 it's actually again thinking about this long before the crisis hit, but the crisis made it even more acute at this point in time. But as you think about what's happened with China with the tariffs over the last year or so, it's significantly increased our cost structure at a moment's notice and what having all of certain categories, even if we had two or three or four vendors, all of those vendors would were in China take rotors and steel products, for example. All of those are coming out of China, when that happens and you get slapped with a 10% or 25% tariff, your costs went up 10% or 25% overnight. So we need to be thinking as we always have about vendor diversity, we also need to think about country diversity and this situation COVID-19 only made that, that much more important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, that's a fantastic question. I can't do it with data. I can tell you when your business changes 50% in two days, that there's a pretty strong correlation that consumer behavior changes take more time than that. Absolutely not, I think if anything, we're moving up that list. There are certain players in the commercial side of the industry that don't have the financial strength that we have. We've been there throughout the entire crisis, taking care of our customers and getting better and better every day. So I think if anything, we moved up that list and the crisis and I don't hear a lot of people talking about their commercial business being positive like we said, ours was for the last two weeks of the quarter. Good morning. I think it would definitely be on private label side more so than branded parts for sure. With this, what we've been doing with the China products anyway. Certainly Bret, it would take a considerable amount of time, but it's one of those things, if you don't ever start it, then you'll never get there. We've already begun some of that work. In fact, right before the crisis, I can remember having a conversation about some of our folks go into Turkey and we're like, are we comfortable with them going to Turkey? But those kinds of markets, Vietnam, South Korea, we've been working those markets for some time, India. And Mexico is bigger than anybody outside of China. So we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships and learn those new suppliers over time. And that's the age-old question. I mean, I think it's been 34,000 to 36,000 auto parts outlets for 20 years or so. I just \u2013 I don't have a good insight into that Bret. I wish I did, but obviously hard times are going to put more pressure on folks than good times are. I would expect a higher percentage than we've seen over the last five years. But does it go up 10% or does it go up 25%? I don't know. Yes. I think the other part of that too is when we think about our business, we're going to pull out those COVID-related expenses. So if you pull them out, that also changes the leverage metric a little bit. Thank you. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to pivot and encourage us all to take all the precautions we can take to keep everyone safe and healthy. Yes, we're taking precautions that inconvenience us. But during these times, our personal actions matter. And as we celebrated Memorial Day yesterday, we should remember all the heroes of yesteryear, but also remember today's heroes. They all matter. May God bless America during this challenging time. Thank you for being with us today."

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Starting this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their hard work and dedication to delivering great customer service in light of a challenging sales environment this past quarter. As I mentioned on our last conference call, weather, during our second quarter each year, can be volatile and can significantly impact our performance. Coming off of a strong fall selling season, having delivered 3.4% same-store sales in Q1, we were confident in our ability to execute, but remained cautious heading into our second quarter. And as it has been widely reported, the winter weather was much milder in our second quarter than last year. While our sales were certainly meaningfully below plan and our expectations to deliver both, net income and EPS at the level we were, was commendable. We have an amazingly simple business, yet it has to be executed every day at a very high level across more than 6,400 locations in multiple countries and geographies in order to make everything work. This is where our culture continues to guide and differentiate us. This past quarter, we continued to focus on our many initiatives, not the least of which included incremental inventory replacements, megahub rollouts, ongoing enhancements to how we digitally interact with our commercial customers, and the rollout of our updated retail POS system. We feel both, our store presentation and customer service is second to none in our space. But, I can also tell you with full certainty, we are happy to put this quarter behind us and focus on delivering materially better sales performance for the remainder of the year. In providing a little more color this morning, I\u2019ll talk about the monthly sales cadence, regional sales performance differences, retail versus commercial, and lastly, merchandise categories impacted by the quarter\u2019s results. In regard to cadence for the quarter. As we completed the first two-thirds of our quarter, our same-store sales were positive but certainly below our plan and expectations. As you will recall, in the prior year, the winter weather was also mild until the last two weeks of our quarter, when the polar vortex arrived. As we were comparing against the mild winter with another one, our same-store sales were positive but our two-year growth was considerably softer than it was in our first quarter. At the end of this quarter, as we compared against the severe winter weather last year, our performance compared to last year was very poor with combined same-store sales down 6% for the last two weeks. However, on a two-year comp-store basis, the last four weeks of the quarter were substantially stronger than the first two-thirds of the quarter. Unfortunately, as we have stated many, many times, the timing of our second quarter can result in quite volatile sales performance, both good and bad. And the timing this year couldn\u2019t have been much worse. In the end, weather impacts normalized over time, and our focus is on our long-term performance. Our performance was particularly soft in the Midwestern and Northeastern markets where same-store sales ended 580 basis points lower in these northern markets than in our remaining markets and an even larger 1,700 basis points lower than the remaining markets over the last two weeks of our quarter. Our sales fall off was more pronounced for our DIY business than commercial, but we certainly saw the trajectory of our business slow during this timeframe for both businesses. With over 25% of our sales coming from our Midwestern and Northeastern markets, we could not make up for the sales shortfall from these areas from sales in other markets. Regarding merchandise mix during the quarter. Our cold weather businesses, think batteries, antifreeze and seasonal fluids, were down materially in total across retail and commercial combined. These categories are significant businesses for us, particularly in the winter, and they were our worst performing categories, and combined were down more than 9% on a same-store basis across the country for the quarter, and were both down north of 20% the last two weeks of the quarter. The testament to our team is how resilient our model is during changes in performance during certain periods. With a very challenged sales environment, our team delivered 2% growth in EBIT and grew earnings per share 7.8% for the quarter. This clearly didn\u2019t meet our expectations or aspirations, but was impressive nonetheless. Our financial model allows us to grow cash flow and EPS steadily. I\u2019m very proud of how diligent our organization is in all business climates. During the quarter, our market share, based on the data available to us, was slightly positive through the end of January. While our sales performance for Q2 was comfortably below our plan and expectations, we haven\u2019t seen any material changes in the market or industry drivers beyond weather. We are excited to enter our third quarter where we began to enter our robust selling season, which is starting in earnest right now as federal tax refunds begin to reach our customers. We have had mild winters in the past, but each cycle is different. This year, we expect -- initially you\u2019re seeing a now normalized tax refund season. We believe both our retail and commercial businesses will improve from this quarter\u2019s results. We\u2019re also doing some great things that we feel will benefit sales over time. Our megahub store rollout continued along with key investments in technology. We believe these areas of investment allow us to further differentiate our offerings from our competitors or to close competitive gaps that may exist, allowing us to accelerate further in our industry. We opened two more megahubs this quarter and now have 39 locations. Our megahubs provide deep, very deep, local market coverage for hard-to-find parts. This is critical to both of our sectors but particularly important to our commercial business. And our store and commercial systems have and will continue to receive enhancements this year, making us easier for our customers to do business with, while simultaneously making it more efficient for our AutoZoners. As we enter our all-important sales season, our stores look great and our AutoZoners are doing an excellent job focusing on customer service. We believe we are ready for the remainder of the year. To provide specifics on the quarter, our total sales grew 2.6% this quarter. This compares to last quarter growing at 5.7%. Our DIY sales comps were down versus last year, while DIFM sales were up 8.2% in total. Both of these numbers were negatively affected by the calendar shift, causing a 63 basis-point headwind for the quarter. Regarding our domestic commercial business. We were up against 12.9% growth in the second quarter last year and a harder comparison to last quarter, but we expected we could reach positive double-digit growth. While we did not achieve our targeted double-digit goal for the quarter, we feel our team, across the organization from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers, credit team to ALLDATA, and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. So, with that approach, we will continue to be rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing significantly more than the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at mid-single-digit rate versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continued to produce for us. We averaged $9,400 in weekly commercial sales per program this past quarter, up 5% over last year. We have grown our sales with mature customers and mature programs at substantially improved growth rate the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and ability to enhance the customers\u2019 overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners\u2019 confidence regarding the commercial business continues to increase, and this will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. We believe there remains considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial as our customers are appreciating our new and enhanced offerings. Regarding our domestic DIY business. Regionally, we did better at West with the Northeast and Midwest performing quite poorly versus last year. As we reminded folks on last quarter\u2019s call, the second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalize as does our sales performance. In regard to modeling for the upcoming quarters, we feel there are enough tailwinds within the business that we are planning for sales growth from here for the remainder of the year. We also expect that as our initiatives roll out across the chain for both DIY and DIFM, they will add to improved sales performance. In regard to our technology investments, we have invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Recently, we rolled out our internally developed new POS system to our stores. This new system leverages new architecture and technologies that will expedite retail sales transactions by making the workflow more succinct and logical with touch screen capabilities and allowing us to make future changes much quicker as we replace some very old legacy codes. We\u2019ve also done some important work behind the scenes that should help increase our agility by updating our store operating system and implementing a new human capital management system. We are also investing a great deal in our commercial systems. And as we continue to test these new technologies, we remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter\u2019s call, we highlighted that we were -- what we\u2019re seeing with tariffs. We noted that as a result of tariffs, we expected to have a higher amount of inflation in our cost of goods on a SKU-by-SKU basis than we had in the past. In past years, it was common for us to have deflation at the cost level, but due to tariffs, we began to see cost rise. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs onto our customers through higher retail prices. We were also successful in negotiating with certain vendors to share the costs from tariffs. However, we did have to incur some price increases. As certain tariffs are considerable in particular product lines, we intentionally passed those costs along in higher retails in tranches as we absorbed those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. At this point, we are not planning for any further tariffs on goods imported from China. And in fact, we are trying to get tariffs reduced by applying for relief through the U.S. customs office. To-date, tariffs and their impact on our cost in retails have been manageable. As we begin to lap the tariff cost and commensurate retail increases we implemented last year, we\u2019ve been asked about the impact this will have on same-store sales. While we do not expect to incur the same like-for-like SKU inflation as in the past year, we don\u2019t believe the tariffs were a material net benefit over the last year, nor do we think there will be a significant headwind for the next 12 months. At this point, I\u2019d like to talk about any disruption we may be seeing from the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. While we have not incurred disruption thus far, we must and are being diligent. We have created a contingency plan for each merchandise category sourced from China. Our teams have done a wonderful job planning for potential scenarios. At this point, we have nothing substantial to report. But the longer this outbreak lasts, the more it will impact ourselves, and both our and the overall retail industry. It is currently a very fluid situation as many of the factories have just begun to reopen after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Some are coming back on line quickly, while others quite slowly and certain of them haven\u2019t come back on line yet. The next few weeks will be critical. Turning to our omnichannel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, AutoZonePro mobile app, Duralast parts and ALLDATA. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in ship-to-home, next day delivery, and buy online pick-up in-store sales. But, omnichannel still represents a very small percentage of our business, substantially below 5%. We continue to see buy online and pick-up in-stores as our largest omnichannel business with its mix of omnichannel total sales at over 40% and higher than last year. Our BOPIS model continues to grow faster than our ship-to-home business, highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020, 40 years of wow customer service. We continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers: Exceptional service; fast deliveries; high quality parts and products; trustworthy advice; and flawless execution across the enterprise. We continue to identify and remove all redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our service levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us for the balance of the year. Along with improving local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we provide strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, while we were not pleased with our top line performance, we were pleased with our operating performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM, and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors such as relatively low gas prices and increasing miles driven remain largely in our favor. We remain committed to growing our market share in both, DIY and commercial. Now, let me provide more detail on what we accomplished during the quarter. For the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 25 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand our international footprint, opening two new stores in Mexico and one in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at 35.3%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business, provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It\u2019s important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to deliver great service to our customers and solid financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill?\nBill Giles: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 2.6%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,867,000, which is up from an average of $1,800,000 at Q2 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 8.2% in the quarter. Commercial represented 23% of our total sales and grew approximately $42 million over last year\u2019s Q2. Our average weekly sales per program were $9,400, up 5% on a per program basis versus $9,000 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect our sales per program growth to do better in Q3 than this past quarter as we began our summer selling season. We now have our commercial program in 4,942 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. We remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened two new stores during the second quarter, ending the quarter with 608 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. And regarding Brazil, we now operate 38 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. This market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So, while challenging and currently a drag on earnings, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.3% of sales, up 28 basis points versus last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by supply chain leverage. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth has weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through sourcing. I do want to stress, we remain committed to taking cost out of our business where appropriate. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment and we have been pleased with our growth driven by the acceleration we have experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 38.1% of sales, deleveraging 37 basis points to last year\u2019s second quarter. This was lower than our first quarter\u2019s deleverage of 65 basis points. In fact, our SG&A grew 3.6% over last year\u2019s second quarter. As we lap salary increases initiated in last year\u2019s first quarter and as our sales were challenged, our team aggressively managed costs and we returned to a more historically run rate. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned and ongoing domestic store payroll investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $407.9 million. Our EBIT margin was 16.2%. Interest expense for the quarter was $44.3 million, up 7.2% from Q2 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest at $44.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $43.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven mainly by the associated with the bond issuance we had in April of 2019. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,451 million or $340 million above last year\u2019s Q2 ending balance of $5,111 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.7% versus 17.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 412 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 389 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such, they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $299.2 million, up 1.6% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Our diluted share count of 24.2 million was down 5.8% from last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.39, up 7.8% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Related to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $205 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $89.2 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 28 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,814 stores in the U.S., 608 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,461. Depreciation totaled $90.7 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s second quarter expense of $83.8 million. This is generally in line with our recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $315 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $350 million last year. At quarter end, we had $962 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels. In total, the Company\u2019s inventory increased 7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $713,000 versus $690,000 last year and $694,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $41,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $71,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 105.7% versus last year\u2019s Q2 of 108.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 35.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Bill. Clearly, our sales performance in Q2 was disappointing. We didn\u2019t achieve our plans nor our aspirations. We always know Q2, our shortest, lowest sales season, will be volatile. And this year, due to a very mild winter, our performance suffered and suffered mightily in specific weather-sensitive categories and in particular markets. As we analyze our performance in great detail, we are confident that the key driver this quarter was weather. As we cannot influence the weather and as we know weather impacts normalize over time, our goal is to ensure we understand the drivers of our business and then move on and focus on what we can control. Most of our senior team has been in this business and with this Company for decades. And we have seen this in the past and are focused on delivering optimal performance in the short term in light of the sales environment. But, our real focus isn\u2019t on any single quarters, but building our business for the long term. We all have seen enough cycles to know them when we see them. As we have recited internally, we weren\u2019t brilliant in the first quarter and lost our touch in the second. This too shall pass. With half fiscal 2020 behind us, we believe we continue to be very well positioned to grow sales and earnings for the remainder of the year. Many are now looking at previous mild winters and trying to extrapolate them to the balance of the year, as are we. But, there are always other key factors that impact our industry\u2019s performance, what is the timing of tax refunds, what\u2019s going to happen with summer weather patterns, where are we with the aging of the car park and sweet spots, and on and on and on. In the end, we believe our sales will strengthen from here. And our focus remains on managing this business to the optimum profitability based on the current industry sales environment, which will run through normal marginal cycles from time to time. Our team did just that in the second quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we commit that we will manage this business well, and we will manage it for the long term. Our business model is amazingly consistent. We generate a healthy amount of cash flow each and every year, and this year will be no different. Each year, we target to generate as much or more operating cash flow as the year before. And this year, we have the same target. Let me reiterate, we believe we are in good shape for the back half of the year. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for our customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives, and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners\u2019 workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that given the way of making the customer experience better for both the DIY and the professional customer. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We promise to remain committed to both, executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately, rewards our shareholders. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.\nAtul Maheswari: Good morning. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning.\nAtul Maheswari: I know you\u2019re expecting sales to accelerate over the remainder of the year, but can you provide some color on quarter-to-date trends? How much of sales improved compared to the minus 6% that you witnessed in the final two weeks of the quarter, and what\u2019s really driven the improvement?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, sure. I appreciate the question. We have a longstanding practice. We release our earnings usually within two weeks and a couple of days of the end of the quarter. And we have a longstanding practice to not talk about such a short period of time. As we evidence with the last two weeks of the quarter, our business can be incredibly volatile over short periods of time, and we don\u2019t want anybody to try to extrapolate that good or bad for a 12-week quarter. So, we have longstanding practice to not talk about it. What we do say is, the second quarter is certainly more volatile than the third quarter. As we are entering the third quarter, we anticipate tax refunds coming. As I\u2019m sure most of you have noticed, there was a significant amount of tax refund, $67 billion, that were issued last Wednesday that appears to be generally on track with where we were last year, and we\u2019re excited to enter this very important selling season for us.\nAtul Maheswari: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick one on the calendar shift drag. When should we really expect this drag to reverse and become a benefit? Is that going to be in the third or the fourth quarter of this year?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. It\u2019s - again, one of those things is very hard to tell. As we talked about what happened with the end of the quarter, that could have -- Q2 could have been a net positive or a net negative. In the end, it was a net negative, because of the way that weather hit at the very end of the season. We anticipate we will get what\u2019s happened in the first half of the year back in the second, but it\u2019s going to depend somewhat on what happens around the beginning of the quarter and the ending of the quarters.\nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask you, Bill, first on I guess the timing of bounce back. I know you don\u2019t comment to your last answer. I guess, the question is, do we have to wait for weather or do you -- is that what, we have to wait for weather to normalize or no, it\u2019s not about whether at this point, it\u2019s about tax refunds, and just the timing of the calendar to see the business normalize?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I think, you\u2019re right, Simeon. I think it\u2019s the latter. As we begin to move into the spring season, what dominates our performance is no longer extreme weather patterns. In the winter time, and a lot of people won\u2019t look at what\u2019s happening with average temperatures, which is an indicator. But, what really matters to us in the winter time is when we get extreme cold for an extended period of time, three, four, five days. That puts a lot of pressure on failure parts. The other part that really matters to us is what\u2019s happening with road conditions. If we get a lot of snow and ice and freezing temperatures, that puts the road conditions in pretty bad shape, which puts more pressure on under car and brake systems. One of the things, as we enter this period of time, it\u2019s more about the maintenance categories. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that a lot of times everybody wants to compare to what\u2019s happened in the last three or four mild winters, and that\u2019s absolutely right, and we\u2019re doing the same thing. But there are other things that are happening in the environment. One of the things that\u2019s happened in some of the previous mild winters is we had a significant amount of our maintenance businesses that were pulled forward into Q2. You found not only was it not extreme cold temperatures but you had some very nice weekend weather and people did DIY jobs. We did not see that in Q2. So we are anticipating as these tax refunds flow, as the weather improves that we should have more robust maintenance performance.\nSimeon Gutman: Great. My follow-up is on the commercial strategy. You\u2019ve had great momentum. Can you talk about beginning that the megahub strategy is in and then any incremental inventory investments you plan to make this year?\nBill Rhodes: So, we\u2019ve now opened 39 megahubs. We\u2019ve stated externally that we want to get to 70 to 90. We are very aggressively pursuing those at this point in time, very pleased with the continued performance of our megahubs, and think that they are a key contributor to commercial. They are also a contributor to retail, but very pleased with that progress.\nBill Giles: Yes. And I would say, we\u2019re probably in the fourth or fifth inning, I would say, on the megahubs and we\u2019ll continue to roll out on the hub strategies as well. And to Bill\u2019s point, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance of both, the megahubs and the hubs, but in particular the megahubs both on DIY and on the commercial side of the business. Now, at the same time, that does create a little bit more inventory in the system as we get more inventory out closer to the customer, but we believe long-term that\u2019s the winning strategy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of those points. First just on the commercial side of the business. So, it sounds like the slowdown is really weather related and you\u2019re planning for trends to reaccelerate. Is there anything that you see that would suggest that you can\u2019t get back to double-digit growth in the commercial business in the next quarter or so?\nBill Giles: I would say, no. I think that if we look back over the quarter and see our performance, some of that impacted by weather certainly geographically as we talked about on the DIY business with similar on the commercial side of the business as well. So, some of those more cold weather geographies underperformed considerably during the quarter. So, we believe fairly confidently that we\u2019ll get back to a more normalized double-digit growth rate as we head into Q3. So, fundamentally, we don\u2019t believe that we see anything different in the business.\nBill Rhodes: I think adding a little bit of that too. We also -- and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, our up and down the street business continues to perform very, very well. We did see more challenges with our more national account business as many of which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that as well.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, obviously in the quarter, the margin trends were quite healthy despite the sales shortfall. Your prior commentary had suggested an acceleration in operating profit growth as you move through this year, I guess, getting back to at least low-single-digit EBIT growth. Is that still a fair way to think about it? Anymore parameters around that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBill Giles: Yes. I think, first of all, I think the organization did a great job of managing the way through a difficult quarter, being able to control SG&A leverage, gross margin and be able to drive EBIT growth of around 2%. And I believe last quarter, we said that we would expect to grow EBIT on a positive basis. And yes, we do expect to get to that low-single-digit, mid-single-digit kind of growth rate on a long-term basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBret Jordan: In your prepared remarks, you talked about market share gains. Could you talk maybe DIY versus commercial? And I guess, regionally, did you outperform in any particular market more than other?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, Bret. Great question. I should have clarified that in the prepared remarks. We don\u2019t have good visibility to market share gains and commercial. So, generally, we\u2019re growing commercial at 8% and the market has grown by 4%. We\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re gaining share. My specific comments about growing share slightly are come up from a few different indications that we have on the DIY side of the business.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then, I guess a question on inflation. I think, Bill Giles was talking about or maybe it was you, Bill Rhodes, about not a material net benefit for the year. And I guess, the supplier association and a lot of the peers have been talking about 2% to 3% inflation seen in the last 12 months. Is it just that you haven\u2019t elected to pass through the costs you\u2019ve seen come out of China, or I guess, is there something different about you\u2019re addressing inflation versus theirs?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I can\u2019t speak for theirs. We have certainly seen SKU-over-SKU year-over-year inflation. And the bigger change isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve seen major inflation, it\u2019s generally that we\u2019ve seen deflation. As you think about it, our parts come into the life cycle and they\u2019re very short run until the costs are more expensive. As the part become -- goes through the bell curve and becomes much more -- much higher volumes, our costs go down. And therefore, we have significant deflation as is shown in our LIFO -- major LIFO reserve that we\u2019ve had forever. In the last 18 months or so, we have seen some inflation. We have been very careful about managing that inflation. And as we said in our prepared remarks, if we had a 25% tariff, we didn\u2019t go out and raise our price 25%. We went out and worked that in, in tranches so that we didn\u2019t shock the customer. Over time, we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of rolling those price increases in. We\u2019ve also worked with several of our partners on not pushing the full amount to the customer. There has been some changes in the RMB currency, and we\u2019ve taken advantage of that. So, we\u2019ve been very, I think, judicious about it. We don\u2019t think we saw a big net benefit as costs go up. There is some tampering down of demand. We don\u2019t think we saw a major significant net benefit and therefore we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a major significant net deficit.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. And my first question is just around the calendar shift. I mean, are we seeing two quarters of a negative impact from calendar shift? When do you expect to get that back? Is that more of a third quarter or fiscal fourth quarter event?\nBill Giles: Yes. As Bill said, we\u2019ll have to wait and see to see how the performance is at the end of each of those quarters. Our anticipation is, this is likely more back-end loaded in the second half of the year.\nSeth Basham: Fair enough. And then, secondly, as it relates to your gross margin, did you saw your supply chain leverage as your primary driver of improvement here. Does that include lower costs you\u2019re getting from sourcing or are you specifically talking about savings within your supply chain and distribution?\nBill Giles: That one was pretty much the savings within the supply chain and distribution on a year-over-year basis. We are continuing to try to lower our acquisition costs and believe that overall our margin remains relatively healthy. But for this specific quarter, we were able to leverage down supply chain just by lowering some costs during the quarter.\nSeth Basham: As a follow-up there, as we think about the impacts of tariff-driven inflation into your business over the last year, and what it means for your inventory balances and your gross margins in last quarters, have you been getting a benefit from that, or would you expect a headwind going forward into the back half of the calendar year?\nBill Giles: I think, some of the tariff costs are going to continue to work their way through the average cost of the inventory. And as Bill said, I think, the merchandising organization has done a nice job of being able to feather in the increases to commensurate with the cost increases that we are experiencing. And our expectation is that we will continue to do that. It may be some pressure going forward, but our expectation is that we will be able to manage our way through that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Michael Montani, you are maybe on mute.\nMichael Montani: Hello. Can you hear me?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, we can.\nOperator: Yes, we can.\nMichael Montani: Okay, great. Sorry about that. I just wanted to follow up on the inflation front for a minute, if I could and see what kind of an impact did you see to same-store sales from inflation, in particular for this quarter? And then, on a related note what kind of success have you had at this point in getting rebate checks from tariff-related exemptions?\nBill Giles: Yes. Just to kind of go backwards first, we\u2019re in that process, I think Bill called it out in the prepared remarks that we\u2019ve gone through and made applications for some rebates relative to tariffs and we\u2019ve had some success, but we have more things in the work. So we\u2019ll see how it is. We don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be material, by the way. But we think it will be certainly a help overall. I think on the inflation side of it, as we said, we will probably have inflation of 2-plus-percent on a year-over-year basis from a SKU to SKU basis. But at the same time, it\u2019s very difficult to measure out what the demand impact is as some of the prices have raised a little bit. So, I think that\u2019s where we would say that we haven\u2019t seen a material impact overall from the inflation relative to comp store sales, because it is kind of a blended number with the demand as well.\nMichael Montani: And if I could, just follow-up. One housekeeping thing was the CapEx and D&A outlook for this year -- for the full year. And then secondly, any initiatives that you all may have in the pipeline on the productivity front that could help offset some of those wage increases, whether that be automation in the DCs or potential outsourcing et cetera.\nBill Giles: Yes. From a CapEx perspective, I think our expectation is around $600 million of CapEx for the year and I believe depreciation is around that $350 million number. I would say overall from a CapEx investment perspective, obviously, first and foremost, we\u2019re investing in our stores, we\u2019re investing in the maintenance of our stores, continue to ensure that they look great. We\u2019re investing in hubs and megahubs along the way. We also have a good -- a sizable investment in technology as well. We continue to invest in technology, both to enhance our existing systems as well as to add new functionality in order to improve our customer experience both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business as well. So, those are the major projects that we kind of continue to work on.\nMichael Montani: Okay. Thanks. And just the productivity side?\nBill Rhodes: On the productivity, we\u2019re always working on different productivity initiatives. But, if you\u2019re talking about are we changing the way we go to market in our supply chain by implementing a tremendous amount of new automation or those kind of things, at this point, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re constantly looking at the calculations of where the IRRs make sense. As wage pressure goes up, it changes the economics and we\u2019ll continue to look at it, but we don\u2019t have anything to talk about significantly currently.\nOperator: Our next question is from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nZach Fadem: Hey, guys. First question on coronavirus. You touched on supply chain. Curious, if you have any thoughts on the potential impact to miles driven and how that could impact your business.\nBill Rhodes: It\u2019s a very interesting question. As you would expect, over the last month or so, we have been very-focused on the supply chain aspects of coronavirus. And in the last week or two, more and more focused on what\u2019s happening here in the United States and ultimately, Mexico and Brazil. We see no indications at this point in time of any demand destruction as a result of coronavirus. But just like we said with the supply chain, it\u2019s an incredibly, incredibly fluid situation. I think, the next couple of weeks to a month are going to be critical to see what actually happens. We don\u2019t have good insights into that.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then, just bigger picture on the car park. Curious, if you could speak to where you think we\u2019re at in terms of the sweet spot? How long do you believe the current tailwind can last? And whether it\u2019s more of a benefit to your DIY or your commercial business? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: There\u2019s a lot packed into that question. Yes, we haven\u2019t been big on talking about the ramifications of the car park over the last 12 years. We all know that there was a significant divot in new car sales in 2009. And as those cars came into the \u201csweet spot\u2019, there was a headwind for a while and now it looks like it\u2019s turned into a tailwind. I think it\u2019s on the margin in both instances. What we like to see is steady state new vehicles coming on the road, $16 million, $17 million. The scrappage rate doesn\u2019t appear to change much at all. And therefore, we just have a steady state of new cars. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in the next two or three or four years, that\u2019s going to be radically different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\nOperator: Our next question is from Guru Wright with Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Andrew on for Daniel. I just got a quick question here. I was wondering, your commentary has sounded pretty upbeat on the second half. What gives you this confidence and how could you weight that between Company-specific initiatives and improving demand outlook?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, terrific question. I think what gives us the confidence is that we\u2019ve been here before. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, most of our management team has been here for decades. We\u2019ve seen times of strength; we\u2019ve seen times of softness. We certainly saw softness in the second quarter. As we\u2019re looking at the second half of the year, we have concerns and we also have things that we\u2019re very positive about. On the concern side, I mentioned earlier that the roads, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast haven\u2019t had the kind of difficult conditions that put stress on brake systems and under car systems. That\u2019s likely to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the second half of the year. That said, unlike some other previous winters, we didn\u2019t see this significant pull forward of demand in those exact categories, which are heavily maintenance categories. So, we\u2019re looking at where we are. We absolutely are disappointed with the second quarter, but we don\u2019t see anything that changed as a result of the second quarter other than those road conditions. And therefore, we\u2019ve made zero changes in our plans for the second half of the year. Again, to us, we are disappointed. We hate a bad quarter. But we\u2019re not managing this business for quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019re managing this business for long terms. And that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re going to continue to take and we\u2019re very optimistic that just like we\u2019ve been very successful over the last decades, we\u2019re going to continue to be successful as we look forward.\nOperator: I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for final comments. You may proceed.\nBill Rhodes: Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Giles",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 2.6%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,867,000, which is up from an average of $1,800,000 at Q2 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 8.2% in the quarter. Commercial represented 23% of our total sales and grew approximately $42 million over last year's Q2. Our average weekly sales per program were $9,400, up 5% on a per program basis versus $9,000 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect our sales per program growth to do better in Q3 than this past quarter as we began our summer selling season. We now have our commercial program in 4,942 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. We remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened two new stores during the second quarter, ending the quarter with 608 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. And regarding Brazil, we now operate 38 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. This market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So, while challenging and currently a drag on earnings, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.3% of sales, up 28 basis points versus last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by supply chain leverage. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth has weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through sourcing. I do want to stress, we remain committed to taking cost out of our business where appropriate. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment and we have been pleased with our growth driven by the acceleration we have experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 38.1% of sales, deleveraging 37 basis points to last year's second quarter. This was lower than our first quarter's deleverage of 65 basis points. In fact, our SG&A grew 3.6% over last year's second quarter. As we lap salary increases initiated in last year's first quarter and as our sales were challenged, our team aggressively managed costs and we returned to a more historically run rate. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned and ongoing domestic store payroll investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $407.9 million. Our EBIT margin was 16.2%. Interest expense for the quarter was $44.3 million, up 7.2% from Q2 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest at $44.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $43.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven mainly by the associated with the bond issuance we had in April of 2019. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,451 million or $340 million above last year's Q2 ending balance of $5,111 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.7% versus 17.8% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 412 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 389 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable and as such, they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $299.2 million, up 1.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 24.2 million was down 5.8% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.39, up 7.8% over the prior year's second quarter. Related to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $205 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $89.2 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 28 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,814 stores in the U.S., 608 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,461. Depreciation totaled $90.7 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $83.8 million. This is generally in line with our recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $315 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $350 million last year. At quarter end, we had $962 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels. In total, the Company's inventory increased 7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $713,000 versus $690,000 last year and $694,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $41,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $71,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 105.7% versus last year's Q2 of 108.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 35.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Yes. And I would say, we're probably in the fourth or fifth inning, I would say, on the megahubs and we'll continue to roll out on the hub strategies as well. And to Bill's point, we've been very pleased with the performance of both, the megahubs and the hubs, but in particular the megahubs both on DIY and on the commercial side of the business. Now, at the same time, that does create a little bit more inventory in the system as we get more inventory out closer to the customer, but we believe long-term that's the winning strategy. I would say, no. I think that if we look back over the quarter and see our performance, some of that impacted by weather certainly geographically as we talked about on the DIY business with similar on the commercial side of the business as well. So, some of those more cold weather geographies underperformed considerably during the quarter. So, we believe fairly confidently that we'll get back to a more normalized double-digit growth rate as we head into Q3. So, fundamentally, we don't believe that we see anything different in the business. Yes. I think, first of all, I think the organization did a great job of managing the way through a difficult quarter, being able to control SG&A leverage, gross margin and be able to drive EBIT growth of around 2%. And I believe last quarter, we said that we would expect to grow EBIT on a positive basis. And yes, we do expect to get to that low-single-digit, mid-single-digit kind of growth rate on a long-term basis. Yes. As Bill said, we'll have to wait and see to see how the performance is at the end of each of those quarters. Our anticipation is, this is likely more back-end loaded in the second half of the year. That one was pretty much the savings within the supply chain and distribution on a year-over-year basis. We are continuing to try to lower our acquisition costs and believe that overall our margin remains relatively healthy. But for this specific quarter, we were able to leverage down supply chain just by lowering some costs during the quarter. I think, some of the tariff costs are going to continue to work their way through the average cost of the inventory. And as Bill said, I think, the merchandising organization has done a nice job of being able to feather in the increases to commensurate with the cost increases that we are experiencing. And our expectation is that we will continue to do that. It may be some pressure going forward, but our expectation is that we will be able to manage our way through that. Yes. Just to kind of go backwards first, we're in that process, I think Bill called it out in the prepared remarks that we've gone through and made applications for some rebates relative to tariffs and we've had some success, but we have more things in the work. So we'll see how it is. We don't think it'll be material, by the way. But we think it will be certainly a help overall. I think on the inflation side of it, as we said, we will probably have inflation of 2-plus-percent on a year-over-year basis from a SKU to SKU basis. But at the same time, it's very difficult to measure out what the demand impact is as some of the prices have raised a little bit. So, I think that's where we would say that we haven't seen a material impact overall from the inflation relative to comp store sales, because it is kind of a blended number with the demand as well. Yes. From a CapEx perspective, I think our expectation is around $600 million of CapEx for the year and I believe depreciation is around that $350 million number. I would say overall from a CapEx investment perspective, obviously, first and foremost, we're investing in our stores, we're investing in the maintenance of our stores, continue to ensure that they look great. We're investing in hubs and megahubs along the way. We also have a good -- a sizable investment in technology as well. We continue to invest in technology, both to enhance our existing systems as well as to add new functionality in order to improve our customer experience both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business as well. So, those are the major projects that we kind of continue to work on."

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2020 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Starting this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their hard work and dedication to delivering great customer service in light of a challenging sales environment this past quarter. As I mentioned on our last conference call, weather, during our second quarter each year, can be volatile and can significantly impact our performance. Coming off of a strong fall selling season, having delivered 3.4% same-store sales in Q1, we were confident in our ability to execute, but remained cautious heading into our second quarter. And as it has been widely reported, the winter weather was much milder in our second quarter than last year. While our sales were certainly meaningfully below plan and our expectations to deliver both, net income and EPS at the level we were, was commendable. We have an amazingly simple business, yet it has to be executed every day at a very high level across more than 6,400 locations in multiple countries and geographies in order to make everything work. This is where our culture continues to guide and differentiate us. This past quarter, we continued to focus on our many initiatives, not the least of which included incremental inventory replacements, megahub rollouts, ongoing enhancements to how we digitally interact with our commercial customers, and the rollout of our updated retail POS system. We feel both, our store presentation and customer service is second to none in our space. But, I can also tell you with full certainty, we are happy to put this quarter behind us and focus on delivering materially better sales performance for the remainder of the year. In providing a little more color this morning, I'll talk about the monthly sales cadence, regional sales performance differences, retail versus commercial, and lastly, merchandise categories impacted by the quarter's results. In regard to cadence for the quarter. As we completed the first two-thirds of our quarter, our same-store sales were positive but certainly below our plan and expectations. As you will recall, in the prior year, the winter weather was also mild until the last two weeks of our quarter, when the polar vortex arrived. As we were comparing against the mild winter with another one, our same-store sales were positive but our two-year growth was considerably softer than it was in our first quarter. At the end of this quarter, as we compared against the severe winter weather last year, our performance compared to last year was very poor with combined same-store sales down 6% for the last two weeks. However, on a two-year comp-store basis, the last four weeks of the quarter were substantially stronger than the first two-thirds of the quarter. Unfortunately, as we have stated many, many times, the timing of our second quarter can result in quite volatile sales performance, both good and bad. And the timing this year couldn't have been much worse. In the end, weather impacts normalized over time, and our focus is on our long-term performance. Our performance was particularly soft in the Midwestern and Northeastern markets where same-store sales ended 580 basis points lower in these northern markets than in our remaining markets and an even larger 1,700 basis points lower than the remaining markets over the last two weeks of our quarter. Our sales fall off was more pronounced for our DIY business than commercial, but we certainly saw the trajectory of our business slow during this timeframe for both businesses. With over 25% of our sales coming from our Midwestern and Northeastern markets, we could not make up for the sales shortfall from these areas from sales in other markets. Regarding merchandise mix during the quarter. Our cold weather businesses, think batteries, antifreeze and seasonal fluids, were down materially in total across retail and commercial combined. These categories are significant businesses for us, particularly in the winter, and they were our worst performing categories, and combined were down more than 9% on a same-store basis across the country for the quarter, and were both down north of 20% the last two weeks of the quarter. The testament to our team is how resilient our model is during changes in performance during certain periods. With a very challenged sales environment, our team delivered 2% growth in EBIT and grew earnings per share 7.8% for the quarter. This clearly didn't meet our expectations or aspirations, but was impressive nonetheless. Our financial model allows us to grow cash flow and EPS steadily. I'm very proud of how diligent our organization is in all business climates. During the quarter, our market share, based on the data available to us, was slightly positive through the end of January. While our sales performance for Q2 was comfortably below our plan and expectations, we haven't seen any material changes in the market or industry drivers beyond weather. We are excited to enter our third quarter where we began to enter our robust selling season, which is starting in earnest right now as federal tax refunds begin to reach our customers. We have had mild winters in the past, but each cycle is different. This year, we expect -- initially you're seeing a now normalized tax refund season. We believe both our retail and commercial businesses will improve from this quarter's results. We're also doing some great things that we feel will benefit sales over time. Our megahub store rollout continued along with key investments in technology. We believe these areas of investment allow us to further differentiate our offerings from our competitors or to close competitive gaps that may exist, allowing us to accelerate further in our industry. We opened two more megahubs this quarter and now have 39 locations. Our megahubs provide deep, very deep, local market coverage for hard-to-find parts. This is critical to both of our sectors but particularly important to our commercial business. And our store and commercial systems have and will continue to receive enhancements this year, making us easier for our customers to do business with, while simultaneously making it more efficient for our AutoZoners. As we enter our all-important sales season, our stores look great and our AutoZoners are doing an excellent job focusing on customer service. We believe we are ready for the remainder of the year. To provide specifics on the quarter, our total sales grew 2.6% this quarter. This compares to last quarter growing at 5.7%. Our DIY sales comps were down versus last year, while DIFM sales were up 8.2% in total. Both of these numbers were negatively affected by the calendar shift, causing a 63 basis-point headwind for the quarter. Regarding our domestic commercial business. We were up against 12.9% growth in the second quarter last year and a harder comparison to last quarter, but we expected we could reach positive double-digit growth. While we did not achieve our targeted double-digit goal for the quarter, we feel our team, across the organization from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers, credit team to ALLDATA, and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. So, with that approach, we will continue to be rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing significantly more than the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at mid-single-digit rate versus last year's second quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continued to produce for us. We averaged $9,400 in weekly commercial sales per program this past quarter, up 5% over last year. We have grown our sales with mature customers and mature programs at substantially improved growth rate the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and ability to enhance the customers' overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners' confidence regarding the commercial business continues to increase, and this will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. We believe there remains considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial as our customers are appreciating our new and enhanced offerings. Regarding our domestic DIY business. Regionally, we did better at West with the Northeast and Midwest performing quite poorly versus last year. As we reminded folks on last quarter's call, the second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalize as does our sales performance. In regard to modeling for the upcoming quarters, we feel there are enough tailwinds within the business that we are planning for sales growth from here for the remainder of the year. We also expect that as our initiatives roll out across the chain for both DIY and DIFM, they will add to improved sales performance. In regard to our technology investments, we have invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Recently, we rolled out our internally developed new POS system to our stores. This new system leverages new architecture and technologies that will expedite retail sales transactions by making the workflow more succinct and logical with touch screen capabilities and allowing us to make future changes much quicker as we replace some very old legacy codes. We've also done some important work behind the scenes that should help increase our agility by updating our store operating system and implementing a new human capital management system. We are also investing a great deal in our commercial systems. And as we continue to test these new technologies, we remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter's call, we highlighted that we were -- what we're seeing with tariffs. We noted that as a result of tariffs, we expected to have a higher amount of inflation in our cost of goods on a SKU-by-SKU basis than we had in the past. In past years, it was common for us to have deflation at the cost level, but due to tariffs, we began to see cost rise. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs onto our customers through higher retail prices. We were also successful in negotiating with certain vendors to share the costs from tariffs. However, we did have to incur some price increases. As certain tariffs are considerable in particular product lines, we intentionally passed those costs along in higher retails in tranches as we absorbed those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. At this point, we are not planning for any further tariffs on goods imported from China. And in fact, we are trying to get tariffs reduced by applying for relief through the U.S. customs office. To-date, tariffs and their impact on our cost in retails have been manageable. As we begin to lap the tariff cost and commensurate retail increases we implemented last year, we've been asked about the impact this will have on same-store sales. While we do not expect to incur the same like-for-like SKU inflation as in the past year, we don't believe the tariffs were a material net benefit over the last year, nor do we think there will be a significant headwind for the next 12 months. At this point, I'd like to talk about any disruption we may be seeing from the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. While we have not incurred disruption thus far, we must and are being diligent. We have created a contingency plan for each merchandise category sourced from China. Our teams have done a wonderful job planning for potential scenarios. At this point, we have nothing substantial to report. But the longer this outbreak lasts, the more it will impact ourselves, and both our and the overall retail industry. It is currently a very fluid situation as many of the factories have just begun to reopen after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Some are coming back on line quickly, while others quite slowly and certain of them haven't come back on line yet. The next few weeks will be critical. Turning to our omnichannel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, AutoZonePro mobile app, Duralast parts and ALLDATA. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in ship-to-home, next day delivery, and buy online pick-up in-store sales. But, omnichannel still represents a very small percentage of our business, substantially below 5%. We continue to see buy online and pick-up in-stores as our largest omnichannel business with its mix of omnichannel total sales at over 40% and higher than last year. Our BOPIS model continues to grow faster than our ship-to-home business, highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020, 40 years of wow customer service. We continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers: Exceptional service; fast deliveries; high quality parts and products; trustworthy advice; and flawless execution across the enterprise. We continue to identify and remove all redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our service levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us for the balance of the year. Along with improving local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we provide strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, while we were not pleased with our top line performance, we were pleased with our operating performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM, and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors such as relatively low gas prices and increasing miles driven remain largely in our favor. We remain committed to growing our market share in both, DIY and commercial. Now, let me provide more detail on what we accomplished during the quarter. For the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 25 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand our international footprint, opening two new stores in Mexico and one in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at 35.3%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business, provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It's important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to deliver great service to our customers and solid financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I'll turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill? Thank you, Bill. Clearly, our sales performance in Q2 was disappointing. We didn't achieve our plans nor our aspirations. We always know Q2, our shortest, lowest sales season, will be volatile. And this year, due to a very mild winter, our performance suffered and suffered mightily in specific weather-sensitive categories and in particular markets. As we analyze our performance in great detail, we are confident that the key driver this quarter was weather. As we cannot influence the weather and as we know weather impacts normalize over time, our goal is to ensure we understand the drivers of our business and then move on and focus on what we can control. Most of our senior team has been in this business and with this Company for decades. And we have seen this in the past and are focused on delivering optimal performance in the short term in light of the sales environment. But, our real focus isn't on any single quarters, but building our business for the long term. We all have seen enough cycles to know them when we see them. As we have recited internally, we weren't brilliant in the first quarter and lost our touch in the second. This too shall pass. With half fiscal 2020 behind us, we believe we continue to be very well positioned to grow sales and earnings for the remainder of the year. Many are now looking at previous mild winters and trying to extrapolate them to the balance of the year, as are we. But, there are always other key factors that impact our industry's performance, what is the timing of tax refunds, what's going to happen with summer weather patterns, where are we with the aging of the car park and sweet spots, and on and on and on. In the end, we believe our sales will strengthen from here. And our focus remains on managing this business to the optimum profitability based on the current industry sales environment, which will run through normal marginal cycles from time to time. Our team did just that in the second quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we commit that we will manage this business well, and we will manage it for the long term. Our business model is amazingly consistent. We generate a healthy amount of cash flow each and every year, and this year will be no different. Each year, we target to generate as much or more operating cash flow as the year before. And this year, we have the same target. Let me reiterate, we believe we are in good shape for the back half of the year. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for our customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives, and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners' workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that given the way of making the customer experience better for both the DIY and the professional customer. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We promise to remain committed to both, executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I'd like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately, rewards our shareholders. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning. Yes, sure. I appreciate the question. We have a longstanding practice. We release our earnings usually within two weeks and a couple of days of the end of the quarter. And we have a longstanding practice to not talk about such a short period of time. As we evidence with the last two weeks of the quarter, our business can be incredibly volatile over short periods of time, and we don't want anybody to try to extrapolate that good or bad for a 12-week quarter. So, we have longstanding practice to not talk about it. What we do say is, the second quarter is certainly more volatile than the third quarter. As we are entering the third quarter, we anticipate tax refunds coming. As I'm sure most of you have noticed, there was a significant amount of tax refund, $67 billion, that were issued last Wednesday that appears to be generally on track with where we were last year, and we're excited to enter this very important selling season for us. Yes. It's - again, one of those things is very hard to tell. As we talked about what happened with the end of the quarter, that could have -- Q2 could have been a net positive or a net negative. In the end, it was a net negative, because of the way that weather hit at the very end of the season. We anticipate we will get what's happened in the first half of the year back in the second, but it's going to depend somewhat on what happens around the beginning of the quarter and the ending of the quarters. Yes. I think, you're right, Simeon. I think it's the latter. As we begin to move into the spring season, what dominates our performance is no longer extreme weather patterns. In the winter time, and a lot of people won't look at what's happening with average temperatures, which is an indicator. But, what really matters to us in the winter time is when we get extreme cold for an extended period of time, three, four, five days. That puts a lot of pressure on failure parts. The other part that really matters to us is what's happening with road conditions. If we get a lot of snow and ice and freezing temperatures, that puts the road conditions in pretty bad shape, which puts more pressure on under car and brake systems. One of the things, as we enter this period of time, it's more about the maintenance categories. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that a lot of times everybody wants to compare to what's happened in the last three or four mild winters, and that's absolutely right, and we're doing the same thing. But there are other things that are happening in the environment. One of the things that's happened in some of the previous mild winters is we had a significant amount of our maintenance businesses that were pulled forward into Q2. You found not only was it not extreme cold temperatures but you had some very nice weekend weather and people did DIY jobs. We did not see that in Q2. So we are anticipating as these tax refunds flow, as the weather improves that we should have more robust maintenance performance. So, we've now opened 39 megahubs. We've stated externally that we want to get to 70 to 90. We are very aggressively pursuing those at this point in time, very pleased with the continued performance of our megahubs, and think that they are a key contributor to commercial. They are also a contributor to retail, but very pleased with that progress. I think adding a little bit of that too. We also -- and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, our up and down the street business continues to perform very, very well. We did see more challenges with our more national account business as many of which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest. So, we're encouraged by that as well. Yes, Bret. Great question. I should have clarified that in the prepared remarks. We don't have good visibility to market share gains and commercial. So, generally, we're growing commercial at 8% and the market has grown by 4%. We're pretty confident we're gaining share. My specific comments about growing share slightly are come up from a few different indications that we have on the DIY side of the business. Yes. I can't speak for theirs. We have certainly seen SKU-over-SKU year-over-year inflation. And the bigger change isn't that we've seen major inflation, it's generally that we've seen deflation. As you think about it, our parts come into the life cycle and they're very short run until the costs are more expensive. As the part become -- goes through the bell curve and becomes much more -- much higher volumes, our costs go down. And therefore, we have significant deflation as is shown in our LIFO -- major LIFO reserve that we've had forever. In the last 18 months or so, we have seen some inflation. We have been very careful about managing that inflation. And as we said in our prepared remarks, if we had a 25% tariff, we didn't go out and raise our price 25%. We went out and worked that in, in tranches so that we didn't shock the customer. Over time, we think we've done a pretty good job of rolling those price increases in. We've also worked with several of our partners on not pushing the full amount to the customer. There has been some changes in the RMB currency, and we've taken advantage of that. So, we've been very, I think, judicious about it. We don't think we saw a big net benefit as costs go up. There is some tampering down of demand. We don't think we saw a major significant net benefit and therefore we don't think we'll see a major significant net deficit. Yes, we can. On the productivity, we're always working on different productivity initiatives. But, if you're talking about are we changing the way we go to market in our supply chain by implementing a tremendous amount of new automation or those kind of things, at this point, we're not. We're constantly looking at the calculations of where the IRRs make sense. As wage pressure goes up, it changes the economics and we'll continue to look at it, but we don't have anything to talk about significantly currently. It's a very interesting question. As you would expect, over the last month or so, we have been very-focused on the supply chain aspects of coronavirus. And in the last week or two, more and more focused on what's happening here in the United States and ultimately, Mexico and Brazil. We see no indications at this point in time of any demand destruction as a result of coronavirus. But just like we said with the supply chain, it's an incredibly, incredibly fluid situation. I think, the next couple of weeks to a month are going to be critical to see what actually happens. We don't have good insights into that. There's a lot packed into that question. Yes, we haven't been big on talking about the ramifications of the car park over the last 12 years. We all know that there was a significant divot in new car sales in 2009. And as those cars came into the \u201csweet spot', there was a headwind for a while and now it looks like it's turned into a tailwind. I think it's on the margin in both instances. What we like to see is steady state new vehicles coming on the road, $16 million, $17 million. The scrappage rate doesn't appear to change much at all. And therefore, we just have a steady state of new cars. I don't think there's anything in the next two or three or four years, that's going to be radically different than what we've seen in the past. Yes, terrific question. I think what gives us the confidence is that we've been here before. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, most of our management team has been here for decades. We've seen times of strength; we've seen times of softness. We certainly saw softness in the second quarter. As we're looking at the second half of the year, we have concerns and we also have things that we're very positive about. On the concern side, I mentioned earlier that the roads, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast haven't had the kind of difficult conditions that put stress on brake systems and under car systems. That's likely to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the second half of the year. That said, unlike some other previous winters, we didn't see this significant pull forward of demand in those exact categories, which are heavily maintenance categories. So, we're looking at where we are. We absolutely are disappointed with the second quarter, but we don't see anything that changed as a result of the second quarter other than those road conditions. And therefore, we've made zero changes in our plans for the second half of the year. Again, to us, we are disappointed. We hate a bad quarter. But we're not managing this business for quarter-to-quarter. We're managing this business for long terms. And that's the approach we're going to continue to take and we're very optimistic that just like we've been very successful over the last decades, we're going to continue to be successful as we look forward. Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. And have a great day."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their dedicated, passionate service to our customers. I\u2019m routinely reminded of the tremendous links AutoZoners go to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, whether that\u2019s helping a retail customer, determine the cause of their problem, finding an extremely hard to find part for a commercial customer, or an ALLDATA ASE Master Tech walking the customer through an incredibly complicated repair, our AutoZoners across the Americas serve our customers with compassion, care and confidence. Our AutoZoners intense focus on the customer is the reason that I believe we have momentum and while we were able to deliver solid results this quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q1. This morning, we will review our major themes for the quarter. Specifically, we\u2019ll talk about same-store sales performance across months, regions and customer segments. Secondly, we\u2019ll update you on the initiatives we have in place to drive sales in both retail and commercial, including our ongoing investments in technology and inventory assortments that we believe continue to be a core reason for our sales growth. We\u2019ll also touch on the subject of tariffs and the impact of those on our business. Our total sales grew 5.7% this quarter versus last year. This was faster than Q4\u2019s growth of 5.4% adjusted for the 53rd week. This growth was in line with our expectations and was encouraging considering we knew we were up against accelerating commercial growth this same time last year. We gained traction in our retail business, as our DIY sales comp was just shy of 1%. Because of a shift in the timing of our quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter, we knew this would cause a headwind in the results for our overall comp. But even with the shift, we were quite pleased with our results. Also, the data we have on market share indicated, we were growing nicely versus the remainder of the market included in this competitive set. We feel we are well-positioned for our DIY business to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the year. Regarding our domestic DIFM business. Our sales grew 13.6% year-over-year. We were very pleased with this result considering we were up against growth of 11.3% in the first quarter last year. Considering this was the first quarter with a DIFM business had the lap double-digit sales growth, we knew this would not be an easy task. It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps continue to build our team across the organization, from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers credit team to ALLDATA and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. And with that approach, we are being rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing about three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory management, our inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at a higher clip than we did in last year\u2019s first quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings, as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continue to produce for us. The first quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of averaging more than $10,000 in weekly commercial sales per program. And we continue to grow our sales with mature customers in mature programs at a substantially improved growth rate, the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and the ability to enhance the customers\u2019 overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as the independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners have taken ownership of our success and are adding value to our commercial customers, which has and will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. That said, we believe there\u2019s still considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial, as our market share remains small. Regarding our domestic DIY business. We generated another positive same-store sales result for the quarter and an improvement in percentage growth year-over-year versus last quarter. Retail remains a very consistent, predictable story for us, as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial, but a predictable revenue stream and substantial profit and cash flow generator. All months of our quarter showed positive DIY same-store sales and we saw our best performance versus the previous year in November. On a two-year basis, our performance was very consistent each month. Last quarter, we mentioned the sales impact we were seeing with our Hispanic customer base. This quarter, we do not believe this impacted results, either across the country or specifically out in the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets. Regionally, we did better out West and we\u2019re a little softer in the Northeast. We believe the sales results in the Northeast were being impacted by weather and weather comparisons to last year. Overall, we were pleased with the performance and consistency in our retail business in Q1 and feel good about the remainder of the year. With that said, as is our historical practice, as we enter our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to remind everyone that weather patterns in this quarter can change significantly from year-to-year and, in particular, week-to-week. The second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalized, as does our sales performance. In our discussions with investors, there seems to be heightened questions regarding the stability of our retail business and its trajectory. While we cannot predict the future, we certainly can learn from the past. We have routinely said that our same-store sales generally trade in a pretty tight band and that remains true. To add a touch more specificity to that discussion, we\u2019ve had periods of underperformance and overperformance in our retail same-store sales. But over the last 25 quarters, our retail same-store sales have been positive for 21 of those 25 quarters. While many casual observers of our industry believe retail is contracting and commercial is accelerating, the facts according to Auto Care, our industry association do not support that notion. Their data has shown both sectors of the industry with very long-term consistent growth in the low to mid single-digit range, with commercial growing slightly faster. For us, we believe in the health of both our retail and commercial business. So if we sound upbeat about our sales opportunities for the remainder of 2020, we are, and I\u2019ll explain some of the reasons for our optimism. We have a number of initiatives we\u2019ve been executing. One major ongoing one is availability. Once again, we learned that adding inventory and additional parts coverage matters in local markets. This quarter, we set records for the highest in-stock position in our company\u2019s history. Congratulations to our supply chain team, merchant and operators. Great work. Additionally, we opened 11 new hub stores this quarter and now have 216 hub locations, 37 of which are megahubs. We continue to see sales ramping in markets where hub stores are added. We see it, of course, in the hubs themselves, but also in the surrounding market service by the hub. We are seeing these larger stores paying for themselves faster and faster in the maturation curve. And we\u2019re seeing them growing well past the first or second-year open. Our first couple of megahub locations opened in 2013, and they are still comping above the overall chain comp. We\u2019ll continue to open hubs for the foreseeable future, as we are utilizing them as distribution nodes for hard to find parts, adding to our local market inventory availability. Hub stores are also helping us with our online orders for next day delivery. It is an efficient way to have and leverage all the product in the local market and improves our ability to meet customer demand, regardless of channel in a very cost-effective manner. Next, we have been spending a significant amount of time, effort and resources to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience. We\u2019ve invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Our IT spend has comfortably increased by double digits for the last few years. At the end of the quarter, we began to roll out after a considerable amount of time, due diligence and testing a new point-of-sale system to our stores. This system leverages new architectures and technologies that will expedite the transaction by making the workflow more succinct and logical, with touchscreen capabilities, and will allow us to make future changes much quicker as we replace very old legacy code, all to enhance the customer experience. We\u2019ve also done some important work behind the scenes that should help our agility by updating our store operating system, expanding the number of available skews our systems can handle and updating our human capital system. We\u2019re also investing a great deal in our commercial systems as we continue to test these new technology. We remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter\u2019s call, we highlighted what we were seeing with tariffs. We noted that as the result of the tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs on to our customers. We were successful in negotiating with certain vendors, reducing the impact of the tariffs. However, we did have to raise some prices. As some of the tariff increases are considerable, in particular, select product lines, we\u2019ve been intentionally passing those costs along in tranches, as we absorb those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. If the tariffs remain, we intend to pass additional cost increases on through increased retails. The tariffs has \u2013 have resulted in SKU-to-SKU inflation, which differs from our historical experience. To date, tariffs and their impact on our cost and retail has been manageable and not a significant driver of our business results one way or the other. Turning to our omni-channel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, the new duralastparts website and alldata. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in our shift to home next day delivery and buy online pick up in store sales. But omni-channel will \u2013 still represents a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%. Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of the U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and received their products at their home the very next day. We continue to see buy online pick up in store is our largest omni-channel business by a pretty wide margin. This BOPIS model is also growing faster than our ship to home businesses highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model, where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020 40 years of wow customer service, we continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high-quality parts and products, trustworthy advice, and flawless execution across the enterprise. In 2020, we continue to challenge our leadership teams to reduce the time of redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us in 2020. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we are providing strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, we were pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry stream in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors, such as a relatively low gas prices and increasing miles-driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, total sales increased 5.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.4%. This performance was generally in line with our expectations, but we did have an unfavorable comparison in sales due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week this past year. Our same-store sales would have been 68 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. Regionally, the markets West of the Mississippi outperformed the Eastern half of the U.S. The Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets were our lowest performance, but we see in our underperforming markets consistent performance on the two-year stack basis. During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 24 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand our international footprint opening two new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 35.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts to again deliver solid results for our first fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?\nWilliam Giles: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 5.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,864,000. This is up from an average of $1,792,000 at Q1 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 13.6% in the quarter. Commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $75 million over last year\u2019s Q1. We are encouraged to highlight for the quarter, our domestic commercial weekly sales averaged approximately $10,600 per program, the third quarter in a row of sales above $10,000. This was an increase of 10.2% from last year\u2019s $9,600 in average weekly sales per program for our first quarter. And that $9,600 was up 8% over the year before, a very strong acceleration. We now have our commercial program in 4,917 stores, or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened two new stores during the first quarter ending the quarter with 606 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. Regarding Brazil. We now operate 37 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring a substantial per store annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 8 basis points versus last year\u2019s first quarter. The slight increase in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing. I do want to stress to remain, we remain committed to taking costs out of our business where appropriate and feel we can save on costs from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment. And we\u2019ve been pleased with our growth, driven by the acceleration we\u2019ve experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, deleveraging 65 basis points to last year\u2019s first quarter. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters\u2019 conference calls, the investments we have made, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $500 million. Our EBIT margin was 17.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.7 million, up 12.1% from Q1 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $41.4 million last year Q2. Our higher forecast than last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,287,000 million, or approximately $130 million above last year\u2019s Q1 ending balance of $5,156,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 23.2% versus 21.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate only benefited 33 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 250 basis points. Unfortunately, stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and they can come in waves driving substantial fluctuations positive and negative in our tax rate and ultimately in our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises, because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $350 million relatively flat to last year\u2019s first quarter because it was depressed by previously discussed higher tax rate due to the reduced stock option exercises. Our diluted share count of $24.5 million was down 6.1% from last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 6.2% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Assuming a consistent tax rate in both periods, EPS would have increased 8.3%. Relating to the cash flow statement. For the first quarter, we generated $447 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.2% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $101 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 22 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,790 stores in the U.S., 606 stores in Mexico and 37 in Brazil for a total store count of $6,433. Depreciation totaled $89.8 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter expense of $82.5 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. Effective the first day of this fiscal year September 1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that required the company to recognize operating assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. You will see that we have recorded just under a $2.6 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets to the balance sheet, as displayed in our highlights pages attached to our press release. We do not expect this to have an impact on our leverage. We repurchased $450 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $497 million in last year. At quarter-end, we had $1,277 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 9.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $694,000 versus $658,000 last year and $674,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $71,000 versus a negative $59,000 last year and a negative $85,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 110.3% versus last year\u2019s Q1 of 108.9%, a solid improvement. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital. For the trailing four quarters of 35.5%, we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter, delivering 3.4% same-store sales growth, while strong was in line with our expectations. Over the last five quarters or so, we have made incremental operating expense investments in our business with an expectation that we would improve our competitive position and therefore, increase market share in both sectors accelerating our sales growth. We\u2019ve been pleased with those investments, which were primarily in labor and technology. Our labor investments have resulted in reduced turnover of our most tenured knowledgeable customer-facing AutoZoners. And as we begin to deploy these new technologies, we expect them to enhance the customer and AutoZoners experience. In fiscal 2019, we shared well in advance that we would have accelerating SG&A expenses, which would lead to reduced EBIT growth for the fiscal year. We delivered on that commitment and slightly overperformed our expectations regarding EBIT in 2019. As we embark on fiscal 2020, we still have elements of our expense structure that are growing faster than historical rates. But our expectation is to have higher than historical sales growth like we have experienced in the last several quarters. For fiscal 2020, our expectation is the higher expected sales growth, will lead to EBIT growth rates above the last four quarters and approaching our more typical low to single \u2013 mid single-digit levels. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level, which we believe is in our line of sight. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must keep managing to our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that get in the way of making the customer experience better, both for do-it-yourself customer and the professional customers. We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals will remain solid as we see positive year-over-year miles-driven statistics and the aging vehicle characteristics in our markets continued to encourage us about the New Year. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We believe our balanced earnings and cash-generating model allows us to deliver steady growth as our history suggests. We promised to remain committed to both executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I would like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately rewards our shareholders. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about commercial a little bit. I mean, obviously a lot of progress over the last 12 months. When you look at the growth of commercial, how do we think about growth coming from existing customers versus progress winning new customers? And then as you look out over the next 12 months, maybe you just talk about some of the incremental drivers that give you confidence that you can sustain the momentum in that channel? Thanks.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Thank you. Well, regarding the \u2013 where the growth is coming from, I\u2019m even mentioned in our prepared remarks that we\u2019re seeing significant growth from mature customers who happen to be in mature programs. So most of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and most of the change in the growth that we\u2019re seeing is coming from existing customers that we\u2019ve had, whether they were up and down the street or national account customers. We\u2019re just penetrating those customers much deeper than we were before. Regarding where we go from here. Obviously, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But I will tell you when we look back over this acceleration over the last five quarters, it has not been one thing. It has been due to several different initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place and frankly, been in the works for several years, whether that\u2019s inventory assortment improvements, where that\u2019s getting our store managers and district managers involved, whether it\u2019s they building the reputation and the brand of the Duralast products that we sell, there has been a whole host of different things that we believe have contributed to this growth. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we do know that we have several other initiatives in front of us on the commercial front, particularly technology initiatives that we have not rolled out yet and we\u2019re excited about what the prospects of those initiatives will mean in the future.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thanks for that Bill. And then just a follow-up question on pricing trends. I think you had talked about raising prices this year in phases or tranches. I assume there\u2019s more starting to come through now. Can you just talk about the consumer reaction, any signs of elasticity? And it sounds like your tone on the consumer overall is very healthy. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of elasticity? Thanks.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. It\u2019s really hard to see it. Certainly, in certain product categories, we\u2019ve seen the tariffs come in and they\u2019ve been meaningful. But we have not taken the full cost impact because of our weighted average cost accounting model. So those costs come in over time as the inventory turns. So we have moved our retails up, as I said, in tranches. And when we\u2019ve seen them go up, we have seen some elasticity of demand in certain categories, not a ton. At the end of the day, when we look at the impact of the inflation in the retails and the elasticity, we don\u2019t think net-net, it\u2019s having a significant impact on our business yet. But again, we still have a long way to go, because we haven\u2019t absorbed all those costs and then who knows where the tariffs go from here.\nSeth Sigman: Great. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill Rhodes, in your prepared remarks, you expressed a lot of optimism about the outlook for the DIY business. Is that A, what factors are driving that enthusiasm? And B, do you think that\u2019s more of an AutoZone specific story, or a broader industry story? Because some of your competitors are either seeing decelerating DIY traffic and/or more volatility in the results of their DIY business?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Michael, I would say, I had the same optimism I have had for about 25 years. I believe in the retail business. There \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people, as I mentioned, that think that the retail business is going away that it\u2019s declining and the commercial business is rapidly growing. If you go back to our 1991 Annual Report, we are trying to dispute the myth that the retail business is declining. I\u2019m trying to continue to dispel that myth. And the easiest way for me to do is talk about what has transpired over the last 25 quarters. 25 quarters, 21 of them have had positive same-store sales for AutoZone. Now I don\u2019t know what other people are experiencing. But I also mentioned enough, continued to mention that our retail business, in particular, it does not fluctuate that much quarter-to-quarter. It- our performance is in a pretty tight band. Now this quarter, we did particularly well, especially if you consider the shift, the calendar shift that impacted us, that would have been one of our stellar quarters. We\u2019re also going to have quarters that aren\u2019t as strong. That\u2019s just the nature of the business, but it trades from slightly down to up one or two points. And it\u2019s been doing that for as long as I\u2019ve been in this business.\nMichael Lasser: Over that last 25 years, there has been a market share shift from smaller independent and regional players to the larger players. Over time, should we see more share being shifted between and amongst the larger players just because there\u2019s less consolidation and fragmentation within the market?\nWilliam Rhodes: I think you\u2019re going to continue to see it come from those smaller folks, it\u2019s what\u2019s happened overall. When I got in this business, there were about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Today, there\u2019s about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Now a lot more of them are in the hands of us and our close-in competitors. But there\u2019s still a whole lot out there that aren\u2019t by us.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And then my second question is, you\u2019ve deployed a lot of investment, a lot of technology. And I think you\u2019re seeing good returns on that and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of the very healthy growth within your DIFM segment. How much more opportunity and you mentioned further technology investments you are going to be rolling out? How much more opportunity is there to deploy investments to generate these types of returns? And should \u2013 how should we think about the growth rate of SG&A dollars, specifically in the next couple of quarters as a result of that?\nWilliam Rhodes: As I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to continue to have elevated SG&A expenses. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on some substantial new technology-oriented initiatives that frankly you haven\u2019t seen yet. And therefore, we haven\u2019t begun to expense them yet. They\u2019re showing up through the capital expense line. But because we haven\u2019t deployed them, we\u2019re not depreciating them. Those are coming. There\u2019s some on the DIY side, like I mentioned, the new POS system. We also have several on the commercial side that will be coming over the next six months or so.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Good luck and have a good holiday.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, too, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just want to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question. I think the first one on the DIY business. Bill, I think you said, we expect the strength or strong results to continue specifically around DIY. I know you don\u2019t really give guidance, especially by segment. But does that suggest that the run rate of DIY should improve going forward, or that the consistent healthy trends continue going forward?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. What I\u2019m trying to say is, remember, DIY does \u2013 it trades in a very tight band. We had a strong quarter this quarter. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next quarter or the quarter after that. But overall, we believe in the long-term health of the DIY business. That\u2019s the message that I\u2019m trying to make sure that we convey. I also want to put an exclamation point of something else that I said in the script. And that is that the second quarter is always very volatile. And part of it has to do with when the quarter ends, it ends right around Valentine\u2019s Day, which is when the season shift, when tax refunds begin to hit the marketplace. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the second quarter. It\u2019s always volatile and we just want to make sure everybody realizes that.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Okay. My follow-up is, you also made a comment towards the ending of the call about how EBIT growth should approach some of that \u2013 your historic rates over time. If you look at the balance right now, where your comps are growing nicely, you seem to be taking share in the industry. You are investing, but your implication that it\u2019s going to approach it over time means that these investments can subside and the top line momentum should continue. In another way of asking it is why not maintain the current algorithm in which EBIT growth continues to grow steadily maybe at a lower rate and \u2013 but you continue to take market share, which seems like you\u2019re able to do and there\u2019s lots of it. So I guess, how much debate is there? Why not continue a higher level of investment to continue growing at an appropriate rate and as long as the market is giving you credit for it?\nWilliam Giles: Yes. I think overall, I mean, our objective, as Bill said, is over the long-term to grow our EBIT at a low to mid single-digit rate. We\u2019ve got a fair number of investments that were current that we\u2019ve made and that we\u2019re currently working on, as Bill highlighted, many in technology. And many, for example, in the hubs and megahubs, which we\u2019ve had terrific results on and we\u2019ll continue to invest in hubs and megahubs, which will also elevate some of our inventory levels as well. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business as we gained momentum. I think, we have a fairly long track record of being able to manage, both margin and expenses in light of this kind of sales performance that we\u2019re producing and we continue to expect to do that over the long haul.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nMatthew McClintock: Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter as well. I was wondering if we could just follow-up on Seth\u2019s question just about commercial \u2013 the commercial business in general. I think, you said that\u2019s the bulk of the gains have been coming from mature markets, mature customers. I was wondering is the growth rate from new customers or the contribution from new customers accelerating as well? That\u2019s my first question.\nWilliam Rhodes: I think it\u2019s accelerating as the entire business accelerates. The point that we\u2019re trying to make sure is that the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen over the last six quarters or so has been our mature customer growth has changed significantly.\nMatthew McClintock: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as you look today now that you\u2019ve actually comped the comp or compared against more difficult growth rates within that business. Taking a step back a year ago versus today, would you say that you\u2019re more optimistic about the growth potential for that business than you were a year ago? And meaning, longer-term, do you think that your comp algorithm could actually accelerate from here simply from that confidence that you just sold this quarter?\nWilliam Rhodes: Well, our confidence isn\u2019t going to determine whether we\u2019re successful or not unfortunately. I think, we certainly have a higher level of confidence, because we\u2019ve done it for five quarters. I would say more importantly than that, we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in front of us. Now you said something I want to make sure that I\u2019m not saying. I\u2019m not saying our sales are going to accelerate from here in commercial, I don\u2019t know. But I feel like we will continue to outperform the industry by hopefully a substantial margin. That\u2019s 10% or 15%, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m really excited about the initiatives that we have in front of us. And the \u2013 basically, the momentum that we\u2019re building in the marketplace from our inventory availability to the power of the Duralast brand to service that our customers are seeing from our AutoZoners just, as I\u2019ve talked to customers, I see a whole different level of confidence that our customers have in us and our ability to service their needs.\nMatthew McClintock: Perfect. Thanks for the color. Happy holidays, guys.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nElizabeth Lane Suzuki: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about private label penetration broadly? And what percentage of your sales is in private label currently? And what the next initiatives are for the Duralast brand?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I mean, we feel terrific about the Duralast brand, which is the largest brand \u2013 about the largest brand in aftermarket auto parts and we have over 50% of our sales come from our private label products. And the merchandising organization has done a terrific job of continuing to expand that brand across categories. And it continues to have a very high penetration and it\u2019s very well received by the customers, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side both. And so our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to develop the brand, broaden it out, continue to find further opportunities in other categories where we can do further line extensions on Duralast and Valucraft and Duralast Gold brand all together.\nElizabeth Lane Suzuki: And are there certain product categories, where Duralast is not currently high in your lineup of products, and where do you think there\u2019s a big opportunity?\nWilliam Rhodes: I think on some of those would be, some of the ones that are more dominated by national brands, for example, in oil and those kinds of categories that maybe they\u2019re already is an existing dominant national brand. But in many categories, we find that there continues to be significant opportunities from both Duralast and other private label products that we have.\nElizabeth Lane Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker of Nomura. Your line is now open.\nMichael Baker: Thank you. Within the margin outlook, it sounds like your sales have been up 5% each of the last few quarters adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter and you\u2019re talking about profits up low-to-mid single digits. So I guess that might imply some chance for margins to still be down. Is that right? And can you talk about your expectations of gross margins versus SG&A?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I mean, your math is right. And I would say that gross margin, we feel good about. I mean this quarter, we had a relatively flat, I think, was up 8 basis points on gross margin. So we feel pretty good about our ability to be able to continue to manage gross margin. Obviously, we get continued pressures from tariffs, et cetera. But the merchandising organization has done a great job of continuing to find opportunities to lower our costs. So we feel pretty good about the health of gross margin. And yes, on the SG&A front, we\u2019re going to continue to make the investments that we have made, many of which are focused on wages, as well as technology over the long haul. And so we expect there to be a little bit of pressure on that. But again, as Bill mentioned before, and we\u2019ve mentioned, that our goal is to continue to grow EBIT on a low-to-mid single-digit over the long-term.\nMichael Baker: Okay, understood. And then a quick follow-up. Just on the calendar shift, how does that impact 2Q where I think you pick up a February week, but lose a November week?\nWilliam Giles: Yes. I think it depends on what happens in that week in February, as I\u2019ve talked about a couple of times already. That particular point in the calendar is very volatile. The last time we had this, it was very favorable to our second quarter results. We don\u2019t know what will happen this time. But we\u2019ll let you know, it could easily be favorable or it could easily be unfavorable, just depends on that \u2013 what happens right around Valentine\u2019s Day.\nMichael Baker: Understood. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yep. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nZachary Fadem: Hey, good morning. Could you talk a little more about the comp impact in markets where megahubs are added? And how that compares to the overall fleet? And then just as the hub presence matures, could you walk us through the comp trajectory and how those markets tend to perform after the opening?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I would say on the megahub markets, I mean, we continue to see good performance out of them and not to dissect it too much. But it depends on how broad the market is and how close then the market is. And keep in mind that we only have 37 megahubs today. And frankly, the vast majority of them are relatively immature. So I think, we\u2019re still identifying what we believe to be the maturation curve from a sales perspective on megahubs. But we continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year improvements that the megahubs perform. Hubs have a little bit more maturity to them. But again, we\u2019re doing things that are helping drive the business overall adding more inventory, et cetera. So it becomes a little non-comparable when you look at some of the hubs today versus where they were like maybe five years ago in terms of what we\u2019ve done inside the box to be able to drive sales. So the short answer is that, the maturation curve of both hubs and megahubs is still evolving. We continue to be very pleased with the investments that we\u2019re making and see that the improvements that we can drive and we will continue to invest in that category.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. That makes sense. And could you also speak to the margin trajectory of the commercial business, whether you\u2019ve seen any improvement in incremental margins, as that business has gained scale? And are there any opportunities that you think are out there to drive higher commercial margins now that you\u2019re slowing the new commercial program investments?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I would say, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re \u2013 I think the margin for commercial continues to remain healthy and there are obviously opportunities for us to improve margin on both sides of the business. But at the same time, keep in mind, that we\u2019re growing commercial at a rapid rate, but we\u2019re also making some investments and that\u2019s helping drive that. So over the long-term, I would expect margins to improve as some of those investments become more mature. But over the shorter-term, I would expect our margins to remain stable.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate the time.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is David [indiscernible] on for Greg. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWilliam Rhodes: Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I want to talk about the DIY business a bit as well. So if we just take a step back and look at the big picture, so employment level was still strong, coupled with low gas prices across most of the country. So at this point, should DIY potentially be comping at the higher-end of that tight band that you talked about maybe 0% to 1% or so. I\u2019m just trying to gauge where that business is now and what\u2019s the correct run rate for comps in DIY. for where we are in the cycle?\nWilliam Rhodes: All great questions. I just keep going back to \u2013 it trades in such a tight band that it\u2019s really hard to say. We certainly think lower gas mileage is beneficial. We think miles-driven increases are beneficial. But there\u2019s so minuscule that they\u2019re just not big drivers of the business overall. We think the most important driver of what happens with the DIY business is what our AutoZoner do to provide great service to our customers. And I think we\u2019re doing a really, really good job of that right now. The morale of this organization of our teams in our stores, in particular, they know they\u2019re winning. They feel like they\u2019re winning. They feel good about it. And I think that that\u2019s translating into better service, which is translating into better performance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then my follow-up on the expense growth. So up high-single digits again here in Q1 and you\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s going to remain elevated. But with the acceleration in comp sales we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, is there any thought as to pushing on these tech and store-based investments even further and above your initial plans now that we\u2019re seeing the benefit come through the top line?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Most of those investments take time. And so there\u2019s a lot of things in the pipeline. So we might like to accelerate some of them, but there is a certain amount that we can digest as an organization. There\u2019s a certain pace at which we can develop those initiatives. So we will continue to work hard. We will continue to drive them where we can. But I expect it to be a little bit more steady state.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks, again, and congrats on a nice quarter.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nWilliam Giles: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGregory Melich: Hi. Thanks. So I\u2019ll make a count. So first, I want to circle back. Thanks for your \u2013 the incremental on the tariffs. I know we\u2019ve started to see some exemptions coming through and also \u2013 but we still have the timing of pricing through what\u2019s already happened. Could you help us understand, is that any potential benefit maybe from refunds coming from any exemptions on certain products? And then when we think about further price increases, is it just as simple as taking when the tariffs went up and then thinking about your inventory turning once a year as to when that would actually flow through?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I think the second part of that is absolutely right, Greg, and it\u2019s going to depend on the categories. Certain categories turn faster or slower than other categories. So as we turn that inventory, the cost or the cost in our gross margin increase. And we\u2019re trying to manage that consistent with how we manage the retail increases. For the sole purpose of not shocking the system, we\u2019ve had lots of different cost increases over the years for a variety of reasons, whether that\u2019s all based prices going up, lead, steel, whatever the case might be. But when it\u2019s 25%, that\u2019s a significant increase. And so we\u2019re trying to do that over three or four tranches, so not to shock the system and to try to provide the customer with as good value as we can for as long as we can. So far, I\u2019m very pleased with how our merchants have managed those issues. What was the first part of your question, Greg.?\nGregory Melich: The first part was we started to see some exemptions from the USTR on certain product SKUs. Has that \u2013 does that happen in for you guys on anything material?\nWilliam Rhodes: We have filed some exceptions, don\u2019t know all the answers at this point in time. Some of them would impact us in a beneficial way if we were able to get them.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And then on inventory, I know that\u2019s been growing up 9%. Is that a timing issue, or is it just up against a lower comparison? What should we think about that as a normal growth rate back towards sales in coming quarters?\nWilliam Giles: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be back towards sales in coming quarters. You have some inflation baked in there as well on the inventory. And then again, I think a couple of points that I\u2019m going to refer that Bill pointed out highest in-stock level ever with a corporation, continued investments in hub and megahubs, again, inventory closer into the customer wins and we\u2019re going to continue to go down that path. We want to continue to maintain our AP to inventory ratio above a 100% and we have successfully. I think that we\u2019ll probably be at this level a little bit lower maybe, but not certainly at a sales growth rate.\nGregory Melich: That\u2019s great. Congratulations, guys, and have a great holiday.\nWilliam Giles: You, too, happy holidays.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Greg.\nWilliam Rhodes: Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we\u2019re confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And we\u2019d like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Giles",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 5.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,864,000. This is up from an average of $1,792,000 at Q1 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 13.6% in the quarter. Commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $75 million over last year's Q1. We are encouraged to highlight for the quarter, our domestic commercial weekly sales averaged approximately $10,600 per program, the third quarter in a row of sales above $10,000. This was an increase of 10.2% from last year's $9,600 in average weekly sales per program for our first quarter. And that $9,600 was up 8% over the year before, a very strong acceleration. We now have our commercial program in 4,917 stores, or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened two new stores during the first quarter ending the quarter with 606 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. Regarding Brazil. We now operate 37 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring a substantial per store annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 8 basis points versus last year's first quarter. The slight increase in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing. I do want to stress to remain, we remain committed to taking costs out of our business where appropriate and feel we can save on costs from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment. And we've been pleased with our growth, driven by the acceleration we've experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, deleveraging 65 basis points to last year's first quarter. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters' conference calls, the investments we have made, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $500 million. Our EBIT margin was 17.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.7 million, up 12.1% from Q1 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $41.4 million last year Q2. Our higher forecast than last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,287,000 million, or approximately $130 million above last year's Q1 ending balance of $5,156,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 23.2% versus 21.7% in last year's first quarter. This quarter's rate only benefited 33 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 250 basis points. Unfortunately, stock option exercises aren't predictable and they can come in waves driving substantial fluctuations positive and negative in our tax rate and ultimately in our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises, because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $350 million relatively flat to last year's first quarter because it was depressed by previously discussed higher tax rate due to the reduced stock option exercises. Our diluted share count of $24.5 million was down 6.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 6.2% over the prior year's first quarter. Assuming a consistent tax rate in both periods, EPS would have increased 8.3%. Relating to the cash flow statement. For the first quarter, we generated $447 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.2% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $101 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 22 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,790 stores in the U.S., 606 stores in Mexico and 37 in Brazil for a total store count of $6,433. Depreciation totaled $89.8 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $82.5 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. Effective the first day of this fiscal year September 1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that required the company to recognize operating assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. You will see that we have recorded just under a $2.6 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets to the balance sheet, as displayed in our highlights pages attached to our press release. We do not expect this to have an impact on our leverage. We repurchased $450 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $497 million in last year. At quarter-end, we had $1,277 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company's inventory increased 9.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $694,000 versus $658,000 last year and $674,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $71,000 versus a negative $59,000 last year and a negative $85,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 110.3% versus last year's Q1 of 108.9%, a solid improvement. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital. For the trailing four quarters of 35.5%, we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Yes. I think overall, I mean, our objective, as Bill said, is over the long-term to grow our EBIT at a low to mid single-digit rate. We've got a fair number of investments that were current that we've made and that we're currently working on, as Bill highlighted, many in technology. And many, for example, in the hubs and megahubs, which we've had terrific results on and we'll continue to invest in hubs and megahubs, which will also elevate some of our inventory levels as well. So we're going to continue to invest in the business as we gained momentum. I think, we have a fairly long track record of being able to manage, both margin and expenses in light of this kind of sales performance that we're producing and we continue to expect to do that over the long haul. Yes. I think it depends on what happens in that week in February, as I've talked about a couple of times already. That particular point in the calendar is very volatile. The last time we had this, it was very favorable to our second quarter results. We don't know what will happen this time. But we'll let you know, it could easily be favorable or it could easily be unfavorable, just depends on that \u2013 what happens right around Valentine's Day. Thank you. I don't think we'll be back towards sales in coming quarters. You have some inflation baked in there as well on the inventory. And then again, I think a couple of points that I'm going to refer that Bill pointed out highest in-stock level ever with a corporation, continued investments in hub and megahubs, again, inventory closer into the customer wins and we're going to continue to go down that path. We want to continue to maintain our AP to inventory ratio above a 100% and we have successfully. I think that we'll probably be at this level a little bit lower maybe, but not certainly at a sales growth rate. You, too, happy holidays."

            "name": "William Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2020 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their dedicated, passionate service to our customers. I'm routinely reminded of the tremendous links AutoZoners go to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, whether that's helping a retail customer, determine the cause of their problem, finding an extremely hard to find part for a commercial customer, or an ALLDATA ASE Master Tech walking the customer through an incredibly complicated repair, our AutoZoners across the Americas serve our customers with compassion, care and confidence. Our AutoZoners intense focus on the customer is the reason that I believe we have momentum and while we were able to deliver solid results this quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q1. This morning, we will review our major themes for the quarter. Specifically, we'll talk about same-store sales performance across months, regions and customer segments. Secondly, we'll update you on the initiatives we have in place to drive sales in both retail and commercial, including our ongoing investments in technology and inventory assortments that we believe continue to be a core reason for our sales growth. We'll also touch on the subject of tariffs and the impact of those on our business. Our total sales grew 5.7% this quarter versus last year. This was faster than Q4's growth of 5.4% adjusted for the 53rd week. This growth was in line with our expectations and was encouraging considering we knew we were up against accelerating commercial growth this same time last year. We gained traction in our retail business, as our DIY sales comp was just shy of 1%. Because of a shift in the timing of our quarter versus last year's first quarter, we knew this would cause a headwind in the results for our overall comp. But even with the shift, we were quite pleased with our results. Also, the data we have on market share indicated, we were growing nicely versus the remainder of the market included in this competitive set. We feel we are well-positioned for our DIY business to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the year. Regarding our domestic DIFM business. Our sales grew 13.6% year-over-year. We were very pleased with this result considering we were up against growth of 11.3% in the first quarter last year. Considering this was the first quarter with a DIFM business had the lap double-digit sales growth, we knew this would not be an easy task. It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps continue to build our team across the organization, from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers credit team to ALLDATA and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. And with that approach, we are being rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing about three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory management, our inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at a higher clip than we did in last year's first quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings, as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continue to produce for us. The first quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of averaging more than $10,000 in weekly commercial sales per program. And we continue to grow our sales with mature customers in mature programs at a substantially improved growth rate, the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and the ability to enhance the customers' overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as the independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners have taken ownership of our success and are adding value to our commercial customers, which has and will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. That said, we believe there's still considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial, as our market share remains small. Regarding our domestic DIY business. We generated another positive same-store sales result for the quarter and an improvement in percentage growth year-over-year versus last quarter. Retail remains a very consistent, predictable story for us, as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial, but a predictable revenue stream and substantial profit and cash flow generator. All months of our quarter showed positive DIY same-store sales and we saw our best performance versus the previous year in November. On a two-year basis, our performance was very consistent each month. Last quarter, we mentioned the sales impact we were seeing with our Hispanic customer base. This quarter, we do not believe this impacted results, either across the country or specifically out in the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets. Regionally, we did better out West and we're a little softer in the Northeast. We believe the sales results in the Northeast were being impacted by weather and weather comparisons to last year. Overall, we were pleased with the performance and consistency in our retail business in Q1 and feel good about the remainder of the year. With that said, as is our historical practice, as we enter our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to remind everyone that weather patterns in this quarter can change significantly from year-to-year and, in particular, week-to-week. The second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalized, as does our sales performance. In our discussions with investors, there seems to be heightened questions regarding the stability of our retail business and its trajectory. While we cannot predict the future, we certainly can learn from the past. We have routinely said that our same-store sales generally trade in a pretty tight band and that remains true. To add a touch more specificity to that discussion, we've had periods of underperformance and overperformance in our retail same-store sales. But over the last 25 quarters, our retail same-store sales have been positive for 21 of those 25 quarters. While many casual observers of our industry believe retail is contracting and commercial is accelerating, the facts according to Auto Care, our industry association do not support that notion. Their data has shown both sectors of the industry with very long-term consistent growth in the low to mid single-digit range, with commercial growing slightly faster. For us, we believe in the health of both our retail and commercial business. So if we sound upbeat about our sales opportunities for the remainder of 2020, we are, and I'll explain some of the reasons for our optimism. We have a number of initiatives we've been executing. One major ongoing one is availability. Once again, we learned that adding inventory and additional parts coverage matters in local markets. This quarter, we set records for the highest in-stock position in our company's history. Congratulations to our supply chain team, merchant and operators. Great work. Additionally, we opened 11 new hub stores this quarter and now have 216 hub locations, 37 of which are megahubs. We continue to see sales ramping in markets where hub stores are added. We see it, of course, in the hubs themselves, but also in the surrounding market service by the hub. We are seeing these larger stores paying for themselves faster and faster in the maturation curve. And we're seeing them growing well past the first or second-year open. Our first couple of megahub locations opened in 2013, and they are still comping above the overall chain comp. We'll continue to open hubs for the foreseeable future, as we are utilizing them as distribution nodes for hard to find parts, adding to our local market inventory availability. Hub stores are also helping us with our online orders for next day delivery. It is an efficient way to have and leverage all the product in the local market and improves our ability to meet customer demand, regardless of channel in a very cost-effective manner. Next, we have been spending a significant amount of time, effort and resources to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience. We've invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Our IT spend has comfortably increased by double digits for the last few years. At the end of the quarter, we began to roll out after a considerable amount of time, due diligence and testing a new point-of-sale system to our stores. This system leverages new architectures and technologies that will expedite the transaction by making the workflow more succinct and logical, with touchscreen capabilities, and will allow us to make future changes much quicker as we replace very old legacy code, all to enhance the customer experience. We've also done some important work behind the scenes that should help our agility by updating our store operating system, expanding the number of available skews our systems can handle and updating our human capital system. We're also investing a great deal in our commercial systems as we continue to test these new technology. We remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter's call, we highlighted what we were seeing with tariffs. We noted that as the result of the tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs on to our customers. We were successful in negotiating with certain vendors, reducing the impact of the tariffs. However, we did have to raise some prices. As some of the tariff increases are considerable, in particular, select product lines, we've been intentionally passing those costs along in tranches, as we absorb those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. If the tariffs remain, we intend to pass additional cost increases on through increased retails. The tariffs has \u2013 have resulted in SKU-to-SKU inflation, which differs from our historical experience. To date, tariffs and their impact on our cost and retail has been manageable and not a significant driver of our business results one way or the other. Turning to our omni-channel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, the new duralastparts website and alldata. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in our shift to home next day delivery and buy online pick up in store sales. But omni-channel will \u2013 still represents a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%. Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of the U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and received their products at their home the very next day. We continue to see buy online pick up in store is our largest omni-channel business by a pretty wide margin. This BOPIS model is also growing faster than our ship to home businesses highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model, where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020 40 years of wow customer service, we continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high-quality parts and products, trustworthy advice, and flawless execution across the enterprise. In 2020, we continue to challenge our leadership teams to reduce the time of redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us in 2020. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we are providing strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, we were pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry stream in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors, such as a relatively low gas prices and increasing miles-driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, total sales increased 5.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.4%. This performance was generally in line with our expectations, but we did have an unfavorable comparison in sales due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week this past year. Our same-store sales would have been 68 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. Regionally, the markets West of the Mississippi outperformed the Eastern half of the U.S. The Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets were our lowest performance, but we see in our underperforming markets consistent performance on the two-year stack basis. During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 24 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand our international footprint opening two new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 35.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners' efforts to again deliver solid results for our first fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter, delivering 3.4% same-store sales growth, while strong was in line with our expectations. Over the last five quarters or so, we have made incremental operating expense investments in our business with an expectation that we would improve our competitive position and therefore, increase market share in both sectors accelerating our sales growth. We've been pleased with those investments, which were primarily in labor and technology. Our labor investments have resulted in reduced turnover of our most tenured knowledgeable customer-facing AutoZoners. And as we begin to deploy these new technologies, we expect them to enhance the customer and AutoZoners experience. In fiscal 2019, we shared well in advance that we would have accelerating SG&A expenses, which would lead to reduced EBIT growth for the fiscal year. We delivered on that commitment and slightly overperformed our expectations regarding EBIT in 2019. As we embark on fiscal 2020, we still have elements of our expense structure that are growing faster than historical rates. But our expectation is to have higher than historical sales growth like we have experienced in the last several quarters. For fiscal 2020, our expectation is the higher expected sales growth, will lead to EBIT growth rates above the last four quarters and approaching our more typical low to single \u2013 mid single-digit levels. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level, which we believe is in our line of sight. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must keep managing to our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that get in the way of making the customer experience better, both for do-it-yourself customer and the professional customers. We believe our industry's fundamentals will remain solid as we see positive year-over-year miles-driven statistics and the aging vehicle characteristics in our markets continued to encourage us about the New Year. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We believe our balanced earnings and cash-generating model allows us to deliver steady growth as our history suggests. We promised to remain committed to both executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I would like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately rewards our shareholders. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Yes. Thank you. Well, regarding the \u2013 where the growth is coming from, I'm even mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're seeing significant growth from mature customers who happen to be in mature programs. So most of the growth that we're seeing and most of the change in the growth that we're seeing is coming from existing customers that we've had, whether they were up and down the street or national account customers. We're just penetrating those customers much deeper than we were before. Regarding where we go from here. Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball. But I will tell you when we look back over this acceleration over the last five quarters, it has not been one thing. It has been due to several different initiatives that we've had in place and frankly, been in the works for several years, whether that's inventory assortment improvements, where that's getting our store managers and district managers involved, whether it's they building the reputation and the brand of the Duralast products that we sell, there has been a whole host of different things that we believe have contributed to this growth. We don't know what's going to happen in the future, but we do know that we have several other initiatives in front of us on the commercial front, particularly technology initiatives that we have not rolled out yet and we're excited about what the prospects of those initiatives will mean in the future. Yes. It's really hard to see it. Certainly, in certain product categories, we've seen the tariffs come in and they've been meaningful. But we have not taken the full cost impact because of our weighted average cost accounting model. So those costs come in over time as the inventory turns. So we have moved our retails up, as I said, in tranches. And when we've seen them go up, we have seen some elasticity of demand in certain categories, not a ton. At the end of the day, when we look at the impact of the inflation in the retails and the elasticity, we don't think net-net, it's having a significant impact on our business yet. But again, we still have a long way to go, because we haven't absorbed all those costs and then who knows where the tariffs go from here. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Michael, I would say, I had the same optimism I have had for about 25 years. I believe in the retail business. There \u2013 there's a lot of people, as I mentioned, that think that the retail business is going away that it's declining and the commercial business is rapidly growing. If you go back to our 1991 Annual Report, we are trying to dispute the myth that the retail business is declining. I'm trying to continue to dispel that myth. And the easiest way for me to do is talk about what has transpired over the last 25 quarters. 25 quarters, 21 of them have had positive same-store sales for AutoZone. Now I don't know what other people are experiencing. But I also mentioned enough, continued to mention that our retail business, in particular, it does not fluctuate that much quarter-to-quarter. It- our performance is in a pretty tight band. Now this quarter, we did particularly well, especially if you consider the shift, the calendar shift that impacted us, that would have been one of our stellar quarters. We're also going to have quarters that aren't as strong. That's just the nature of the business, but it trades from slightly down to up one or two points. And it's been doing that for as long as I've been in this business. I think you're going to continue to see it come from those smaller folks, it's what's happened overall. When I got in this business, there were about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Today, there's about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Now a lot more of them are in the hands of us and our close-in competitors. But there's still a whole lot out there that aren't by us. As I've said in the prepared remarks, we're going to continue to have elevated SG&A expenses. We've spent a lot of time working on some substantial new technology-oriented initiatives that frankly you haven't seen yet. And therefore, we haven't begun to expense them yet. They're showing up through the capital expense line. But because we haven't deployed them, we're not depreciating them. Those are coming. There's some on the DIY side, like I mentioned, the new POS system. We also have several on the commercial side that will be coming over the next six months or so. Thank you, too, Michael. Yes. What I'm trying to say is, remember, DIY does \u2013 it trades in a very tight band. We had a strong quarter this quarter. I don't know what's going to happen next quarter or the quarter after that. But overall, we believe in the long-term health of the DIY business. That's the message that I'm trying to make sure that we convey. I also want to put an exclamation point of something else that I said in the script. And that is that the second quarter is always very volatile. And part of it has to do with when the quarter ends, it ends right around Valentine's Day, which is when the season shift, when tax refunds begin to hit the marketplace. So I don't know what's going to happen in the second quarter. It's always volatile and we just want to make sure everybody realizes that. Yes. You too. I think it's accelerating as the entire business accelerates. The point that we're trying to make sure is that the biggest change that we've seen over the last six quarters or so has been our mature customer growth has changed significantly. Well, our confidence isn't going to determine whether we're successful or not unfortunately. I think, we certainly have a higher level of confidence, because we've done it for five quarters. I would say more importantly than that, we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in front of us. Now you said something I want to make sure that I'm not saying. I'm not saying our sales are going to accelerate from here in commercial, I don't know. But I feel like we will continue to outperform the industry by hopefully a substantial margin. That's 10% or 15%, I don't know, but I'm really excited about the initiatives that we have in front of us. And the \u2013 basically, the momentum that we're building in the marketplace from our inventory availability to the power of the Duralast brand to service that our customers are seeing from our AutoZoners just, as I've talked to customers, I see a whole different level of confidence that our customers have in us and our ability to service their needs. Thank you. Yes. I mean, we feel terrific about the Duralast brand, which is the largest brand \u2013 about the largest brand in aftermarket auto parts and we have over 50% of our sales come from our private label products. And the merchandising organization has done a terrific job of continuing to expand that brand across categories. And it continues to have a very high penetration and it's very well received by the customers, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side both. And so our expectation is that we'll continue to develop the brand, broaden it out, continue to find further opportunities in other categories where we can do further line extensions on Duralast and Valucraft and Duralast Gold brand all together. I think on some of those would be, some of the ones that are more dominated by national brands, for example, in oil and those kinds of categories that maybe they're already is an existing dominant national brand. But in many categories, we find that there continues to be significant opportunities from both Duralast and other private label products that we have. Yes. I mean, your math is right. And I would say that gross margin, we feel good about. I mean this quarter, we had a relatively flat, I think, was up 8 basis points on gross margin. So we feel pretty good about our ability to be able to continue to manage gross margin. Obviously, we get continued pressures from tariffs, et cetera. But the merchandising organization has done a great job of continuing to find opportunities to lower our costs. So we feel pretty good about the health of gross margin. And yes, on the SG&A front, we're going to continue to make the investments that we have made, many of which are focused on wages, as well as technology over the long haul. And so we expect there to be a little bit of pressure on that. But again, as Bill mentioned before, and we've mentioned, that our goal is to continue to grow EBIT on a low-to-mid single-digit over the long-term. Yep. Thank you. Yes. I would say on the megahub markets, I mean, we continue to see good performance out of them and not to dissect it too much. But it depends on how broad the market is and how close then the market is. And keep in mind that we only have 37 megahubs today. And frankly, the vast majority of them are relatively immature. So I think, we're still identifying what we believe to be the maturation curve from a sales perspective on megahubs. But we continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year improvements that the megahubs perform. Hubs have a little bit more maturity to them. But again, we're doing things that are helping drive the business overall adding more inventory, et cetera. So it becomes a little non-comparable when you look at some of the hubs today versus where they were like maybe five years ago in terms of what we've done inside the box to be able to drive sales. So the short answer is that, the maturation curve of both hubs and megahubs is still evolving. We continue to be very pleased with the investments that we're making and see that the improvements that we can drive and we will continue to invest in that category. Yes. I would say, I don't think that we're \u2013 I think the margin for commercial continues to remain healthy and there are obviously opportunities for us to improve margin on both sides of the business. But at the same time, keep in mind, that we're growing commercial at a rapid rate, but we're also making some investments and that's helping drive that. So over the long-term, I would expect margins to improve as some of those investments become more mature. But over the shorter-term, I would expect our margins to remain stable. Thank you. Sure. All great questions. I just keep going back to \u2013 it trades in such a tight band that it's really hard to say. We certainly think lower gas mileage is beneficial. We think miles-driven increases are beneficial. But there's so minuscule that they're just not big drivers of the business overall. We think the most important driver of what happens with the DIY business is what our AutoZoner do to provide great service to our customers. And I think we're doing a really, really good job of that right now. The morale of this organization of our teams in our stores, in particular, they know they're winning. They feel like they're winning. They feel good about it. And I think that that's translating into better service, which is translating into better performance. Yes, that's a great question. Most of those investments take time. And so there's a lot of things in the pipeline. So we might like to accelerate some of them, but there is a certain amount that we can digest as an organization. There's a certain pace at which we can develop those initiatives. So we will continue to work hard. We will continue to drive them where we can. But I expect it to be a little bit more steady state. Thank you. Yes. I think the second part of that is absolutely right, Greg, and it's going to depend on the categories. Certain categories turn faster or slower than other categories. So as we turn that inventory, the cost or the cost in our gross margin increase. And we're trying to manage that consistent with how we manage the retail increases. For the sole purpose of not shocking the system, we've had lots of different cost increases over the years for a variety of reasons, whether that's all based prices going up, lead, steel, whatever the case might be. But when it's 25%, that's a significant increase. And so we're trying to do that over three or four tranches, so not to shock the system and to try to provide the customer with as good value as we can for as long as we can. So far, I'm very pleased with how our merchants have managed those issues. What was the first part of your question, Greg.? We have filed some exceptions, don't know all the answers at this point in time. Some of them would impact us in a beneficial way if we were able to get them. Thank you, Greg. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. And we'd like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thank you very much."

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 fourth quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As I have said previously, throughout the pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the outstanding performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all time highs our AutoZoners continue to enthusiastically meet and embrace the challenge. As we say, they're going the extra mile for our customers and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. I also want to reiterate our highest priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners. Again, you are remarkable. This morning we will review our overall same store sales DIY versus the DIFM trends, sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies; we\u2019ll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the calendar year. Okay. Onto our sales results, our domestic same store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level, congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment. Additionally, we reached a new milestone in commercial sales surpassing $3 billion for the year finishing with over $3.3 billion in annual sales versus $2.7 billion in sales a year ago, an impressive 23% increase. We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reach $12,600 for the year up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success. I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter, while our DIY two year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our two year stack, same store sales. In commercial on a two year basis our sales were very consistent with last year's performance. Sorry, last quarter\u2019s performance. \\ Now let's focus on our sales cadence. This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first eight weeks of the quarter, our comp was 3.1%. In the last eight weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we like others who've benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales believe it is more insightful to look at a two year stack comp. For Q4 our two year comp was 26.0%. On a two year basis, our cadence for each four week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%. Our two year comp sales trends were remarkably strong and fairly consistent across the quarter. Regarding whether we experienced a noticeably warmer summer out west than in previous years, which helped our sales, but we experienced a milder summer in the Midwest and Northeast, which drove our sales to underperform the chain there. Overall weather impacts were neutral on our performance. Regarding the quarters traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4% while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay at home orders and closures of big box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year 2022. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern markets underperform, roughly 400 basis points in comp versus the remainder of the country. The data suggests that we have actually gained some share in these markets. However, we believe the milder summer weather was a large contributor to our sales comp results there. And across the country in retail, our share trends remain strong despite the reopening of big box retailer\u2019s automotive service departments that were closed this time last year. We have been very pleased that we have retained the roughly 10% market share we gained in our retail sales floor business last year. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety, and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2\u2019s call we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with a hundred dollar incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID 19, that's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our on-going PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first, while caring deeply for our AutoZoners. We are strongly encouraging our AutoZoners to get the vaccine as our culture and values of taking care of one another have been on display for the past 18 months. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 4.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $786 million and our EPS was $35.72 a share, 15.5% above last year's fourth quarter. Our domestic retail, same store sales were down slightly for the quarter while our commercial business remained remarkably strong. Commercial total sales grew approximately 21%. We averaged $74 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $14,400 in sales per program per week, which was easily an all-time record for us. The initiatives that we have in place are meaningfully helping our commercial business. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales for categories continue to outpace the hard part categories with categories like wipers, fluids and lighting all showing string. Our hard parts business was in line with our expectations. Ran roughly flat with last year. We were especially pleased as last year our hard parts business was very strong, especially in categories like batteries. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing in our space. This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories work their way through the system. We can see low single digit inflation in retails as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long it will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it is difficult to forecast near term sales. What I will say is this past quarter sales were better than we expected, and we exited the fiscal year with strong fundamentals in our business. For FY 2022, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our initiatives, both DIY and commercial have gained considerable share that we are maintaining. And we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth for the long term. We will earn our fair share and we hope to exceed expectations. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another great quarter. Our growth initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to maintain strong results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $4.8 billion up 8%. And for the total year, our total auto parts sales were $14.4 billion up 15.9%. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 21% for $1.2 billion and were up 31% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 24% of our total sales and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 18% as we average $74 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local counts all grew over 20% in the quarter. For the full year, our commercial sales grew 22.6% and 29% on a two year stack basis. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The disciplined investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 72 net new programs finishing with 5,179 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. And fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. We remain focused on delivering improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, making improvements in our assortment, maintaining competitive pricing, and staying committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past five quarters and position as well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our sales even further. Let me highlight one key initiative that is driving our performance and positioning in us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. And that's our mega hub strategy. Our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we are doubling down. We now have 58 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 20 more over the next 12 months. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly a hundred thousand SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as a fulfilment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift, to both our commercial and DIY business and we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even better sales results. With this effort, we are leveraging sophisticated analytics to help us expand our market reach, give us closer proximity to our customers and improve our product availability and delivery times. I will remind you that our current mega hub strategy envisions our expansion to a total of a 100 mega hubs to 110 mega hubs. However, as these assets continue to outperform our expectations, we would expect to expand significantly further. We are excited about this work and its ability to further accelerate our commercial growth. All of our efforts are building meaningful, competitive advantage and give us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down just 40 basis points, but up 23.4% on a two year stack. For the full year, the retail business was up 11.2% and 18.7% on a two year stack basis. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 300 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. We are excited about the initiatives that drove the tremendous sales and share growth and the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. We are winning in the marketplace and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers remains a key competitive advantage. As we exit fiscal 2021, I'm really pleased with the competitive positioning of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. The work we have done on improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing have led to tremendous results over the last two years. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the a quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish with 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52 on a constant currency basis. We saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economy stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant can contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish was 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economies stabilized we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 82 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investment in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 6.4%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range to our third quarter where we were down 118 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're beginning to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear overall, we have pricing power, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, we have been successful thus far at passing these higher cross through our retails. Overall the industry pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We should expect our margins in the first quarter to be down in a similar range to the fourth quarter. We are however focused on driving new customers to AutoZone and overtime, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total autoparts operating segments. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleverage 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses in the previous year. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was just over $1 billion up 2.6% versus prior year\u2019s quarter driven by strong top line growth. EBIT for fiscal year 2021 was just over $2.9 billion up 21.8% versus fiscal year 2020. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $58 million down 11.5% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $46 million to $48 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 22.3% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year it benefited 35 basis points. For the first quarter of 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23. 6% before any exemptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving in net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $786 million up 6.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $22 million was lower by 8.1% from last year's fourth quarter, the combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.72 up 15.5% over the prior years fourth quarter. Net income per share for fiscal year 2021 was $95.19 up a remarkable 32.3% reflecting our outstanding top line performance and lower share count. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash. Our operating cash results continued to benefit from strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up four tenths of a percent versus Q4 last year. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores, net inventory defined as merchandise inventories, less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $203,000 versus negative $104,000 last year and negative $167,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.6% versus last year's Q4 of 115.3%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.1 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $418 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and over $900 million of excess cash. For the full year, we bought back $3.4 billion of stock, or approximately 2.6 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carried over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 11% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach, where we expect to have powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong com sales, which drove a 6.1% increase in net income and a 15.5% increase in EPS. We are driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholder. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. Nice job. Also, congratulations on your one year AutoZone anniversary that you celebrated last week.\nJamere Jackson: Been fantastic.\nWilliam Rhodes: As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year. It is go the extra mile. And we will be hosting our annual national sales meeting here in Memphis next week to formally announce this theme. Being in person for the first time in two years, yes, we are going to host our AutoZoners who are vaccinated and wearing masks in person, and we are going to celebrate all they have accomplished over the past two years. I can't tell you how excited I am about next week. 2022 will again be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. In fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We will be announcing some significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 20 new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our ability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We'll open approximately 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressed. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of the pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have had on our sales. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our Autozoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning guys.\nWilliam Rhodes: Morning, Brett.\nJamere Jackson: Good morning, Brett.\nBret Jordan: On the share gain, could you give us a little bit more color I guess, as far as you know, where the share is coming from, is it warehouse distributors or from other two step distributors? And then, I guess are there particular categories that you're seeing relative outperformance and then I guess the cadence. You talked about maintaining the 10 points of share you'd picked up last year, is that slowed post COVID disruption. Are you still seeing the share gains continuing?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Terrific. So I'm going to bifurcate it and talk about retail and then come back and talk about commercial and then Jamere if you'll jump in and clarify anything if I miss it. Sorry. I had a mask on. First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark and plus batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close in competitors. So we have facts there. We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share. We haven't lost any of it. I mean, it's on the margin. It's slightly positive, slightly negative month to month. But we basically grew our share in that dataset by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that. And I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data, but we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look what's going on with our close in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing in these kinds of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples two or three times the market growth. Where all is it coming from? You probably has as good insights into that as we do, we look at the, the publicly available data. We see that we're, we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think that the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic, it's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last three years, as we implemented this latest round of strategy work, where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage, we're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our mega hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts. Jamere, do you have anything to add?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, I think a couple things stand out to me. One is that, as you mentioned, our business has been remarkably resilient and you combine that with a great execution that we have, and it's, it's striving exceptionally strong results. As we get further away from the lumpiness of the stimulus payments, I mean, it's clear that our share gains have been maintained. Bill talked about what we're seeing on the, on the sales floor market share. We've got great results and readouts from our loyalty programs that give us a lot of confidence. And our teams are doing a great job of executing. On the commercial side, we're continuing to see those significant share gains behind the business that are behind the initiatives that Bill talked about. And a couple of things really stand out to me, it's broad base. So it's national accounts and it's local accounts that are growing over 20%. We've seen the national snap back over the last year as car counts are up and staffing is improved and miles driven is improving. And our team is doing a fantastic job of executing with those customers. So we have a tremendous amount of confidence as we move forward into the year, and this is helping us create a faster growing business.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you. And Jamere, just a quick question on the accounts payable, I think that's a record at 129% of inventory. Is there a number or a range we should think about that being in going forward? Can it get it go higher than this?\nJamere Jackson: It's benefited over the last year, quite frankly, because our terms have been up significantly in an accelerated sales environment. We don't expect us to go much higher than, than where we currently are. But we're continuing to do all the things that we can to manage working capital both with our suppliers and with our partners and but I wouldn't expect it to go much higher just based on the tremendous amount of [turns] (ph) that we've had over the last year or so.\nBret Jordan: All right. Great. Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thank you, Bret.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I really had two questions. One you mentioned 200 stores in the Americas. Could you sort of walk us through the breakdown of what would be domestic and then those other markets and basically is that a, a run rate we should use going forward? If you look about, look at the opportunities and I have a follow-up.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. You can expect us to be in that zip code probably for the next couple of years or so. Roughly two thirds of that or more are going to be in and sort of the U.S. market if you will. We've, we've been looking at doing 150 to 170 stores, or so based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. You could see us do, 30 to 50 stores in Mexico, depending on the market conditions or so, and then, the remainder coming from Brazil. I think the good news for us is that we see tremendous market opportunities, both in the U.S. and in Mexico. And we talked about on our previous earnings call that we've been testing our market potential in Brazil for really the last decade or so and we think Brazil can be a very big market for us. So we've got great potential there. We've made some leadership team changes as well. So Tom Newbern is leading our international efforts going forward. Tom is a fantastic operator, has a ton of experience. And we look forward to that being a much bigger part of our story and our strategy as we go forward.\nGreg Melich: Great. And then the second question is linked to product availability and inflation. I think you mentioned that costs are going up, industries rationally passing it through. Was it fair to say the fourth quarter that inflation is maybe now running three to four in the top line, and how you think about that going forward?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. We're not seeing it at that level yet Greg. I think we will see it at that level. As you know, it takes some time for those price increases to work themselves through the system. And right now is, is a little bit different in that you're seeing direct product cost inflation, but the, the hyperinflation that we're seeing frankly, is in the transportation, or are not directly in all the product costs. And so we're having to be thoughtful about how do we ultimately pass those price increases or cost increases on through retail prices in both the domestic, both the retail and the commercial businesses. We think that you will see it more in the range you're talking about in Q1 and Q2, if not even a little bit higher, but that seems to be where we're headed.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And the product supply there hasn't been an issue in terms of getting products?\nWilliam Rhodes: No, there are absolutely significant issues in getting products. This we are running the lowest level of in stock that I can ever remember. It's, it's, 3% or 4% below where we normally run, it moves from one category to the other. This is the most difficult supply chain environment that I have ever seen, but I will tell you, our supply chain and merchants are working it so well. And so closely with our vendors and finding new suppliers along the way where we have to in the spot market or other areas that I think we are doing competitively. And when I say competitive, I'm talking about retail in general. I'm very proud of where we are, but very dissatisfied with it on a historical basis.\nGreg Melich: Got it. But competitively you feel you\u2019re in a better than typical spot in your space, just that is tight out there.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. And, and Greg, I think, we looked at our outperformance versus the market in both retail and commercial. The one piece that we really didn't highlight that I would highlight is AutoZone has been known as an execution machine for decades long before I got here. And I think that our core flawless execution has been a big contributor to our success over the last 18 months in these uncertain times.\nGreg Melich: Right. Well, congrats to you and the team.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning guys. So you spoke to a two year contracts over a while with some moderation in July, and then in August. Can you share what that trend looked like for the DIY versus the commercial side of the businesses or, or what drove that to moderation? And then related to that, as you think about August did given the easier comparing DIY, did that flip back the positive on a one-year basis?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So if you, if you look at the trends that we saw. I mean, we saw most of the moderation, obviously in our DIY business where our comps were significantly higher last year in the fourth quarter. But a couple things stand out to us. Again, as we move further and further away from the, the lumpiness is the stimulus payments that we talked about. Our business was, was pretty resilient. And so our business actually outperformed our expectations. Our commercial business has been just remarkably resilient as well. And, if you think about the commercial business, it's a lot stickier. The relationships that we built with our commercial customers is, is driving that business. And as we see the macro environment improve, and those are things like car counts, those are things like miles driven. The fact that our commercial customers are, are staffing have been able to, get their staffing levels back to where they need to be. That, that business has been very, very strong, as we, as we exited the quarter. As been our past practice, we typically don't you know, talk about what we see in the, in the early innings of, of the, the following quarter. But what I will say is that, as we, as we exited the fourth quarter we were very pleased with the trends that we were, we were seeing. And it gives us a lot of confidence about not only the first quarter, but the year in total.\nChristopher Horvers: And then so did DIY in that last four weeks that you spoke to, to DIY turned back to being positive?\nJamere Jackson: It was, it was, close to being flattish in that last four weeks or so. And again, when we get to the first quarter, we got much easier comps if you will. So that ought to give you some idea of what we're seeing in terms of trends moving into the first quarter.\nChristopher Horvers: It makes a lot of sense. So I guess on the pricing side so, so just to summarize there, it doesn't sound like you've seen any sort of fall out because of unemployment insurance expiring here in September. On the price side, you've invested in price and DIY to retain the share commercial to retain the share. How do you feel about where your price gaps are in the market currently in, in our things playing out the plan, i.e. there's not a necessarily a step up here from a price investment perspective that you feel you need to make to, in order to continue these great share trends?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. We believe the price investments are behind us. And, when we look at the moves that we made last year, we're going to start the anniversary, those going into this year. And as we said, the strategy is working. I mean, we, you see it in the numbers. We put on the board in terms of our DIY results and our commercial results and price has just been one element of the strategy. So all the other things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, and making sure that we have the right assortments, the investment that we've made in our products, the technology that we have on the commercial side, those things combined with competitive pricing have underpinned the growth story that you see here. So as we're in this inflationary environment, as Bill mentioned, we're being very disciplined. We're moving retails up on the commercial and in the DIY side, the industry has been very rational. But we're maintaining those competitive price differentials if you will, that have underpinned the share growth that we've seen over the last year or so. And that's what's really important. It's not an absolute price point of view is, if you will, but it's a relative price point. But as we have opportunities to take price up, we're certainly doing that.\nChristopher Horvers: Awesome. Have a great fall. Thanks very much.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, the industry has seen tremendous DIY growth over the last several quarters as consumers have largely been staying at home, have had more time on their hands to do projects on their cars. Why wouldn't the industry give a lot, a lot of that volume back as we get back to some sense of normalcy? And if that's the case, how can you manage its P&L to maintain the algorithm that the market to cut from the theme [ph] from models on.\nWilliam Rhodes: Terrific question, Michael, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jamere figure out the second part. On the sales side, your logic is very sound. If you look at the, our business overall is up roughly 25% versus pre pandemic levels. You've been watching this industry for a long time. I've been watching it longer and, it's generally a nice grower, but in the, the industry grows around 4% a year to grow 25% over 18 months is pretty phenomenal. I think, as we said, in our prepared comments, we expected our sales to step down some this summer that we saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really grow at an exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were. And we spent a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we, we do think that that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. I would encourage, we've spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores. And I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors. Go look at us versus other retailers. It is a very, in this interesting time, a very comfortable shopping environment, as comfortable as you can find, I believe. And so I think that customers have changed their shopping behaviors. They're not necessarily wanting to go to a big box store. I think there are some online retailers that deemphasized this category during the pandemic. And, fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year? We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to think about on a long-term historical basis. There have been before this period three times in my career where I've seen substantially above industry performance or industry performance above the norm. And that was in '93 and '94 01 and 02, 09, 10 and 11. All of those were coming out of very difficult economic environments. This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion. What was the interesting thing out of those most the best times that we've seen was following each one of those times, we didn't step back down as an industry to where the performance was before. Well, we have some step down as an industry maybe, but I don't expect it. And I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. It will step back a little bit, maybe, I don't know, cause this is unchartered waters, but I do think we have reintroduced ourselves to some customers. And I think our existing customers have started relying on us on a more frequent basis. And I believe many of those shopping habits will have changed forever. On the commercial side of the business, I think it's somewhat related to the pandemic. I think we're winning in a big way in the marketplace. I think we have changed our competitive position because of all the initiatives that we have. So I am, and I think we are quite bullish on the long term of the commercial business. Jamere, I'll let you talk about the P&L.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. From a P&L standpoint, here's the interesting thing for us. I mean, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in our business going forward. And if you recall, this is a business that has an algorithm that works at low to mid-single digit top line growth with high margins, that's fits off a lot of cash that we invest in our existing assets. We invest to grow our business and we return a lot of that to shareholders. Over the last couple of years or so we've had the opportunity to have outsize top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about, what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain. Bill talked about it in his, in his comments this morning. You've seen us invest in our, in our growth initiatives and we've had an outsize return to shareholders. So the algorithm works. It's worked for us in the past. It's worked for us through this environment where we've had accelerated sales, where we've done even more than we've done in the past. And we've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our growth prospects going forward. We're going to have tremendous financial firepower to grow this business and return cash to shareholders. And that quite frankly, is the AutoZone algorithm.\nMichael Lasser: Very helpful. And my follow-up question is you seem to suggest that your gross margin is starting to stabilize either because you have lacked some of the price investments that you've made, or there's other factors that, that will also contribute your gross margins on pace to be 52.7% this year which is down almost a hundred basis points from, from the peak. So are you suggesting that you can get back to the peak level or now that you you've we based it lower, this is the right way to think about the gross margin moving forward.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, I think we're not projecting that we're going to get back to any particular level, Michael. I think what we are saying is for the most part, the actions that we have taken in retail are done, many of those actions are behind us. We are very pleased with the competitive position that we have. We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that, to those competitors, that I\u2019ll call or a half a step away. In the commercial business, we took much more significant pricing actions. And they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial, but we finished those actions at the beginning of, of this past quarter call it in June. So, and those took some time to roll in. We started it with six markets and we went to 14 markets and we rolled it to the chain. So we're beginning to annualize the first smaller tranches of that. And we will annualize that in in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy, but as you can see in our commercial performance, we were winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in nine months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial. This was, this is what we wanted to do. And I think we're very pleased with how both have played out.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. The only thing that I'll add there is that our core capability inside the company, hasn't changed. The things that we've historically worked on in terms of assortment the awesome work that our, our merchants have done over the years, the things that we see in terms of the industries, pricing dynamics, those things haven't changed. So, the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time. I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined. As we've seen inflationary impacts hit the business, we've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've, I've often said that inflation is our friend in that, in that we're in that regard. So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. What we've done as Bill said is, we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business and nothing else about our businesses has changed. So all the great work that we've done in the past, we still have that capability going forward.\nMichael Lasser: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey everyone, a nice results. Maybe continuing on the gross margin thread maybe a comparer phrase what I heard from the last answer, which is, after these price investments we sort of that's the new base. And then from there, we could move into, the, where we were pre these price investments, which could have been up a little down a little sort of subject to the normal Jamere you said inflation, maybe mixed issues. But is there anything different about the go-forward once we laughed at these price investments and how you think the gross margin progresses? Because I think previously it's flattish maybe even up a little bit, is there anything wrong with that thought process in, in the out year?\nJamere Jackson: I think you said it better than I did Simeon. The only thing that I would add to it is, and you mentioned mix. If our commercial business continues to grow at a substantially accelerated rate versus our retail business, that'll provide incremental headwind.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Got it. Okay. That's fair. And then my follow-up, maybe it is it's for you Bill, because you're, you had the quote in the press release about aspiring or aiming for growth prospects in this current fiscal year. I assume you're mentioning, it's meant to be sales curious if it can be sales and EBIT or one could be without the other. And then, 2022 is a complex year because of what you're lapping. Is there any reason we shouldn't be back to algo by 2023? The only thing different I heard on the call was just additional capital investments, Bill that you mentioned in terms of investment, not sure if those hit the P&L any different, but if you can speak about, theoretically the, the out year progression.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. It's a, it's an interesting way out. I would've told you FY 2022 would have been the normalized year this time last year Simeon, but I just can't tell you what's going to happen in the environment. I mean, we're sitting here take, we'll get people with mask on. Jamere and I are taking our mask on and off to answer questions. I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we're done with them. And here we are with Delta variants, so I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is, is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level as I keep calling it to three decimal points. We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly on our people. So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. So that that'll be, over, over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend. But as we've said, all along our capital allocation strategy is one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have to have them perform at an optimal level. Two, invest in every growth aspect that we can, that will provide us a reasonable investor IRR, and then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders, that algorithm is going to stay the same. I hope in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as, as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY 2020 and 2021. I would have thought the same thing a year ago. I'm getting more and more confident that some of this is structural and some of this is permanent. What percentage your guess is as good as mine, because I've never seen a global pandemic before.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it, okay. Good luck. Thanks.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Simeon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final questions come from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. So I guess first, just a question on, on same skew inflation you mentioned that the retail business had about two percentage points of benefit there, was that consistent in the commercial channel as well?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, we saw similar inflation in both retail and commercial.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And as we think about just modeling the impact of cost increases, when did you really start to experience an acceleration of cost inflation? And as you set out that inventory, could there be a period where you're able to raise price on product sold that may have been acquired before costs really went up, which would enable some gross margin expansion, just as we think about modeling the cadence of the sell in versus sell out, how should we think about that?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, it's a good point. We started to see the cost inflation really at the tail end of the third quarter and pretty much all of the fourth quarter. And, our merchants have done a fantastic job of negotiating timing and also done a fantastic job of making sure that we got retails raised in a way that kept us competitive in the, in the marketplace. And the way that, costs actually ended up flowing through the system. You typically will have a little bit of margin accretion at least in the early endings, as you raise retails before all of the costs increases, make their way through. And to the extent that, we see price increases come, there are times where we actually move a little bit early. So those are things that can actually help you at least in the near term get a little bit of margin accretion and get out ahead of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint. And that's no different than, what we've done in the past.\nLiz Suzuki: Yep. Great. And just, sorry, one more follow up just on, on cost. Just as you think about rising wages, what's your average, entry-level minimum wage for at AutoZone and what are your expectations for how that could trend going into next year?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, we really haven't disclosed our average entry level wage, but what I, what I will tell you is for the last four years, I've been talking about, we've been operating in the toughest labor and market I've ever seen, and that our wage inflation has been significant. It has basically doubled the wage inflation during this period of time. It is very, very difficult to get new AutoZoners to join the company. I hear that from all of our retail peers. Fortunately in the last five weeks or so we, things have changed a little bit. I don't know if that's directly related to the change in enhanced unemployment or not. But we have seen a meaningful improvement in the ability to hire people in both the distribution centers and the stores over time. But we are dealing with the most significant inflation in the labor market that I've ever seen. And really don't anticipate that slowing down materially until the labor market frees up some.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, it's a, it's a macro issue. And certainly we're not immune to the market dynamics there. What else is that, we've done a very good job of sort of managing it. Our operations teams, both on the stores and the supply chain side are working really hard to manage turnover in this environment. We've been competitive in the marketplace. And then, when it, when it's all said and done, we do have pricing power that underpins our capability to price, to deal with the influx of the impacts of inflation, whether it's product costs or transportation costs, or what we're seeing in terms of labor. And that's, that's one of the things about this industry, the discipline in this industry that gives us a lot of confidence.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks very much.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted. As we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We'll continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2022 and beyond. We thank you for participating in today's call and have a great fall.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another great quarter. Our growth initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to maintain strong results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $4.8 billion up 8%. And for the total year, our total auto parts sales were $14.4 billion up 15.9%. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 21% for $1.2 billion and were up 31% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 24% of our total sales and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 18% as we average $74 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local counts all grew over 20% in the quarter. For the full year, our commercial sales grew 22.6% and 29% on a two year stack basis. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The disciplined investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 72 net new programs finishing with 5,179 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. And fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. We remain focused on delivering improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, making improvements in our assortment, maintaining competitive pricing, and staying committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past five quarters and position as well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our sales even further. Let me highlight one key initiative that is driving our performance and positioning in us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. And that's our mega hub strategy. Our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we are doubling down. We now have 58 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 20 more over the next 12 months. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly a hundred thousand SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as a fulfilment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift, to both our commercial and DIY business and we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even better sales results. With this effort, we are leveraging sophisticated analytics to help us expand our market reach, give us closer proximity to our customers and improve our product availability and delivery times. I will remind you that our current mega hub strategy envisions our expansion to a total of a 100 mega hubs to 110 mega hubs. However, as these assets continue to outperform our expectations, we would expect to expand significantly further. We are excited about this work and its ability to further accelerate our commercial growth. All of our efforts are building meaningful, competitive advantage and give us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down just 40 basis points, but up 23.4% on a two year stack. For the full year, the retail business was up 11.2% and 18.7% on a two year stack basis. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 300 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. We are excited about the initiatives that drove the tremendous sales and share growth and the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. We are winning in the marketplace and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers remains a key competitive advantage. As we exit fiscal 2021, I'm really pleased with the competitive positioning of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. The work we have done on improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing have led to tremendous results over the last two years. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the a quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish with 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52 on a constant currency basis. We saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economy stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant can contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish was 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economies stabilized we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 82 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investment in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 6.4%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range to our third quarter where we were down 118 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're beginning to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear overall, we have pricing power, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, we have been successful thus far at passing these higher cross through our retails. Overall the industry pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We should expect our margins in the first quarter to be down in a similar range to the fourth quarter. We are however focused on driving new customers to AutoZone and overtime, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total autoparts operating segments. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleverage 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses in the previous year. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was just over $1 billion up 2.6% versus prior year's quarter driven by strong top line growth. EBIT for fiscal year 2021 was just over $2.9 billion up 21.8% versus fiscal year 2020. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $58 million down 11.5% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $46 million to $48 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's first quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 22.3% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year it benefited 35 basis points. For the first quarter of 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23. 6% before any exemptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving in net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $786 million up 6.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $22 million was lower by 8.1% from last year's fourth quarter, the combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.72 up 15.5% over the prior years fourth quarter. Net income per share for fiscal year 2021 was $95.19 up a remarkable 32.3% reflecting our outstanding top line performance and lower share count. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash. Our operating cash results continued to benefit from strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up four tenths of a percent versus Q4 last year. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores, net inventory defined as merchandise inventories, less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $203,000 versus negative $104,000 last year and negative $167,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.6% versus last year's Q4 of 115.3%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.1 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $418 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and over $900 million of excess cash. For the full year, we bought back $3.4 billion of stock, or approximately 2.6 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carried over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 11% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach, where we expect to have powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong com sales, which drove a 6.1% increase in net income and a 15.5% increase in EPS. We are driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholder. Now I'll turn it back to Bill. Been fantastic. Good morning, Brett. Yes, I think a couple things stand out to me. One is that, as you mentioned, our business has been remarkably resilient and you combine that with a great execution that we have, and it's, it's striving exceptionally strong results. As we get further away from the lumpiness of the stimulus payments, I mean, it's clear that our share gains have been maintained. Bill talked about what we're seeing on the, on the sales floor market share. We've got great results and readouts from our loyalty programs that give us a lot of confidence. And our teams are doing a great job of executing. On the commercial side, we're continuing to see those significant share gains behind the business that are behind the initiatives that Bill talked about. And a couple of things really stand out to me, it's broad base. So it's national accounts and it's local accounts that are growing over 20%. We've seen the national snap back over the last year as car counts are up and staffing is improved and miles driven is improving. And our team is doing a fantastic job of executing with those customers. So we have a tremendous amount of confidence as we move forward into the year, and this is helping us create a faster growing business. It's benefited over the last year, quite frankly, because our terms have been up significantly in an accelerated sales environment. We don't expect us to go much higher than, than where we currently are. But we're continuing to do all the things that we can to manage working capital both with our suppliers and with our partners and but I wouldn't expect it to go much higher just based on the tremendous amount of [turns] (ph) that we've had over the last year or so. Thank you, Bret. Yes. You can expect us to be in that zip code probably for the next couple of years or so. Roughly two thirds of that or more are going to be in and sort of the U.S. market if you will. We've, we've been looking at doing 150 to 170 stores, or so based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. You could see us do, 30 to 50 stores in Mexico, depending on the market conditions or so, and then, the remainder coming from Brazil. I think the good news for us is that we see tremendous market opportunities, both in the U.S. and in Mexico. And we talked about on our previous earnings call that we've been testing our market potential in Brazil for really the last decade or so and we think Brazil can be a very big market for us. So we've got great potential there. We've made some leadership team changes as well. So Tom Newbern is leading our international efforts going forward. Tom is a fantastic operator, has a ton of experience. And we look forward to that being a much bigger part of our story and our strategy as we go forward. Yes. So if you, if you look at the trends that we saw. I mean, we saw most of the moderation, obviously in our DIY business where our comps were significantly higher last year in the fourth quarter. But a couple things stand out to us. Again, as we move further and further away from the, the lumpiness is the stimulus payments that we talked about. Our business was, was pretty resilient. And so our business actually outperformed our expectations. Our commercial business has been just remarkably resilient as well. And, if you think about the commercial business, it's a lot stickier. The relationships that we built with our commercial customers is, is driving that business. And as we see the macro environment improve, and those are things like car counts, those are things like miles driven. The fact that our commercial customers are, are staffing have been able to, get their staffing levels back to where they need to be. That, that business has been very, very strong, as we, as we exited the quarter. As been our past practice, we typically don't you know, talk about what we see in the, in the early innings of, of the, the following quarter. But what I will say is that, as we, as we exited the fourth quarter we were very pleased with the trends that we were, we were seeing. And it gives us a lot of confidence about not only the first quarter, but the year in total. It was, it was, close to being flattish in that last four weeks or so. And again, when we get to the first quarter, we got much easier comps if you will. So that ought to give you some idea of what we're seeing in terms of trends moving into the first quarter. Yes. We believe the price investments are behind us. And, when we look at the moves that we made last year, we're going to start the anniversary, those going into this year. And as we said, the strategy is working. I mean, we, you see it in the numbers. We put on the board in terms of our DIY results and our commercial results and price has just been one element of the strategy. So all the other things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, and making sure that we have the right assortments, the investment that we've made in our products, the technology that we have on the commercial side, those things combined with competitive pricing have underpinned the growth story that you see here. So as we're in this inflationary environment, as Bill mentioned, we're being very disciplined. We're moving retails up on the commercial and in the DIY side, the industry has been very rational. But we're maintaining those competitive price differentials if you will, that have underpinned the share growth that we've seen over the last year or so. And that's what's really important. It's not an absolute price point of view is, if you will, but it's a relative price point. But as we have opportunities to take price up, we're certainly doing that. Yes. From a P&L standpoint, here's the interesting thing for us. I mean, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in our business going forward. And if you recall, this is a business that has an algorithm that works at low to mid-single digit top line growth with high margins, that's fits off a lot of cash that we invest in our existing assets. We invest to grow our business and we return a lot of that to shareholders. Over the last couple of years or so we've had the opportunity to have outsize top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about, what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain. Bill talked about it in his, in his comments this morning. You've seen us invest in our, in our growth initiatives and we've had an outsize return to shareholders. So the algorithm works. It's worked for us in the past. It's worked for us through this environment where we've had accelerated sales, where we've done even more than we've done in the past. And we've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our growth prospects going forward. We're going to have tremendous financial firepower to grow this business and return cash to shareholders. And that quite frankly, is the AutoZone algorithm. Yes. The only thing that I'll add there is that our core capability inside the company, hasn't changed. The things that we've historically worked on in terms of assortment the awesome work that our, our merchants have done over the years, the things that we see in terms of the industries, pricing dynamics, those things haven't changed. So, the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time. I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined. As we've seen inflationary impacts hit the business, we've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've, I've often said that inflation is our friend in that, in that we're in that regard. So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. What we've done as Bill said is, we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business and nothing else about our businesses has changed. So all the great work that we've done in the past, we still have that capability going forward. I think you said it better than I did Simeon. The only thing that I would add to it is, and you mentioned mix. If our commercial business continues to grow at a substantially accelerated rate versus our retail business, that'll provide incremental headwind. Yes, we really haven't disclosed our average entry level wage, but what I, what I will tell you is for the last four years, I've been talking about, we've been operating in the toughest labor and market I've ever seen, and that our wage inflation has been significant. It has basically doubled the wage inflation during this period of time. It is very, very difficult to get new AutoZoners to join the company. I hear that from all of our retail peers. Fortunately in the last five weeks or so we, things have changed a little bit. I don't know if that's directly related to the change in enhanced unemployment or not. But we have seen a meaningful improvement in the ability to hire people in both the distribution centers and the stores over time. But we are dealing with the most significant inflation in the labor market that I've ever seen. And really don't anticipate that slowing down materially until the labor market frees up some."

            "name": "William Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 fourth quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As I have said previously, throughout the pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the outstanding performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all time highs our AutoZoners continue to enthusiastically meet and embrace the challenge. As we say, they're going the extra mile for our customers and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. I also want to reiterate our highest priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners. Again, you are remarkable. This morning we will review our overall same store sales DIY versus the DIFM trends, sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies; we'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the calendar year. Okay. Onto our sales results, our domestic same store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level, congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment. Additionally, we reached a new milestone in commercial sales surpassing $3 billion for the year finishing with over $3.3 billion in annual sales versus $2.7 billion in sales a year ago, an impressive 23% increase. We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reach $12,600 for the year up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success. I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter, while our DIY two year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our two year stack, same store sales. In commercial on a two year basis our sales were very consistent with last year's performance. Sorry, last quarter's performance. \\ Now let's focus on our sales cadence. This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first eight weeks of the quarter, our comp was 3.1%. In the last eight weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we like others who've benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales believe it is more insightful to look at a two year stack comp. For Q4 our two year comp was 26.0%. On a two year basis, our cadence for each four week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%. Our two year comp sales trends were remarkably strong and fairly consistent across the quarter. Regarding whether we experienced a noticeably warmer summer out west than in previous years, which helped our sales, but we experienced a milder summer in the Midwest and Northeast, which drove our sales to underperform the chain there. Overall weather impacts were neutral on our performance. Regarding the quarters traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4% while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay at home orders and closures of big box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year 2022. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern markets underperform, roughly 400 basis points in comp versus the remainder of the country. The data suggests that we have actually gained some share in these markets. However, we believe the milder summer weather was a large contributor to our sales comp results there. And across the country in retail, our share trends remain strong despite the reopening of big box retailer's automotive service departments that were closed this time last year. We have been very pleased that we have retained the roughly 10% market share we gained in our retail sales floor business last year. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety, and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2's call we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with a hundred dollar incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID 19, that's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our on-going PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first, while caring deeply for our AutoZoners. We are strongly encouraging our AutoZoners to get the vaccine as our culture and values of taking care of one another have been on display for the past 18 months. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 4.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $786 million and our EPS was $35.72 a share, 15.5% above last year's fourth quarter. Our domestic retail, same store sales were down slightly for the quarter while our commercial business remained remarkably strong. Commercial total sales grew approximately 21%. We averaged $74 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $14,400 in sales per program per week, which was easily an all-time record for us. The initiatives that we have in place are meaningfully helping our commercial business. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales for categories continue to outpace the hard part categories with categories like wipers, fluids and lighting all showing string. Our hard parts business was in line with our expectations. Ran roughly flat with last year. We were especially pleased as last year our hard parts business was very strong, especially in categories like batteries. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing in our space. This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories work their way through the system. We can see low single digit inflation in retails as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long it will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it is difficult to forecast near term sales. What I will say is this past quarter sales were better than we expected, and we exited the fiscal year with strong fundamentals in our business. For FY 2022, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our initiatives, both DIY and commercial have gained considerable share that we are maintaining. And we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth for the long term. We will earn our fair share and we hope to exceed expectations. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. Nice job. Also, congratulations on your one year AutoZone anniversary that you celebrated last week. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year. It is go the extra mile. And we will be hosting our annual national sales meeting here in Memphis next week to formally announce this theme. Being in person for the first time in two years, yes, we are going to host our AutoZoners who are vaccinated and wearing masks in person, and we are going to celebrate all they have accomplished over the past two years. I can't tell you how excited I am about next week. 2022 will again be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. In fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We will be announcing some significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 20 new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our ability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We'll open approximately 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressed. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of the pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have had on our sales. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our Autozoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Morning, Brett. Yes. Terrific. So I'm going to bifurcate it and talk about retail and then come back and talk about commercial and then Jamere if you'll jump in and clarify anything if I miss it. Sorry. I had a mask on. First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark and plus batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close in competitors. So we have facts there. We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share. We haven't lost any of it. I mean, it's on the margin. It's slightly positive, slightly negative month to month. But we basically grew our share in that dataset by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that. And I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data, but we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look what's going on with our close in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing in these kinds of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples two or three times the market growth. Where all is it coming from? You probably has as good insights into that as we do, we look at the, the publicly available data. We see that we're, we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think that the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic, it's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last three years, as we implemented this latest round of strategy work, where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage, we're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our mega hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts. Jamere, do you have anything to add? Yes. We're not seeing it at that level yet Greg. I think we will see it at that level. As you know, it takes some time for those price increases to work themselves through the system. And right now is, is a little bit different in that you're seeing direct product cost inflation, but the, the hyperinflation that we're seeing frankly, is in the transportation, or are not directly in all the product costs. And so we're having to be thoughtful about how do we ultimately pass those price increases or cost increases on through retail prices in both the domestic, both the retail and the commercial businesses. We think that you will see it more in the range you're talking about in Q1 and Q2, if not even a little bit higher, but that seems to be where we're headed. No, there are absolutely significant issues in getting products. This we are running the lowest level of in stock that I can ever remember. It's, it's, 3% or 4% below where we normally run, it moves from one category to the other. This is the most difficult supply chain environment that I have ever seen, but I will tell you, our supply chain and merchants are working it so well. And so closely with our vendors and finding new suppliers along the way where we have to in the spot market or other areas that I think we are doing competitively. And when I say competitive, I'm talking about retail in general. I'm very proud of where we are, but very dissatisfied with it on a historical basis. Yes. And, and Greg, I think, we looked at our outperformance versus the market in both retail and commercial. The one piece that we really didn't highlight that I would highlight is AutoZone has been known as an execution machine for decades long before I got here. And I think that our core flawless execution has been a big contributor to our success over the last 18 months in these uncertain times. Thank you very much. Thank you. Terrific question, Michael, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jamere figure out the second part. On the sales side, your logic is very sound. If you look at the, our business overall is up roughly 25% versus pre pandemic levels. You've been watching this industry for a long time. I've been watching it longer and, it's generally a nice grower, but in the, the industry grows around 4% a year to grow 25% over 18 months is pretty phenomenal. I think, as we said, in our prepared comments, we expected our sales to step down some this summer that we saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really grow at an exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were. And we spent a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we, we do think that that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. I would encourage, we've spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores. And I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors. Go look at us versus other retailers. It is a very, in this interesting time, a very comfortable shopping environment, as comfortable as you can find, I believe. And so I think that customers have changed their shopping behaviors. They're not necessarily wanting to go to a big box store. I think there are some online retailers that deemphasized this category during the pandemic. And, fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year? We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to think about on a long-term historical basis. There have been before this period three times in my career where I've seen substantially above industry performance or industry performance above the norm. And that was in '93 and '94 01 and 02, 09, 10 and 11. All of those were coming out of very difficult economic environments. This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion. What was the interesting thing out of those most the best times that we've seen was following each one of those times, we didn't step back down as an industry to where the performance was before. Well, we have some step down as an industry maybe, but I don't expect it. And I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. It will step back a little bit, maybe, I don't know, cause this is unchartered waters, but I do think we have reintroduced ourselves to some customers. And I think our existing customers have started relying on us on a more frequent basis. And I believe many of those shopping habits will have changed forever. On the commercial side of the business, I think it's somewhat related to the pandemic. I think we're winning in a big way in the marketplace. I think we have changed our competitive position because of all the initiatives that we have. So I am, and I think we are quite bullish on the long term of the commercial business. Jamere, I'll let you talk about the P&L. Yes, I think we're not projecting that we're going to get back to any particular level, Michael. I think what we are saying is for the most part, the actions that we have taken in retail are done, many of those actions are behind us. We are very pleased with the competitive position that we have. We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that, to those competitors, that I'll call or a half a step away. In the commercial business, we took much more significant pricing actions. And they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial, but we finished those actions at the beginning of, of this past quarter call it in June. So, and those took some time to roll in. We started it with six markets and we went to 14 markets and we rolled it to the chain. So we're beginning to annualize the first smaller tranches of that. And we will annualize that in in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy, but as you can see in our commercial performance, we were winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in nine months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial. This was, this is what we wanted to do. And I think we're very pleased with how both have played out. Thank you. Yes. It's a, it's an interesting way out. I would've told you FY 2022 would have been the normalized year this time last year Simeon, but I just can't tell you what's going to happen in the environment. I mean, we're sitting here take, we'll get people with mask on. Jamere and I are taking our mask on and off to answer questions. I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we're done with them. And here we are with Delta variants, so I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is, is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level as I keep calling it to three decimal points. We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly on our people. So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. So that that'll be, over, over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend. But as we've said, all along our capital allocation strategy is one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have to have them perform at an optimal level. Two, invest in every growth aspect that we can, that will provide us a reasonable investor IRR, and then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders, that algorithm is going to stay the same. I hope in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as, as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY 2020 and 2021. I would have thought the same thing a year ago. I'm getting more and more confident that some of this is structural and some of this is permanent. What percentage your guess is as good as mine, because I've never seen a global pandemic before. Thank you, Simeon. Yes, we saw similar inflation in both retail and commercial. Yes, it's a good point. We started to see the cost inflation really at the tail end of the third quarter and pretty much all of the fourth quarter. And, our merchants have done a fantastic job of negotiating timing and also done a fantastic job of making sure that we got retails raised in a way that kept us competitive in the, in the marketplace. And the way that, costs actually ended up flowing through the system. You typically will have a little bit of margin accretion at least in the early endings, as you raise retails before all of the costs increases, make their way through. And to the extent that, we see price increases come, there are times where we actually move a little bit early. So those are things that can actually help you at least in the near term get a little bit of margin accretion and get out ahead of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint. And that's no different than, what we've done in the past. Yes, it's a, it's a macro issue. And certainly we're not immune to the market dynamics there. What else is that, we've done a very good job of sort of managing it. Our operations teams, both on the stores and the supply chain side are working really hard to manage turnover in this environment. We've been competitive in the marketplace. And then, when it, when it's all said and done, we do have pricing power that underpins our capability to price, to deal with the influx of the impacts of inflation, whether it's product costs or transportation costs, or what we're seeing in terms of labor. And that's, that's one of the things about this industry, the discipline in this industry that gives us a lot of confidence. Thank you. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted. As we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We'll continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2022 and beyond. We thank you for participating in today's call and have a great fall."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Bill Rhodes, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin. \nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we've had - have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they've taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all.  I also want to reiterate, our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners, again.  Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercials growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses, but especially for commercial.  We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all-time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing four quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes.  Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter, we stripped -- this quarter stretch from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first four weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the Central and Southeastern states.  Sales picked up for the next four weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final four weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these four weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those four weeks, we averaged a 14% comp, with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. We continue to maintain solid growth rates post-stimulus. For Q3, our two-year comp was 27.9%. On a two-year stack basis, the first four weeks were up 17.9%, the next four weeks were up an impressive 49.9%, and the last four weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter, with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate, as the reintroduction of Federal Stimulus Payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic.  During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer basis, we saw the majority of the country performed consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others; no, not this quarter.  These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and the DIFM. And we believe that winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall.  And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The shared data we have available for the first eight weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter\u2019s call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment, as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts.  We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management teams\u2019 commitment to doing what is right and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales and sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us.  However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year. And we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical.  Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history. As last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July, and we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY, as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. Now, let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter, our net income was $596 million, and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter.  Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion dollar market. And we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools antifreeze, small repair and floormats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. And our hard parts business comp in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items.  We believe the strengthening of our hard parts businesses due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories, such as accessories and batteries, notably brakes and rotors. While still slightly below our average growth had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather.  As we expect, our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. We believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses positioned us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry.  In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects.  Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 31.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales. And our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2% as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales.  Our growth was broad based as national accounts and local and regional accounts, both grew over 40% in the quarter. Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I've said previously, we're focused on building a faster growing business with discipline investments in pricing service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity, as we are significantly under penetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores. And we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts.  This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs finishing with 5107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers.  Our strategy is working as we continue to grow share this past quarter. We're confident that we can continue to gain shear as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, make improvements in our assortment, maintain competitive pricing, and stay committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past four quarters and position as well in the marketplace.  As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our mega hub strategy is improving our parts availability, and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened two more mega hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations. And we expect to open between four and seven more mega hubs by the end of the fiscal year.  As you might recall from last quarters conference call, we raised our near-term target of build out of mega hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega hubs help us expand coverage and say yes, we have it more frequently. Expanding our mega hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business.  Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. Third, we're committed to being price competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results.  We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our plans to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business.  On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share, and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad based across regions and categories.  In the quarter we delivered double digit comps and eight of the 12 weeks. And all 12 weeks had positive comps, despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share as measured by NPD grew nearly two points for the first eight weeks of the quarter. And we saw double digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter.  We also who share in April, despite the tremendous growth last year signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas.  First, the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes. And our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear we are winning in the marketplace and execution of our AutoZoners, we're taking care of our customers is a key competitive advantage.  Second, the assortment work and mega hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability leading to a meaningful lift in sales. Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts. Buy online pick up in-store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home which were up against significantly this quarter have helped us meet customers when where and how they want to shop.  We're particularly pleased with buy online pick up in-store the fastest growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure play competitors.  Fourth, and similar to our commercial approach, we're using discipline and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively price. This is a data-rich environment and our data-driven approach tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage.  We've tested our approach in key categories and markets and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth albeit it's slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working. And we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lapped the accelerated sales growth that we've seen over the past four quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results.  Now, let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter we open seven new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores, and one new store in Brazil to finish with 47.  On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future.  I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business in our investment in our pricing initiatives.  As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter. We're also making discipline pricing investments to drive top line-growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpace the remaining market this quarter.  Our approach is discipline and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determine which actions move the sales and gross profit dollar performance in the right direction. We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product care categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry\u2019s pricing remains rational, and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business. And as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter.  We will continue to drive new customers and overtime grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster and historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses, compared to last year third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Even for the quarter was $804 million or 63% versus the prior year quarter, or EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top-line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier.  Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million down 5% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million and last year's fourth quarter. Our adjusted debt level metric finished a quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving the tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable, and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million up 73.9% versus last year third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lowered by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed.  And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year, and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year driven by new stores.  Net inventory is defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately $21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter-end we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares.  The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carry over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first three quarters of the year. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year.  Our business remains remarkably strong. And this will enable us to invest in our existing assets grow our business, and as I emphasized earlier, return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach.  So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.  Our strategy is working. And I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill. \nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times. Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this timeframe. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, but doing so in a very safe manner.  At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter, 30 years after going public is just amazing. But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment.  We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn, but we will be deliberate.  We understand the value of the capital invested as our capital as our investors\u2019 capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. But we must keep focused and continue to deliver. There are no layups, we must continue to innovate.  While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds.  Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial businesses still in the very early innings of the maturation process.  It is an honor to have reported this morning, that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing four quarter basis. But we hope, and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season. But we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company.  Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. \nBret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. \nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning, Bret. \nJamere Jackson : Good morning, Bret. \nBret Jordan : In your prepared remarks, you talked about the improvement in quality of the Duralast parts, obviously, started as a driver of [ph] the commercial traction. Could you talk about how maybe higher input costs, obviously, buying a higher value part is impacting margins versus the price investments?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yeah, Jamere talked about the fact that we're beginning to see some pretty significant inflation on certain product categories. I don't think that that's been a big driver of our performance in Q3, but it is something that we are very mindful of as we move into Q4. And frankly, we have in the past, some of those costs along to our customers, just like we've done for the last 40 years. \nBret Jordan : Okay. And I guess on the price investment conversation, I guess, when you think about the DIY business versus the commercial, could you maybe just sort of bucket it for us? Do you see more aggressive price investment on one side versus the other? And then within commercial, are you seeing more competition in national accounts versus regional? I guess, where do you see that, I guess, the heat zones of price competition?\nJamere Jackson : Yeah, what I'll say in general, is that we've been very disciplined about the investments that we've been making in pricing. As I mentioned, this is a very data-rich environment. We're using data-driven through tools. We're using artificial intelligence and data science to help us figure out exactly where to price, which categories to price, which reasons to price. So it's a very dynamic environment in that regard. We're fortunate that we don't have to peanut butter spread this across the chain, if you will. So, what we're doing is very surgical and very strategic. What I'll say in terms of the competitive responses that the industry remains very rational. We're seeing rational pricing across the industry and the response. To that extent, it's been pretty muted. So our strategy is working. Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher-margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value.  And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that, all the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just one element of it. And I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned, the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand, including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold, those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with, it's helping us lower our delivery times, is a significant impact on the business.  The work that we're doing around mega hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth.  And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market.\nBret Jordan : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nSimeon Gutman : Hey, everyone, good morning. I'm going to stick on the pricing topic. My first question is, did you get more aggressive in this quarter? It looks like the margin compression got a little worse and there were some other factors. But \u2013 and if you did, why now? And just to be clear, are these price investments more on the DIY side or the DIFM?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Simeon, good morning, and thank you for the question. Clearly, they\u2019re on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on two different spectrums of the business.  One on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments, and then two on very slow moving hard to find powerful - maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is, when you can walk in the store and get the immediate product availability.  The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today and we've done that work. And it's all in place. And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive, because we took prices to a different level. We continue to roll out the pricing initiatives that we're working. We originally started with six regions, then we went to 14 regions.  As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. We don't plan on having around two of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also, more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different.  When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition that gets other sectors of the industry.\nSimeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. And I guess the follow-up is in the same -- I guess, the same vein. So it seems like you're having success with this strategy, which on the one hand, is showing that there is some elasticity of demand. And now we're going to be going through a bit -- some inflation, and you're already starting to see it. And I would think in theory, the industry would try to pass that along. Is there any sort of disconnect? Or how should we think about inability to pass along pricing if the customer is showing elasticity, if that makes any sense? And might you lean into pricing more next year? Is this working and you have inflation? Yeah. \nWilliam Rhodes: Yeah. I would say it's the elasticity of demand for us, but it's not driving elasticity of demand for the industry. I think in some respects, it's improved our competitive position, not against our in-channel competitors, but against other competitors and that's proven to be successful.  As we think about an inflationary environment, I know AutoZone will make sure that we pass those costs along to our consumers, just like we always have. And I don't think that that'll be any different than normal.\nSimeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Good luck. \nWilliam Rhodes: All right. Thank you, Simeon. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. \nChristopher Horvers : Thanks, and good morning. So I'll stick to the pricing side too for my first question. It seems like the transition here is the rollout of the commercial side. But you're also going to be, you're going to start lapping through the DIY price investment. So, as we think about 3Q and 4Q would seem like the peak gross margin pressure is now. And then that starts to moderate as we lap through the DIY side of the business price investments. Is that fair? \nJamere Jackson : Yeah, that's the right cadence to think about. One of the things that Bill mentioned is that, we don't have around to plan here. So, as we rolled the price investments through the entire chain, and all the categories that we're going to roll it through, you'll start to see us anniversary this in the back half of next year.  So -- and again, we're pleased with the execution of those initiatives. Again, it's one element of the strategy, if you will. It certainly gets a lot of a lot of attention. But we would not be in a position to even be talking about making pricing investments if we weren't executing so well, on all of the other elements of the strategy. And when I think about, again, the work that we've done on assortment, I think about the work that we're doing to lean in the technology. Those things have been the foundation or the enablers for us to then focus on this element of being competitively priced.  And, I said it a couple of times in my prepared comments about having the best merchandise at the right price. That combined with the other things that we're working on, give us a meaningful competitive advantage. And it's why we're so bullish about being a faster growing business in the future.\nChristopher Horvers : Yes. And that leads to my follow up. If you look back versus two years ago to try to neutralize versus what happened last year, your gross margins down 120, your operating margin is up more than 200 basis points, given the sheer gains and the sales leverage that you're driving. So you'll have continued gross margin headwinds. But as you think about the operating margin line into next fiscal year, is it fair to think that the operating margin can at least be flat if not better, as we look out, given the increased scale, and share gains that you've driven? \nJamere Jackson : Well, we've done a couple of things in this environment where we've had accelerated sales. Number one, we've had outstanding leverage on the SG&A line, which quite frankly served as a little bit of a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making in gross margin. And we do have the ability as we move forward to continue to price in a very disciplined way, when we're in an environment where there's inflation. Quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price. And we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories.  But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. So, going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars, that's going to give us tremendously powerful free cash flow.  And you can tweak margins by a point or a point and a half, doesn't change the underlying story here, which is this is a business that is generating a tremendous amount of cash. And we're putting that to work by investing in our existing assets. We're investing in our growth initiatives, and we're returning meaningful amounts of cash to investors in a meaningful way. That portion of the AutoZone model does not change even with all the things that we've talked about this morning in terms of investments.\nChristopher Horvers : Understood, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, how are you? I got to be consistent and ask about price investment. The bottom line is still -- is it worth it? And to help frame this question, if you just take a 1% -- 1% investment in your price in this most recent quarter, what that means is $35 million of sales that you're investing back into price to get something more than that.  In any given quarter prior to the pandemic, AutoZone would regularly see an average of $70 million in year-over-year sales increases. So now you're having to invest almost half that amount to drive these share gains. How do you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors? And one of the fundamental underpinnings of why investors allocate capital to the state is because of the margin stability. And this strategy could call into question that margin stability?\nWilliam Rhodes: I understand your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right. And that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time as clearly there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about -- picking up the gross profit dollars.  But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this, we've tested it extensively for over a year. Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial or our closest competitors may follow us. They may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition.  It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close in competitors. We feel like we're doing exceptionally well with that. I think also want to go back to what Jamere said.This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over three years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website all making us much easier to do business with, and substantially lowering our delivery times. We've continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. People used to think that that was a headwind. Now people understand that as a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out hubs and mega hubs, where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products.  So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years, because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics, but the overall operating margin characteristics.  And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough through. Remember in 2005, when I came into this role, and we made an SG&A investment. Everybody said, Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A, or the beginning of the operating margins going from 17.5 down to 12. Well, what happened? Over time, we found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that'll happen from here. But these are very marginal investments, to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels.\nMichael Lasser : Okay. Got it. I think market can get a little bit more comfort, if you did a fix -- or very clear about a timeframe associated with it? It seems like what you're suggesting before, but we're going to do this for another four quarters, while it's going to be a bit more intense over the next cup or two. It should start after that so is it fair?  And then just a quick follow up for Jamere, how will a higher current commercial mix in the business in fiscal \u201822 impact the gross margin so we can frame out these two pieces as we try and model the business moving forward? Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Michael, before I turn that second part over to Jamere, I want to hit your earlier part. I was very clear, in my comment a few minutes ago, that as of now we have rolled out this commercial pricing initiative across the vast majority of the chain. And as Jamere said there is no Act 2 under development or under consideration.  So as we annualize this time next year, we'll be annualizing those investments. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson : Yeah. So in terms of our commercial mix, we're very bullish about our commercial business. And, as we talk pretty extensively about today, and last quarter, we're investing in a disciplined way in our commercial business. This past quarter, our national accounts and our regional and local accounts both grew over 40%. We are pleased to see the Nationals actually snap back car counts are up, staffing has improved, miles driven is improving.  And we're under penetrated. We think we're roughly a four to five share in a $75 billion category. So there's a tremendous opportunity to create a faster growing business here. And as we execute on this growth playbook and see significant share gains, we will likely be in a position where we see a little bit of a mixed drag from commercial on the overall margins. And that's going to be perfectly okay. This will be a faster growing and still high margin business as we move forward.  And, as we see that growth materialize, we'll be very transparent about what our expectations are.\nMichael Lasser : Okay, thank you very much, and good luck. \nWilliam Rhodes: Thanks. \nJamere Jackson : Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nScot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Love to ask a pricing investment question, but I just couldn't do that to you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thanks, Scot. \nScot Ciccarelli : You're welcome. You talked about seeing product inflation starting to ramp. Can you talk about the potential impact on the cost side of the ledger, particularly on wages, given the current employment environment?\nJamere Jackson : Yeah, so we're seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing, some higher transportation costs. But as I said before, the industry pricing is rational. And this has always been an industry that's price to recover those inflationary impacts. And we're pricing accordingly in this environment as well.  Transportation costs in particular, we've had some contracted rates that are below the spot market. So this is protected us to some extent. But we'll see more of those as we move forward.  From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than, what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage.  Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams, and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment. And as -- we also believe that from a macro standpoint, as some of the enhanced unemployment benefits start to ease and be retracted. We think that will sort of unstick the labor market to a certain extent.  But all the efforts that we're doing inside of our company to attract talent, is quite frankly, one of the reasons that we've been able to put up the kind of numbers that we put up in both our DIY and our commercial business.\nScot Ciccarelli : And Jamere, just as a follow up, is there any kind of estimate regarding what might happen to labor costs, if we actually did eventually get a federal mandated $15 an hour minimum?\nJamere Jackson : Well, I think a couple of things will potentially happen there. One is that, we'll see labor costs start to go up in different environments. We're already seeing some markets where labor costs have gone up in that zip code. And what you have to be able to do is, more importantly, you have to be able to price accordingly, so that you don't have the margin and profitability drags.  And so when I think about the impacts of inflation, it isn't just what we're seeing in product costs, or transportation costs, but labor is a part of that equation. And we'll be disciplined enough to price accordingly, in that environment as well. \nWilliam Rhodes: Let me jump in there. As you know, Scot, we've been dealing with accelerated labor inflation for some time for five years. And we have many markets where we're already at $15 or above. I was recently in Seattle. Our minimum wage in Seattle is $16.70. And we are figuring out a way to make sure that we manage through that. And part of that is our pricing has to be different when we have that kind of change in our labor component of our cost structure.\nScot Ciccarelli : Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Scot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nZach Fadem : Hey, good morning, guys. As we look back over the past year, your business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate despite a double-digit decline in miles driven. And now that miles driven starting to recover and return to growth. Do you expect this dynamic to be a tailwind for your business, despite the tougher compares? Or are there any other puts and tastes that we should keep in mind? \nWilliam Rhodes: Clearly, we said over a long, long period of time that miles driven is a good indicator of what -- of how our business is going to perform. However, we've also said and we said this back in the Great Recession, that in certain times, it's not a good predictor of what happens in our business.  Clearly, if you just straight line what happens to miles driven, you would never forecast what happened to us over the last year. Because miles driven were down significantly, but there was a new element called Federal Stimulus. And we were talking this morning that, a family of four, over the last four years or last four quarters has picked up over $10,000 in Federal Stimulus. That does not count, unemployed -- Enhanced Unemployment Benefits, that is just the stimulus.  For our customer, that's a tremendous amount of money. And many of those customers turn to their automobiles and enhanced them repaired them or whatever the case may be. Clearly, as miles driven return, there will be some small tailwind. But I don't think that it will be nearly enough to offset the headwind that will come from us lapping those tremendous amounts of economic stimulus that were in the environment.\nZach Fadem : Got it. And Is it possible to break out the makeup of the commercial growth across new customers versus existing customers or nationals versus independents? And then, when you think about your average weekly commercial sales in that mid-13,000 range, was that relatively stable through the quarter? And is it fair to call that a new run-rate for the business?\nWilliam Rhodes: We're calling it that internally. We're putting the pressure on the team, we got to keep that. I think that there's some level of stimulus. It's been in our commercial performance as well, but not nearly to the extent that it has helped accelerate the DIY business.  So we have big expectations to continue to grow commercial at fairly robust rates going forward. Clearly, the DIY piece will be more challenged as we head into Q4, and really frankly the next 12 months. But commercial we think, is a much stickier business. Yes, we picked up new customers. More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business.  As Jamere said, as far as the trade-off between the up and down the street customer or the national account customer. Before this quarter, our up and down the street business was performing much better than our national account business. This quarter, the national account business was generally in line with our up and down the street business. And as we talked to those leaders, their businesses have improved along the same lines.\nZach Fadem : Got it. Appreciate the time today. \nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.\nKaty Hallberg: Hi, everyone, this is Katy Hallberg on for Mike Baker. Just want to say great job on the quarter. And I know you guys touched on recently about how stimulus might have impacted the commercial sales versus DIY. But I was kind of curious about within that 44% growth and commercial, how much would you attribute to the mega hubs? So kind of, tacking on the stimulus and the pricing initiative, curious about the mega hub impact? \nJamere Jackson : Yeah, so parts availability is a big piece of the story that we have in the commercial market today. When we put a mega hub in a market, two things happen. Number one, we see a lift in sales in the four walls, if you will of the mega hub. But it also gives us an opportunity as we're selling to commercial accounts.  It gives us an opportunity to tell the commercial accounts in that area, if you will, that we have parts available, significantly more parts available than we would otherwise. And that gives us a meaningful lift and sale.  So a big piece of that strategy that we've talked about is improving that assortment, putting mega hubs in the marketplace, signaling to the market, that we have more parts available in the marketplace. And then taking advantage of that that opportunity. We've talked about lots of things that drive our commercial business. But, in the top one or two is parts availability. If we have the parts, if we can get them there in a reasonable amount of time, they're competitively priced. We're easy to do business with that gives us a tremendous tailwind for this business. And that's what we're excited about.\nKaty Hallberg: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just sort of a follow up. And this is a more broad question. Where are you guys seeing the most opportunity for your share gains? I mean, does it seem like the industry is sort of through the thick of store closures as we're kind of approaching? What could be the end of the pandemic? And just kind of curious about what you're seeing in the industry? Thank you. \nWilliam Rhodes: Yeah, I think the share gains that we got because of store closures were really over around May of last year. But we've continued to grow share gains, as consumer behaviors have changed.  Just think about not -- whether or not a store is open. But think about your own personal shopping habits. Are you going in more convenient, smaller box stores? I think we've seen a lot of that across all kinds of channels, including ours. And part of our desire is how do we -- now that we're getting those new customers or frankly, more so new occasions from existing customers. How do we make sure that we provide them a stellar shopping experience now and permanently change those shopping behaviors, so we keep those occasions going forward? That's what we're really focused on. \nJamere Jackson : Yeah, just to build on that. One of the things we've been paying a lot of attention to internally, is just a tremendous success that we're having in our loyalty program. Our loyalty member sales are up 32% versus last year. And when I look at the stats around the number of members that are earning rewards, the number of members that are redeeming rewards, the spend for those loyalty customers relative to last year on a per transaction basis, and the retention rate, all of those numbers are up.  And so that gives us a lot of confidence that, the things that we've done in terms of our in-store execution, are driving great results. So as we think about share gains are lots of things that are part of that mix including some of the dynamics that you talked about on a macro basis.  But our execution has just been fantastic in this environment. And the data around our loyalty programs certainly suggests that we're doing the right things. And those are the kinds of sales that are a lot stickier than, when you have non-member sales.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. \nBrian Nagel : Good morning. Great quarter. \nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning. Thank you.\nBrian Nagel : So the first question I want to ask, Bill, this goes back to early in your prepared comments. You talked about the cadence of sales through the period. So this -- where did you end? What was the exit rate is the quarter concluded?  And now just a bit of a follow up to all those questions. But if you look at the business now, do you think stimulus is still driving it now? Or was that largely been burned through? \nWilliam Rhodes: We exited -- I don't have the numbers right in front of me, because I went through -- I quoted some of them in the script. And we were very intentional about that, that talk about those four weak differences. So that you can see, as we were -- before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%, I think it was 49.9.  And when we came out the other side, and on a two-year basis, we were still up 26.7 in those last four weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last four weeks this year, were 14% with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single digit range. So what we have seen is that stimulus -- those stimulus dollars that came in March. They stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected.  Similar to what happened last summer, if you remember our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year. So clearly, that will be a headwind as we look in Q4, but not completely. Does that help? \nBrian Nagel : No, it's very helpful. I appreciate it. Then my second -- I guess my follow up question would be something maybe bigger picture. But you look at the commercial business. And obviously a lot of cross currents at this point. But your commercials been a bright spot for AutoZone for a while. It's straight been here lately. As you look out there, what do you view? Is this still the slack within your model? And you're talking about opening the new -- the mega hubs and launching new programs? How should we think about the real drivers going forward as particularly as we pull out of this COVID crisis? \nWilliam Rhodes: Well, as Jamere mentioned, we have 50 mega hubs now. We're on a path ever 100 to 110. So we will more than double the amount of mega hubs that we have today. And I will tell you, Jamere, who's in charge of store development, has a big bogey out there to make that happen very fast. And you'll see significant amount of mega hubs come online this quarter, and over the next year.  So I think that that will help us in a big way. As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago, it's still that way today. If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers.  I also talked about all this technology that we've rolled out. And we're still in the very early innings of that. We've seen reductions in our delivery times. But we are looking for significantly bigger, larger reductions in delivery times as this technology matures as our team understands how to utilize it and how to change. Getting parts and products frankly, out of the building is our biggest focus, not necessarily the drive time.\nBrian Nagel : Appreciate Thank you. \nWilliam Rhodes: All right, thank you very much. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We're excited about our future growth prospects. But we take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives.  We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.  Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country's heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 31.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales. And our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2% as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales.  Our growth was broad based as national accounts and local and regional accounts, both grew over 40% in the quarter. Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I've said previously, we're focused on building a faster growing business with discipline investments in pricing service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity, as we are significantly under penetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores. And we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts.  This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs finishing with 5107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers.  Our strategy is working as we continue to grow share this past quarter. We're confident that we can continue to gain shear as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, make improvements in our assortment, maintain competitive pricing, and stay committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past four quarters and position as well in the marketplace.  As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our mega hub strategy is improving our parts availability, and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened two more mega hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations. And we expect to open between four and seven more mega hubs by the end of the fiscal year.  As you might recall from last quarters conference call, we raised our near-term target of build out of mega hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega hubs help us expand coverage and say yes, we have it more frequently. Expanding our mega hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business.  Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. Third, we're committed to being price competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results.  We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our plans to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business.  On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share, and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad based across regions and categories.  In the quarter we delivered double digit comps and eight of the 12 weeks. And all 12 weeks had positive comps, despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share as measured by NPD grew nearly two points for the first eight weeks of the quarter. And we saw double digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter.  We also who share in April, despite the tremendous growth last year signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas.  First, the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes. And our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear we are winning in the marketplace and execution of our AutoZoners, we're taking care of our customers is a key competitive advantage.  Second, the assortment work and mega hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability leading to a meaningful lift in sales. Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts. Buy online pick up in-store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home which were up against significantly this quarter have helped us meet customers when where and how they want to shop.  We're particularly pleased with buy online pick up in-store the fastest growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure play competitors.  Fourth, and similar to our commercial approach, we're using discipline and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively price. This is a data-rich environment and our data-driven approach tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage.  We've tested our approach in key categories and markets and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth albeit it's slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working. And we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lapped the accelerated sales growth that we've seen over the past four quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results.  Now, let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter we open seven new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores, and one new store in Brazil to finish with 47.  On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future.  I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business in our investment in our pricing initiatives.  As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter. We're also making discipline pricing investments to drive top line-growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpace the remaining market this quarter.  Our approach is discipline and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determine which actions move the sales and gross profit dollar performance in the right direction. We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product care categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry's pricing remains rational, and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business. And as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter.  We will continue to drive new customers and overtime grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster and historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses, compared to last year third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Even for the quarter was $804 million or 63% versus the prior year quarter, or EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top-line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier.  Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million down 5% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million and last year's fourth quarter. Our adjusted debt level metric finished a quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving the tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable, and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million up 73.9% versus last year third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lowered by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed.  And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year, and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year driven by new stores.  Net inventory is defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately $21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter-end we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares.  The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carry over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first three quarters of the year. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year.  Our business remains remarkably strong. And this will enable us to invest in our existing assets grow our business, and as I emphasized earlier, return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach.  So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.  Our strategy is working. And I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill. Good morning, Bret. Yeah, what I'll say in general, is that we've been very disciplined about the investments that we've been making in pricing. As I mentioned, this is a very data-rich environment. We're using data-driven through tools. We're using artificial intelligence and data science to help us figure out exactly where to price, which categories to price, which reasons to price. So it's a very dynamic environment in that regard. We're fortunate that we don't have to peanut butter spread this across the chain, if you will. So, what we're doing is very surgical and very strategic. What I'll say in terms of the competitive responses that the industry remains very rational. We're seeing rational pricing across the industry and the response. To that extent, it's been pretty muted. So our strategy is working. Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher-margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value.  And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that, all the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just one element of it. And I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned, the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand, including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold, those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with, it's helping us lower our delivery times, is a significant impact on the business.  The work that we're doing around mega hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth.  And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market. Yeah, that's the right cadence to think about. One of the things that Bill mentioned is that, we don't have around to plan here. So, as we rolled the price investments through the entire chain, and all the categories that we're going to roll it through, you'll start to see us anniversary this in the back half of next year.  So -- and again, we're pleased with the execution of those initiatives. Again, it's one element of the strategy, if you will. It certainly gets a lot of a lot of attention. But we would not be in a position to even be talking about making pricing investments if we weren't executing so well, on all of the other elements of the strategy. And when I think about, again, the work that we've done on assortment, I think about the work that we're doing to lean in the technology. Those things have been the foundation or the enablers for us to then focus on this element of being competitively priced.  And, I said it a couple of times in my prepared comments about having the best merchandise at the right price. That combined with the other things that we're working on, give us a meaningful competitive advantage. And it's why we're so bullish about being a faster growing business in the future. Well, we've done a couple of things in this environment where we've had accelerated sales. Number one, we've had outstanding leverage on the SG&A line, which quite frankly served as a little bit of a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making in gross margin. And we do have the ability as we move forward to continue to price in a very disciplined way, when we're in an environment where there's inflation. Quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price. And we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories.  But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. So, going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars, that's going to give us tremendously powerful free cash flow.  And you can tweak margins by a point or a point and a half, doesn't change the underlying story here, which is this is a business that is generating a tremendous amount of cash. And we're putting that to work by investing in our existing assets. We're investing in our growth initiatives, and we're returning meaningful amounts of cash to investors in a meaningful way. That portion of the AutoZone model does not change even with all the things that we've talked about this morning in terms of investments. Yeah. So in terms of our commercial mix, we're very bullish about our commercial business. And, as we talk pretty extensively about today, and last quarter, we're investing in a disciplined way in our commercial business. This past quarter, our national accounts and our regional and local accounts both grew over 40%. We are pleased to see the Nationals actually snap back car counts are up, staffing has improved, miles driven is improving.  And we're under penetrated. We think we're roughly a four to five share in a $75 billion category. So there's a tremendous opportunity to create a faster growing business here. And as we execute on this growth playbook and see significant share gains, we will likely be in a position where we see a little bit of a mixed drag from commercial on the overall margins. And that's going to be perfectly okay. This will be a faster growing and still high margin business as we move forward.  And, as we see that growth materialize, we'll be very transparent about what our expectations are. Thanks. Yeah, so we're seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing, some higher transportation costs. But as I said before, the industry pricing is rational. And this has always been an industry that's price to recover those inflationary impacts. And we're pricing accordingly in this environment as well.  Transportation costs in particular, we've had some contracted rates that are below the spot market. So this is protected us to some extent. But we'll see more of those as we move forward.  From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than, what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage.  Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams, and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment. And as -- we also believe that from a macro standpoint, as some of the enhanced unemployment benefits start to ease and be retracted. We think that will sort of unstick the labor market to a certain extent.  But all the efforts that we're doing inside of our company to attract talent, is quite frankly, one of the reasons that we've been able to put up the kind of numbers that we put up in both our DIY and our commercial business. Well, I think a couple of things will potentially happen there. One is that, we'll see labor costs start to go up in different environments. We're already seeing some markets where labor costs have gone up in that zip code. And what you have to be able to do is, more importantly, you have to be able to price accordingly, so that you don't have the margin and profitability drags.  And so when I think about the impacts of inflation, it isn't just what we're seeing in product costs, or transportation costs, but labor is a part of that equation. And we'll be disciplined enough to price accordingly, in that environment as well. Yeah, so parts availability is a big piece of the story that we have in the commercial market today. When we put a mega hub in a market, two things happen. Number one, we see a lift in sales in the four walls, if you will of the mega hub. But it also gives us an opportunity as we're selling to commercial accounts.  It gives us an opportunity to tell the commercial accounts in that area, if you will, that we have parts available, significantly more parts available than we would otherwise. And that gives us a meaningful lift and sale.  So a big piece of that strategy that we've talked about is improving that assortment, putting mega hubs in the marketplace, signaling to the market, that we have more parts available in the marketplace. And then taking advantage of that that opportunity. We've talked about lots of things that drive our commercial business. But, in the top one or two is parts availability. If we have the parts, if we can get them there in a reasonable amount of time, they're competitively priced. We're easy to do business with that gives us a tremendous tailwind for this business. And that's what we're excited about. Yeah, just to build on that. One of the things we've been paying a lot of attention to internally, is just a tremendous success that we're having in our loyalty program. Our loyalty member sales are up 32% versus last year. And when I look at the stats around the number of members that are earning rewards, the number of members that are redeeming rewards, the spend for those loyalty customers relative to last year on a per transaction basis, and the retention rate, all of those numbers are up.  And so that gives us a lot of confidence that, the things that we've done in terms of our in-store execution, are driving great results. So as we think about share gains are lots of things that are part of that mix including some of the dynamics that you talked about on a macro basis.  But our execution has just been fantastic in this environment. And the data around our loyalty programs certainly suggests that we're doing the right things. And those are the kinds of sales that are a lot stickier than, when you have non-member sales."

Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we've had - have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they've taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all.  I also want to reiterate, our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners, again.  Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercials growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses, but especially for commercial.  We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all-time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing four quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes.  Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter, we stripped -- this quarter stretch from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first four weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the Central and Southeastern states.  Sales picked up for the next four weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final four weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these four weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those four weeks, we averaged a 14% comp, with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. We continue to maintain solid growth rates post-stimulus. For Q3, our two-year comp was 27.9%. On a two-year stack basis, the first four weeks were up 17.9%, the next four weeks were up an impressive 49.9%, and the last four weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter, with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate, as the reintroduction of Federal Stimulus Payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic.  During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer basis, we saw the majority of the country performed consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others; no, not this quarter.  These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and the DIFM. And we believe that winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall.  And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The shared data we have available for the first eight weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter's call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment, as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts.  We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management teams' commitment to doing what is right and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales and sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us.  However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year. And we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical.  Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history. As last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July, and we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY, as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. Now, let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter, our net income was $596 million, and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter.  Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion dollar market. And we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools antifreeze, small repair and floormats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. And our hard parts business comp in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items.  We believe the strengthening of our hard parts businesses due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories, such as accessories and batteries, notably brakes and rotors. While still slightly below our average growth had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather.  As we expect, our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. We believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses positioned us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry.  In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects.  Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times. Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this timeframe. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, but doing so in a very safe manner.  At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter, 30 years after going public is just amazing. But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment.  We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn, but we will be deliberate.  We understand the value of the capital invested as our capital as our investors' capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. But we must keep focused and continue to deliver. There are no layups, we must continue to innovate.  While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds.  Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial businesses still in the very early innings of the maturation process.  It is an honor to have reported this morning, that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing four quarter basis. But we hope, and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season. But we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company.  Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Yeah, Jamere talked about the fact that we're beginning to see some pretty significant inflation on certain product categories. I don't think that that's been a big driver of our performance in Q3, but it is something that we are very mindful of as we move into Q4. And frankly, we have in the past, some of those costs along to our customers, just like we've done for the last 40 years. Yes. Simeon, good morning, and thank you for the question. Clearly, they're on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on two different spectrums of the business.  One on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments, and then two on very slow moving hard to find powerful - maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is, when you can walk in the store and get the immediate product availability.  The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today and we've done that work. And it's all in place. And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive, because we took prices to a different level. We continue to roll out the pricing initiatives that we're working. We originally started with six regions, then we went to 14 regions.  As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. We don't plan on having around two of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also, more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different.  When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition that gets other sectors of the industry. Yeah. I would say it's the elasticity of demand for us, but it's not driving elasticity of demand for the industry. I think in some respects, it's improved our competitive position, not against our in-channel competitors, but against other competitors and that's proven to be successful.  As we think about an inflationary environment, I know AutoZone will make sure that we pass those costs along to our consumers, just like we always have. And I don't think that that'll be any different than normal. All right. Thank you, Simeon. I understand your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right. And that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time as clearly there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about -- picking up the gross profit dollars.  But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this, we've tested it extensively for over a year. Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial or our closest competitors may follow us. They may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition.  It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close in competitors. We feel like we're doing exceptionally well with that. I think also want to go back to what Jamere said.This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over three years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website all making us much easier to do business with, and substantially lowering our delivery times. We've continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. People used to think that that was a headwind. Now people understand that as a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out hubs and mega hubs, where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products.  So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years, because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics, but the overall operating margin characteristics.  And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough through. Remember in 2005, when I came into this role, and we made an SG&A investment. Everybody said, Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A, or the beginning of the operating margins going from 17.5 down to 12. Well, what happened? Over time, we found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that'll happen from here. But these are very marginal investments, to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels. Michael, before I turn that second part over to Jamere, I want to hit your earlier part. I was very clear, in my comment a few minutes ago, that as of now we have rolled out this commercial pricing initiative across the vast majority of the chain. And as Jamere said there is no Act 2 under development or under consideration.  So as we annualize this time next year, we'll be annualizing those investments. Jamere? Thanks. Thanks, Scot. Let me jump in there. As you know, Scot, we've been dealing with accelerated labor inflation for some time for five years. And we have many markets where we're already at $15 or above. I was recently in Seattle. Our minimum wage in Seattle is $16.70. And we are figuring out a way to make sure that we manage through that. And part of that is our pricing has to be different when we have that kind of change in our labor component of our cost structure. Thank you, Scot. Clearly, we said over a long, long period of time that miles driven is a good indicator of what -- of how our business is going to perform. However, we've also said and we said this back in the Great Recession, that in certain times, it's not a good predictor of what happens in our business.  Clearly, if you just straight line what happens to miles driven, you would never forecast what happened to us over the last year. Because miles driven were down significantly, but there was a new element called Federal Stimulus. And we were talking this morning that, a family of four, over the last four years or last four quarters has picked up over $10,000 in Federal Stimulus. That does not count, unemployed -- Enhanced Unemployment Benefits, that is just the stimulus.  For our customer, that's a tremendous amount of money. And many of those customers turn to their automobiles and enhanced them repaired them or whatever the case may be. Clearly, as miles driven return, there will be some small tailwind. But I don't think that it will be nearly enough to offset the headwind that will come from us lapping those tremendous amounts of economic stimulus that were in the environment. We're calling it that internally. We're putting the pressure on the team, we got to keep that. I think that there's some level of stimulus. It's been in our commercial performance as well, but not nearly to the extent that it has helped accelerate the DIY business.  So we have big expectations to continue to grow commercial at fairly robust rates going forward. Clearly, the DIY piece will be more challenged as we head into Q4, and really frankly the next 12 months. But commercial we think, is a much stickier business. Yes, we picked up new customers. More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business.  As Jamere said, as far as the trade-off between the up and down the street customer or the national account customer. Before this quarter, our up and down the street business was performing much better than our national account business. This quarter, the national account business was generally in line with our up and down the street business. And as we talked to those leaders, their businesses have improved along the same lines. Thank you. Yeah, I think the share gains that we got because of store closures were really over around May of last year. But we've continued to grow share gains, as consumer behaviors have changed.  Just think about not -- whether or not a store is open. But think about your own personal shopping habits. Are you going in more convenient, smaller box stores? I think we've seen a lot of that across all kinds of channels, including ours. And part of our desire is how do we -- now that we're getting those new customers or frankly, more so new occasions from existing customers. How do we make sure that we provide them a stellar shopping experience now and permanently change those shopping behaviors, so we keep those occasions going forward? That's what we're really focused on. Good morning. Thank you. We exited -- I don't have the numbers right in front of me, because I went through -- I quoted some of them in the script. And we were very intentional about that, that talk about those four weak differences. So that you can see, as we were -- before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%, I think it was 49.9.  And when we came out the other side, and on a two-year basis, we were still up 26.7 in those last four weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last four weeks this year, were 14% with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single digit range. So what we have seen is that stimulus -- those stimulus dollars that came in March. They stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected.  Similar to what happened last summer, if you remember our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year. So clearly, that will be a headwind as we look in Q4, but not completely. Does that help? Well, as Jamere mentioned, we have 50 mega hubs now. We're on a path ever 100 to 110. So we will more than double the amount of mega hubs that we have today. And I will tell you, Jamere, who's in charge of store development, has a big bogey out there to make that happen very fast. And you'll see significant amount of mega hubs come online this quarter, and over the next year.  So I think that that will help us in a big way. As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago, it's still that way today. If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers.  I also talked about all this technology that we've rolled out. And we're still in the very early innings of that. We've seen reductions in our delivery times. But we are looking for significantly bigger, larger reductions in delivery times as this technology matures as our team understands how to utilize it and how to change. Getting parts and products frankly, out of the building is our biggest focus, not necessarily the drive time. All right, thank you very much. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We're excited about our future growth prospects. But we take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives.  We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.  Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country's heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

Okay. Well, good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To start off this morning, I'll spend some time talking about our sales results, trends over the 12 weeks, merchandise categories that drove our performance, and any regional discrepancies. As I said in our press release this morning, we could not deliver the kind of results we had without the heroic efforts of our store and supply chain AutoZoners. While classified as essential workers, essential seems insufficient to describe their remarkable contributions to our company, our customers and our results. Our AutoZoners have really stepped up during the pandemic and been nothing short of exceptional. And our top priority remains being committed to providing all of our AutoZoners with a safe work environment. To be sure to, so they can help our customers. While Jamere, we'll talk more about this when he discusses the investments we've been making. I will say the additional Emergency Time Offer or ETO we offered is something we just knew was the right thing to do for our AutoZoners. Thank you AutoZoners again. Okay. Let's turn to our sales results. Our overall comp sales were up 15.2% this quarter, our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strongest quarter. With retail comps being slightly stronger than commercial, commercial came on strong at the end of the quarter and comps similarly to retail for the last four weeks. Let's review our sales cadence. We told you on our last call we ran an 8.8% comp for the last four weeks of Q1. In the first four weeks of this quarter. Our sales accelerated to a 10.7% comp. As the holidays arrived, we saw further acceleration, which was sustained for the balance of the quarter. We ran a 17.5% comp pretty consistently over the last eight weeks of the quarter. This quarter's traffic versus ticket growth was pretty close to split down the middle, although ticket was slightly stronger. It was encouraging us - for us to see sales, inflect upward starting in January with both ticket and traffic moving higher. Our ticket growth was stronger this quarter due to hard part sales mixing higher than what we experienced in the first quarter. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and well being of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow all the national, state and local mandates and ordinances, and have always kept close tabs on the CDC guidelines. We continue to require masks entering our facilities perform questionnaires of our team members and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing masks, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. And just last week, we announced that we would provide every AutoZoner with a $100 reward once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This is just the next logical step in our efforts to provide a safe, working and shopping environment. I continue to be inspired by our Board and our management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first. You see, our values and our culture have been in full force and effect over the last year in this pandemic. Addressing our supply chain, we've done a solid job with handling the extra demand, and our in-stock levels have continued to improve. To provide a little more color on industry drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we go further and further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits that ended last July. In the first week of January, over $100 billion of stimulus was distributed to Americans. The majority of these funds was for the onetime checks as part of the $600 billion stimulus package passed in late December. While smaller in size than the April disbursements, we did see our business pick up nicely, and our sales remained elevated throughout the remainder of the quarter. While we continue to be encouraged with the current selling environment, we feel any additional stimulus should lead to a strong sales environment. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country perform well, with the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others pretty consistently. Again, these markets, which represent just over 25% of our store base, were solid but not as strong as the remaining markets. For example, the spread in comp sales between these markets and the others was approximately 300 basis points for the quarter. We believe the separation was due to lingering effects of a mild winter last year and colder weather happening later this winter. But winter did come this year. Boy, did it? And the performance gap closed. So we are encouraged about the summertime and believe we won't have to discuss why mild winter affected comp sales during our upcoming fourth quarter. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the mid single-digit range, with our sales closer to three times, the industry's growth rate. While we are thrilled to have these share gains now, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the spring and summer months. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about sales for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the third fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have a much more difficult comparison in the fourth fiscal quarter as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package. For now, it remains difficult for us to predict sales for the remainder of the year. This is especially true for the fourth quarter of this year when we were up against the fourth quarter of previous year's 21.8% comp store sales growth. While we continue to expect our sales growth will moderate over time, we believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. Over the long term, if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, we reminded you the strongest periods we'd experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, 2001 and 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary environments. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retained many of those customers in the years that followed. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 15.2% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $346 million. And our EPS was $14.93 a share, 20.5% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 16% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 15%. For commercial, we averaged over $53 million in weekly sales, which was over $10,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter that is normal as the winter months are lower selling months for us. Moving forward, we remain very encouraged with what we are doing within our commercial business. The initiatives we have in place are helping our sales. I'll remind you that, this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there were some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales force categories continue to be strong, with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. In fact, our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This is the first quarter since the pandemic began where we saw our hard grow in line with sales force. Our business improved in many merchandize categories such as batteries, categories like brakes and rotors are not comping as high as the overall business. We believe this performance gap with certain categories will close as miles driven continue to improve. As for this year's winter, it was late arriving, but it did arrive. Overall, we view the winter as not having a material impact on our upcoming spring and summer business one way or the other. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. On last quarter's call, we announced we would be expensing additional payroll during the second quarter. The additional expense was to provide our AutoZoners with more emergency time-off. While this is the second time in our history, we've offered ETO benefits, we believe it is the least we could do to support our AutoZoners in the field. This extra time-off award has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. Our AutoZoners have the right to use the benefits to address medical emergencies, take time off to get the vaccine, take additional paid vacation time-off or wait until the end of the calendar year and get paid what remains in their incremental paid vacation bank. In January, we paid out $31 million to AutoZoners who didn't utilize the ETO we offered them back in March of 2020. I have to tell you, it was an honor to provide these AutoZoners with sizable checks in recognition of their heroic efforts. We feel this is a very important investment in our AutoZoners and in their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $2.9 billion, up 16%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q2 last year. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business. For the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 14.7% to $639 million. Sequentially, commercial growth was nearly three points higher than Q1. In the quarter, sales to our commercial customers represented 22% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $10,500, up 11.7%. We averaged $53 million in total weekly commercial sales. Internally, we have been executing against our commercial acceleration program where we are focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service, technology and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 45 net new programs, finishing with 5,088 total programs. And our sales efficiency per store remained at near-record levels as we leveraged our DIY infrastructure and increased our share of wallet with existing customers. Let me be clear, our strategy is working. We believe we grew share and we remain focused on repeating this for the balance of fiscal 2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts, improvements in our assortment and parts covered by model year, more competitive pricing and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past three quarters and position us well in the marketplace. And as we move forward, we are focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability. We opened one more Mega-Hub this quarter, bringing our total to 48 locations, and we expect to open between 7 and 10 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. Given the success of our Mega-Hubs and increasing parts availability and driving meaningful sales lift, we're now raising our target from 75 to 90 mega hubs at build-out to 100 into 110. These stores help us expand coverage and say, yes, we have it more frequently. Second, we are leveraging technology to improve delivery times and service levels. The technology investments we're making in electronic ordering and tracking will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. We're making it simpler to do business with AutoZone, and we're driving efficiency for our sales professionals and drivers. Third, we are committed to being price competitive. We have a laser focus on the key categories where investment and pricing lead to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. We like the competitive hand that we have in our commercial business and believe we are in the early innings of a transformational growth story. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our retail acceleration initiatives. We're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY share growth. Like the commercial initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are running an intense playbook in DIY that is driving solid results for our business. First, the assortment work and mega hubs strategy that I mentioned earlier drive tremendous benefits to our DIY business. Our investments are improving coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful impact on trial and repeat purchase activity. Second, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with the work we have done on the digital front. Our efforts in Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home have helped us meet customers win where and how they want to shop. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the customer experience and make it easier to shop our broad array of products. Third and similar to our commercial approach, we have a laser-like focus on being competitively priced in the marketplace. We're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to drive pricing decisions in certain categories, categories where we typically compete with non-traditional competitors like mass and online-only sellers in commodities and very slow-moving parts and products. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. This is a data-rich environment, and our tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. Again, we're living up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, and we believe it is helping us create a faster-growing business. Fourth, we simply have a relentless focus on execution. As Bill mentioned, our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have delivered exceptional results in a tough environment. As I said last quarter, perhaps the best investment we have made in our company is the investment in additional emergency time-off. In return, we continue to see our supply chain process record volume and our store AutoZoners handled record store traffic, while still delighting our customers. This focus on execution is a meaningful competitive advantage for us and we're winning in the marketplace. Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. First, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores to finish with 628 stores and our store sales accelerated sequentially. Like last quarter, the exchange rate again played a role in the U.S. dollar equivalent reported sales. The exchange rate finished the quarter at roughly 77% higher than last year's second quarter rate. That's 7% higher than last quarter's second rate. And as a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we're seeing signs of a turnaround in the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we opened one new store to finish with 46 stores this quarter. The Brazilian real continues to face headwinds and devalued roughly 25% for Q2 over last year. Long term, Brazil will be an important market for AutoZone and we will invest in a disciplined way. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 77 basis points. 37 basis points of margin headwind is due to higher supply chain costs, including a onetime benefit last year that did not repeat this year. The remaining 40 basis points came from our pricing initiatives, loyalty program and mix shift. As I discussed above, we're focused on competitive pricing that will drive top line and gross profit dollar gains. To be clear though, the industry's pricing remains rational, and overall, we still have pricing power. We have tested certain categories and taken action when we have the ability to drive both top line and gross profit dollar gains. This is a dynamic market and we remain disciplined in our approach. The strategy is working. We see our work translating into higher sales and profits, as evidenced by the transaction and share growth that Bill mentioned earlier. As we continue to refine our strategy over the next several quarters, we're planning for higher sales and gross profit dollars that outpace the drag from gross margin rate. This is a good outcome for our business as we're driving new customers and retention. All of the investments we are making suggest that we're growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. Again, our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Regarding operating expenses, our teams, particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses are up 12.5% versus last year's Q2. But included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $40 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses, which represented 4.2% of the overall SG&A growth. We believe our decision to provide emergency time-off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic was absolutely the right thing to do. As I said last quarter, this is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $482 million, up 18.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the last fiscal year's third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $46 million to $47 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $47.5 million in last year's third quarter. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion versus last year's Q2 ending balance of just under $5.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And long term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving to tax, our tax rate was 20.6% versus 17.7% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 265 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year, it benefited 412 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $346 million, up 15.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.2 million was lower by 4.1% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.93, up 20.5% over the prior year second quarter. Let me talk a few minutes about our cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $356 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $150 million over last year's Q2. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter versus $315 million last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was two times. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remained significantly higher than historical levels. We now have $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which approximately $830 million is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was flat versus Q2 last year. Inventory per store was $715,000 versus $713,000 last year and $702,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 2.8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $93,000 versus negative $41,000 last year and negative $99,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113% versus last year's Q2 of 105.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we restarted our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, began methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again. But we feel comfortable with our strategy and our execution. As I mentioned, we spent $900 million on stock repurchases, representing 752,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. This will enable us to grow our business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. So to wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and this gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere, and I have to take a moment and recognize you. Your grasp of the fundamentals of this business in less than six months is extraordinary, and thank you for being here. We're so glad you joined the team. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times and they continue to require us to look at many things differently while managing our business day to day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team, across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets.  We are fortunate to have extraordinary people, who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. They've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far, but we must stay focused and we must continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate and we must continue to execute. Our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well. We understand trends will slow in the future. We're going to work. We're going to work as hard as possible to gain as much share as possible and limit our headwinds. And we continue to see a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. Our business continues to do very well and we are still in the early innings of growth. But as always, we have work to do as we head into our spring selling season. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and our customer's safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Michael Lasser, UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Bill Rhodes, I want you to elaborate a bit on pricing investments and other investments that are being weighting on your gross margin? Do you view this as a temporary condition and once you get - you on the next few quarter your gross margin will stabilize or is this is going to be beginning of a longer-term trend of your gross margin continuing to be down for the foreseeable future?\nWilliam Rhodes: Well, thank you for the question, Michael. Yes, as you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades. We found some particular specific opportunities where we found places to invest and improve our value proposition to our customers. They're very specific pieces, both in the retail business and the commercial business. I don't know exactly what's going to happen a year from now. Our team is going to continue to innovate. We are constantly raising prices and we are constantly lowering prices, trying to find that sweet spot where our customers value - the value that they're getting the best. So I don't know exactly what it's going to be over the long term. But if you recap and what Jamere said, the gross margin, we had about 40 basis points, which was a onetime negative from last year. So, all the things that were embedded in there, of which price was one of them, accumulated to 40 basis points. Frankly, I'm not that smart to know what the gross margin is going to be within 40 basis points, two or three years from now.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And you articulated a lot of confidence that your commercial growth can accelerate this year. How - what's driving you to make that statement? Are you seeing some customer wins that already give you the visibility that it can accelerate?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. We talked, I guess, probably three years ago that we were embarking on a new commercial study, and we developed a new strategy that we began rolling out probably 18 months or so ago. And we're still in the early innings of rolling out that strategy. It has many different elements. I mean, this Hub and Mega-Hub portion of the strategy, which is taking years but it is making a meaningful difference, a very meaningful difference in our ability to say yes to our customers. And it's leaning towards commercial although, it's helping DIY tremendously as well. That's an element of it. We've rolled out new technology in our commercial business. Handheld technology, which allows us to be able to better understand what our delivery times are and manage our delivery times better. We're significantly already reduced our delivery times in the last six months, and we think we have more room to go. We've also enhanced our website, and our ability to communicate and be easy to do business with, with our commercial customers. So I don't think it's - and then, of course, the ongoing evolution and building of the Duralast brand. So it's not one individual issue. It's an amalgamation of all these different issues coming together and improving our competitive position. Not to mention, during the global pandemic and the stay at home and safe at home orders, we were there for our customers, every day. And that allowed us to introduce ourselves at a different level to some customers. And I think that has resulted in stickier long-term relationships.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: I think you touched on this in the prepared remarks. Can we talk about price elasticity and some of the investments you're making? I think in the past, there hasn't been a lot of elasticity in price in this category. And can you talk about, the immediacy of some of the reaction you're seeing from consumers? Or is this, 'Hey, we're doing well. We're investing for the future. So the customer, when they come back a year from now or a few quarters from now, we're in a better position.'\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I would say a couple of things. First, as I said in our script, and it's pretty clear from the data that we have. The strategy is working. What we're seeing is the benefits of top line growth. We're seeing our share numbers go up. We're seeing strong traffic. We're seeing ticket. We're seeing unit growth, so all of the metrics point to the fact that the strategy is working. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing a ton of cost pressures that are material. And industry pricing remains rational. So what we're doing is part of this strategy is very surgical. In other words, we're not peanut butter-spreading, price declines across the business, but we're being very surgical using very sophisticated data and analytics. And those are the thing that give us a lot of confidence that what we\u2019re doing makes a lot of sense for the consumer and makes a lot of sense for us. So as we move forward, we're going to continue to lean into this strategy. And our approach is delivered in the marketplace. Listen, I - as I spent time over the last six months or so, I like the competitive hand that we have, if we can continue to delight our customers the way we have over the past year or so, and we live up to the pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, this will continue to be a win for our shareholders, and we're going to see the results in the bottom line of our business.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up is just on pricing for 2021 or calendar 2021. Are you - what are you seeing in terms of pricing? Can inflation be a bigger driver than it was in prior years? Thank you for that.\nJamere Jackson: Well, I mean, our approach on inflation, quite frankly, is to be disciplined. Where we see commodity price inflation, we have to be disciplined enough to take price to recover that. And that's something that we've done over time in the business. What we're seeing today is we don't see any material increases that have us concerned. But if we do, we will be disciplined to make sure that we're taking price to recover those bumps that we see from commodity pricing. So even in an environment where we're trying to be as surgical as we can about the pricing moves that we make, and as Bill said, we're taking price up and price down, where it makes sense for us to take pricing, we do have pricing power and we're disciplined enough to take price where we see commodity inflation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChristian Carlino: It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Just - it might have been touched on an earlier question. Just wondering on the gross margin outlook, is it going to be 1Q 2022 when you start to lap these higher loyalty redemptions and markdowns, where you start to get flat to up gross margins? And similarly, were there - the one-time impact this year, that was from lapping the supply chain leverage last year, correct?\nJamere Jackson: That's right. So as we said, we had about 77 basis points of deleverage this quarter. About 40% of that was related to supply chain costs, and the other roughly 40 basis points is the supply chain costs and the remainder is the initiatives that we talked about. And what I'll say about our outlook in the future is that we're going to continue to lean into the strategy that we have today, because in this environment, what we're seeing is it's working. We're getting top line. We're getting EBIT dollar growth, and we're going to lean into that as we move forward. So we won't be date-certain necessarily about when you'll see an inflection point, because we're in the early innings of this strategy and it's delivering for us.\nWilliam Rhodes: Let me add to that for just a second, too. You mentioned loyalty. And we don't know what's going to happen to loyalty costs as we go forward. The reason our loyalty costs are up is because our customers are doing more repeat business with us. The biggest part of our growth is coming from existing customers returning to our stores more frequently. We are tickled to death with that. I hope it continues next year and is another pressure point because it means we're gaining additional share, and it's a very profitable share gain for us.\nChristian Carlino: And then when you think about the lagged impact of the weather, both the better winter weather on whole and the recent events in Texas, these events in Texas hurt in the near term, but you would expect a net positive as we get to the summer?\nWilliam Rhodes: Absolutely. And yes, you're right. There's a temporary - while people are locked down, our business suffers and suffers significantly, but when things warm up, our business rebounds immediately and for a sustained period of time. More importantly, those conditions put significant incremental wear and tear on certain under-car parts. And there's a lag effect that will typically last nine months or so for us. And it's something we were talking about before the pandemic. The fact that our business was expected to be soft last spring and summer because we had a mild winter. Well, when the pandemic hit, that changed everything. But this year, we shouldn't have to be talking about a mild winter dampening our results in the spring and summer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBret Jordan: Talking a little bit about the share gains. And could you maybe bucket for us where you're seeing maybe more or less? Are you seeing more of these share gains from warehouse distributors in the three-step model? Or are you seeing an improving cadence and share gain from two-step peers? Maybe if you could talk about, sort of, where you see the shifts and some of the non-traditional channels on the DIY side as well.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, terrific question. And yes, you have to bifurcate it between what's going on in the retail sector versus what's going on in the commercial sector, both of which we're gaining share two times or three times - we're growing two times or three times faster than the industry growth rates by all indications we have. We have really good data on the retail share gains. We don't have as good a data but we can look at headline growth numbers in the commercial gains. On retail, we are picking up a lot of share from what's traditionally, we believe in the mass channel. I think a lot of people are not frequenting those large stores at the same rate that they did in the past. And what we're focused on is making sure, as we're getting those incremental visits, that we are going above and beyond so we get those visits in the future. I think also, as this brick-and-mortar omnichannel strategy comes to place, I think we're also not losing share that we might have been losing before to the online channel, and in fact, maybe gaining some of that share back over time. In the commercial sector, I think it's hard to say where the share is coming from. We are less than 4% market share in the commercial industry today. I think it's likely coming from probably multiple different places. We certainly have intensified our understanding of what the wholesale distributor market is doing, and we're paying more attention to them and our competitive analysis and building our strategy. And we think that over time, we've significantly changed our competitive position, particularly against the WDs. You think about what we've done with assortment, what we've done building a sales force and now we've got this technology that we have in place, it's going to improve our deliveries. I think that our competitive positioning in the marketplace is vastly different than what it was four, five years ago.\nBret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. And then a question on supply chain. You mentioned that batteries were strong in your category remarks. Do categories or particular areas that there is a shortage, either in stocks in the market in general? And I guess, obviously, we hear a lot about some of the import issues and freight costs. But is your - I guess, are you seeing any shifts in your supplier base to sort of diversify around that?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Certainly, Bret. We've experienced significant supply chain disruptions over the last 11 months. Certainly a lot less today than we had, call it, June, July, August. I think I mentioned on one of these calls, we couldn't get sandpaper for a while. We had trouble with fuses. We had trouble with tools. I mean, we just had such enormous surges in certain parts of our business that we couldn't keep up, and many of those came with an extended supply chain that ran into China or Asia. We've worked through most of those. I have to give our team and our battery suppliers some kudos that the battery business has been as strong as it's been for as long as it's been. And then we had this huge cold surge or cold snap and we did just fine. Our team was very creative and worked with lots of different suppliers to make sure we were in good shape. So we don't have any acute needs right now. Some issues on the edges. Our in-stock position has significantly improved, but it's not back to our normal levels yet, probably going to take a few more months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow-up on the DIY business. Earlier in the year, I think there was a concern that the DIY strength at the time, and this is back in the spring of last year, the strength at the time meant that maybe sales were being pulled forward. As you see the DIY business pick up here again, I guess that would suggest that, that wasn't really true. So I guess, how do you think about pull-forward and just the strength that you're seeing in the DIY business right now, and I guess, just the sustainability of it? Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: That's a terrific question, Seth. I'm not sure how to answer it all. Clearly, I think we talked that we were worried. If anything, we might have pulled forward some battery business, because those cars parked last spring, and they sat for five or six weeks, as soon as the safe at home went away, our battery business boomed. But that battery business has sustained really high levels ever since. We've seen no dip in our battery business. We've seen weeks where we're going up against tough winter weather where it might be softer. But overall, it has exceeded our expectations over the last 11 months. As far as sustainability of these sales surges, the thing that keeps resonating with me is, if you think about our business over really long periods of time, when our customers have incremental time and specifically, incremental money, our business outperforms normal periods of time. And it's been that way for the last decade when we get tax refunds. How much have we talked in this environment about the surge we see during tax refund season, which is just beginning right now? We've seen it every single year. And when and when tax refunds moved back three weeks, we had to spend a lot of time talking about it because it moved out of one quarter into another quarter. It's just evidence that when our customer who are often term as financially fragile, when they get some incremental dollars, we seem to get a disproportionate share of those funds. And we saw it again in January when the stimulus came out. It wasn't nearly the stimulus that we saw last April, but within a day, within a day, we saw that those funds showing up in significantly improved business for us. And that sustained itself through the end of the quarter. Now we're talking about another stimulus, which could frankly, could dwarf what happened last April. If that comes, what does that mean to our business? All the indications we have is it would be very strong for our business because each time we've seen those incremental dollars our business has performed better than normal.\nSeth Sigman: And Bill, I guess, you mentioned the gap between retail and commercial narrowing the last four weeks of the period. Did that actually mean that commercial accelerated through the period and exited at a stronger rate? And if so, can you just elaborate on that as well? I mean, do you think that's stimulus or something else?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I don't think the stimulus plays nearly as much in the commercial business as it does the DIY business. And I think most of the end consumers in the commercial business are higher socioeconomic - higher up on the socioeconomic ladder. So that incremental money doesn't mean as much to them. In fact, both businesses were doing really well. Commercial is continuing to rebound. But there are still elements of the commercial business that aren't as strong as they were pre-pandemic, particularly some of our national account players, the up and down the street business has been stronger than the national account business. And again, I think that, that has to do with the end consumer that is servicing or picking the UDS business versus picking the national account business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zach Fadem, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDavid Lantz: This is David Lantz on for Zach. Thanks for taking our questions. So within the 15% growth in commercial, how much would you attribute to new mega hubs? And can you talk about how performance in commercial business tends to evolve once you open a mega hub in a certain market?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So the key with mega hubs is that, it increases the number of SKUs that we have available, and it enables us to say, yes, more. And so to the extent that we have that coverage and those parts available, that bodes well for us as we're going into our existing customers and our new customers. What I'll say about commercial is that we grew 15%. We grew significantly with locals and nationals.  But probably the one story that I want people to continue to focus on is that, we're underpenetrated. I mean, a 4% share gives us a tremendous opportunity to create a faster-growing business. So as we execute on this growth playbook that we talked about, we're seeing significant share gains. We're pleased with that execution in the marketplace.  And the mega hub strategy, the things that we're doing with technology, the fact that we're laser-focused on being competitively priced, all of these things give us an opportunity to create a faster-growing business and we're pretty excited about it.\nDavid Lantz: And then just one more for me. Can you talk about the impact that you think the rollout of electric vehicles is happening in the industry and what you think could happen over the long-term there?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. First of all, we believe there's going to be a market. And AutoZone is going to be a big player, just as we are today with the internal combustion engine. Our strategy is simple. We're just going to follow the consumer just like we've done in the past. We're not wed to internal combustion engine technology. We've significantly changed our assortment over time to reflect the latest technology. So this is not an accidental threat for us. We're operating from a position of strength. If you think about our business today, we're already supplying parts and supplies to the EV market, things like wiper blades. We have world-class capabilities in supply chain and merchandising. We have great relationships and partnerships with the OEMs who have a seat at the table today and can help us forecast the volumes and the timing of the market changes. And we have this tremendous retail footprint in commercial business that gives us distribution points.  So as we think about the parts and supplies that are at risk with electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, there will be offsets. I mean, there will be - clearly, there'll be some things that are at risk, but there will be offsets to those. And there'll be opportunities for us in both DIY and DIFM. So listen, despite what we see in headlines and announcements from the OEMs, we're a bit cautious because the market has some near-term challenges that we're watching closely.  First of all, consumer adoption is uncertain. We - roughly 2% of the market today and it's growing slowly. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, the charging infrastructure is not ready for prime time. The rapid charging stations need to be built out. It's going to be expensive. It's probably going to take some combination of public and private partnerships. The business model there has an uncertain path to profitability. And quite frankly, we think there's going to be some need for some pretty significant power grid investments. But we do believe there's going to be a market and we're going to be a player, and we're simply going to follow the consumer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nKaty Hallberg: This is Katy on for Mike Baker. Thanks so much for taking our questions. Kind of tagging on to one of the previous questions asked. I was wondering, if you guys saw any difference in what your retail customers spent between the two rounds of stimulus, and if you saw any sort of category shift between those. Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I don't think we've really seen any significant category shifts. I mentioned the battery business has been particularly strong. We've seen - we talked about the sales floor business being really strong. What we have seen in recent - in this quarter is a resurgence of our hard parts business, in particular, some of the failure-related items. I think some of that has to do with actually getting into winter and having a more normal winter this year. We've also talked about our maintenance products not being at the same levels that we're experiencing in the rest of our business, things like brakes and rotors and the like. And I think that, that's personally a hold on from the lack of winter last year, and the fact that miles driven are down and those maintenance items for some of the higher socioeconomic groups may be negatively impacted.\nKaty Hallberg: And then just again, real quickly on the cash balance. I know you guys mentioned being fairly confident about more share repurchases through the end of the year. And I was just wondering if there are any other plans or sort of strategic investments to use some of that excess cash.\nJamere Jackson: Well, what we've said is that, we're going to take our free cash flow. And our number one priority has been and will continue to be to invest in our business in a disciplined way. The free cash flow that we generate inside the business gives us tremendous financial firepower to both invest in our business in a disciplined way and return significant amounts of cash to investors in the form of our repurchases currently. We've got tremendous confidence in that plan, and we're going to continue to execute as we finish out the balance of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Montani, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nMichael Montani: It's Mike Montani on for Greg Melich. Just wanted to ask two questions. I had 1 for Bill and then a follow-up for Jamere, if I could. So first off, for Bill, obviously, there's been a lot of investment in technology and multichannel. And I'm wondering, Bill, if you could just expand a little bit, if you care to go there on what percentage of the B2B business today is kind of digital ordering, if you think about that, almost $3 billion business. And then the same question for your retail business. We've been thinking probably 4% to 5% type range, but is that true? And then related was just, if you can talk about FedEx initiative as well as BOPIS? Just kind of some incremental color on what's working well in those two areas?\nWilliam Rhodes: There's a lot to unpack there, Mike. Thank you for the question. I really hate this new setup with Bill and Jamere. Used to if somebody said Bill and it was a hard question, I would just look at Giles and let him answer it. But you put it on me this time. So let's talk about our digital business. In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where our customer's really picking a channel, they're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are two primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buttons. And we fulfill it the exact same way regardless of how they initially interact with us. We've been doing a lot of work trying to make - doing it digitally with us, easier and we've made significant strides, really proud of the team that's been doing that work over the last couple of years, in particular. And we've also made a lot of other back office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone. We believe and hope over time that our percentage of digital penetration in the commercial business will continue to increase at a pretty rapid pace. On the retail side of the business, we kind of have three different businesses that we interact with. We have Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store. We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs, and customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day. Each one of those three businesses is growing significantly, really high rates faster than the rest of the business. But our Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store is growing at twice the rate of our ship to home and next-day delivery business. And that again shows us, once again - and remember, the way we price in the online world, if you do ship to home or next-day delivery, on most purchases, you can generally get a 20% discount. But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omni-channel provider. We've got to have great stores and great customer touch points, convenience and knowledge that our AutoZoners provide to our customers is very valuable to our customers. So I hope I unpacked that okay for you.\nMichael Montani: Great. Thank you, Bill. That was helpful. And then for Jamere, I guess you can have the tougher questions, which we get this from investors, which is really around the minimum wage. And obviously, we saw Walmart go up to $15-plus an hour. We've been thinking new hour kind of $13 to $14 an hour range. But the heart of the question really is when we try to analyze this, we think it could be 100 bp-plus headwind to the P&L in isolation. But then we think there's a lot of levers you all have to pull to kind of mitigate. And one thing, for example, was COVID costs seem to be running above 100 bps. So is this a case where we should be kind of confident that you all can kind of mitigate some of these headwinds to the extent that this happens in a rational way? Just any color that you can share there on productivity initiatives, pricing power would be super helpful.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is, we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that we've been contemplating for a while. The first thing I'll say is that, we've done a tremendous job inside of our operations, really driving productivity. And over time, what that's meant for us is that we have a highly productive workforce here that is delivering. And you can see that in this environment where we have accelerated sales growth, you're seeing us getting very decent leverage with our teams in the field. So that's one. The second thing is, the reality is that when there are inflationary pressures in the business, whether they're commodities or wages, you have to be disciplined as a company to make sure that you recover those. And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing. And we believe we're going to have that pricing power into the future. And then I think the third thing that stands out to me as it relates to minimum wages, we're going to do what's right for our AutoZoners.  That's always been our philosophy inside the company. And so the cadence with which the legislation happens will have an impact on that. But across our business today, we're always focused on doing what's right for the AutoZoners and making sure that we're competitive in terms of acquiring labor. And so to the extent that there are changes that happen in the wage landscape, we're going to be competitive there, and we're going to have a business that enables us to be competitive in the future.\nWilliam Rhodes: All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take just a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress, like always, that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $2.9 billion, up 16%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q2 last year. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business. For the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 14.7% to $639 million. Sequentially, commercial growth was nearly three points higher than Q1. In the quarter, sales to our commercial customers represented 22% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $10,500, up 11.7%. We averaged $53 million in total weekly commercial sales. Internally, we have been executing against our commercial acceleration program where we are focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service, technology and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 45 net new programs, finishing with 5,088 total programs. And our sales efficiency per store remained at near-record levels as we leveraged our DIY infrastructure and increased our share of wallet with existing customers. Let me be clear, our strategy is working. We believe we grew share and we remain focused on repeating this for the balance of fiscal 2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts, improvements in our assortment and parts covered by model year, more competitive pricing and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past three quarters and position us well in the marketplace. And as we move forward, we are focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability. We opened one more Mega-Hub this quarter, bringing our total to 48 locations, and we expect to open between 7 and 10 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. Given the success of our Mega-Hubs and increasing parts availability and driving meaningful sales lift, we're now raising our target from 75 to 90 mega hubs at build-out to 100 into 110. These stores help us expand coverage and say, yes, we have it more frequently. Second, we are leveraging technology to improve delivery times and service levels. The technology investments we're making in electronic ordering and tracking will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. We're making it simpler to do business with AutoZone, and we're driving efficiency for our sales professionals and drivers. Third, we are committed to being price competitive. We have a laser focus on the key categories where investment and pricing lead to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. We like the competitive hand that we have in our commercial business and believe we are in the early innings of a transformational growth story. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our retail acceleration initiatives. We're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY share growth. Like the commercial initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are running an intense playbook in DIY that is driving solid results for our business. First, the assortment work and mega hubs strategy that I mentioned earlier drive tremendous benefits to our DIY business. Our investments are improving coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful impact on trial and repeat purchase activity. Second, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with the work we have done on the digital front. Our efforts in Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home have helped us meet customers win where and how they want to shop. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the customer experience and make it easier to shop our broad array of products. Third and similar to our commercial approach, we have a laser-like focus on being competitively priced in the marketplace. We're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to drive pricing decisions in certain categories, categories where we typically compete with non-traditional competitors like mass and online-only sellers in commodities and very slow-moving parts and products. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. This is a data-rich environment, and our tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. Again, we're living up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, and we believe it is helping us create a faster-growing business. Fourth, we simply have a relentless focus on execution. As Bill mentioned, our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have delivered exceptional results in a tough environment. As I said last quarter, perhaps the best investment we have made in our company is the investment in additional emergency time-off. In return, we continue to see our supply chain process record volume and our store AutoZoners handled record store traffic, while still delighting our customers. This focus on execution is a meaningful competitive advantage for us and we're winning in the marketplace. Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. First, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores to finish with 628 stores and our store sales accelerated sequentially. Like last quarter, the exchange rate again played a role in the U.S. dollar equivalent reported sales. The exchange rate finished the quarter at roughly 77% higher than last year's second quarter rate. That's 7% higher than last quarter's second rate. And as a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we're seeing signs of a turnaround in the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we opened one new store to finish with 46 stores this quarter. The Brazilian real continues to face headwinds and devalued roughly 25% for Q2 over last year. Long term, Brazil will be an important market for AutoZone and we will invest in a disciplined way. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 77 basis points. 37 basis points of margin headwind is due to higher supply chain costs, including a onetime benefit last year that did not repeat this year. The remaining 40 basis points came from our pricing initiatives, loyalty program and mix shift. As I discussed above, we're focused on competitive pricing that will drive top line and gross profit dollar gains. To be clear though, the industry's pricing remains rational, and overall, we still have pricing power. We have tested certain categories and taken action when we have the ability to drive both top line and gross profit dollar gains. This is a dynamic market and we remain disciplined in our approach. The strategy is working. We see our work translating into higher sales and profits, as evidenced by the transaction and share growth that Bill mentioned earlier. As we continue to refine our strategy over the next several quarters, we're planning for higher sales and gross profit dollars that outpace the drag from gross margin rate. This is a good outcome for our business as we're driving new customers and retention. All of the investments we are making suggest that we're growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. Again, our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Regarding operating expenses, our teams, particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses are up 12.5% versus last year's Q2. But included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $40 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses, which represented 4.2% of the overall SG&A growth. We believe our decision to provide emergency time-off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic was absolutely the right thing to do. As I said last quarter, this is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $482 million, up 18.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the last fiscal year's third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $46 million to $47 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $47.5 million in last year's third quarter. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion versus last year's Q2 ending balance of just under $5.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And long term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving to tax, our tax rate was 20.6% versus 17.7% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 265 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year, it benefited 412 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $346 million, up 15.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.2 million was lower by 4.1% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.93, up 20.5% over the prior year second quarter. Let me talk a few minutes about our cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $356 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $150 million over last year's Q2. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter versus $315 million last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was two times. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remained significantly higher than historical levels. We now have $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which approximately $830 million is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was flat versus Q2 last year. Inventory per store was $715,000 versus $713,000 last year and $702,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 2.8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $93,000 versus negative $41,000 last year and negative $99,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113% versus last year's Q2 of 105.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we restarted our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, began methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again. But we feel comfortable with our strategy and our execution. As I mentioned, we spent $900 million on stock repurchases, representing 752,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. This will enable us to grow our business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. So to wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and this gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill. Well, I mean, our approach on inflation, quite frankly, is to be disciplined. Where we see commodity price inflation, we have to be disciplined enough to take price to recover that. And that's something that we've done over time in the business. What we're seeing today is we don't see any material increases that have us concerned. But if we do, we will be disciplined to make sure that we're taking price to recover those bumps that we see from commodity pricing. So even in an environment where we're trying to be as surgical as we can about the pricing moves that we make, and as Bill said, we're taking price up and price down, where it makes sense for us to take pricing, we do have pricing power and we're disciplined enough to take price where we see commodity inflation. That's right. So as we said, we had about 77 basis points of deleverage this quarter. About 40% of that was related to supply chain costs, and the other roughly 40 basis points is the supply chain costs and the remainder is the initiatives that we talked about. And what I'll say about our outlook in the future is that we're going to continue to lean into the strategy that we have today, because in this environment, what we're seeing is it's working. We're getting top line. We're getting EBIT dollar growth, and we're going to lean into that as we move forward. So we won't be date-certain necessarily about when you'll see an inflection point, because we're in the early innings of this strategy and it's delivering for us. Yes. So the key with mega hubs is that, it increases the number of SKUs that we have available, and it enables us to say, yes, more. And so to the extent that we have that coverage and those parts available, that bodes well for us as we're going into our existing customers and our new customers. What I'll say about commercial is that we grew 15%. We grew significantly with locals and nationals.  But probably the one story that I want people to continue to focus on is that, we're underpenetrated. I mean, a 4% share gives us a tremendous opportunity to create a faster-growing business. So as we execute on this growth playbook that we talked about, we're seeing significant share gains. We're pleased with that execution in the marketplace.  And the mega hub strategy, the things that we're doing with technology, the fact that we're laser-focused on being competitively priced, all of these things give us an opportunity to create a faster-growing business and we're pretty excited about it. Yes. First of all, we believe there's going to be a market. And AutoZone is going to be a big player, just as we are today with the internal combustion engine. Our strategy is simple. We're just going to follow the consumer just like we've done in the past. We're not wed to internal combustion engine technology. We've significantly changed our assortment over time to reflect the latest technology. So this is not an accidental threat for us. We're operating from a position of strength. If you think about our business today, we're already supplying parts and supplies to the EV market, things like wiper blades. We have world-class capabilities in supply chain and merchandising. We have great relationships and partnerships with the OEMs who have a seat at the table today and can help us forecast the volumes and the timing of the market changes. And we have this tremendous retail footprint in commercial business that gives us distribution points.  So as we think about the parts and supplies that are at risk with electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, there will be offsets. I mean, there will be - clearly, there'll be some things that are at risk, but there will be offsets to those. And there'll be opportunities for us in both DIY and DIFM. So listen, despite what we see in headlines and announcements from the OEMs, we're a bit cautious because the market has some near-term challenges that we're watching closely.  First of all, consumer adoption is uncertain. We - roughly 2% of the market today and it's growing slowly. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, the charging infrastructure is not ready for prime time. The rapid charging stations need to be built out. It's going to be expensive. It's probably going to take some combination of public and private partnerships. The business model there has an uncertain path to profitability. And quite frankly, we think there's going to be some need for some pretty significant power grid investments. But we do believe there's going to be a market and we're going to be a player, and we're simply going to follow the consumer. Well, what we've said is that, we're going to take our free cash flow. And our number one priority has been and will continue to be to invest in our business in a disciplined way. The free cash flow that we generate inside the business gives us tremendous financial firepower to both invest in our business in a disciplined way and return significant amounts of cash to investors in the form of our repurchases currently. We've got tremendous confidence in that plan, and we're going to continue to execute as we finish out the balance of the year. Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is, we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that we've been contemplating for a while. The first thing I'll say is that, we've done a tremendous job inside of our operations, really driving productivity. And over time, what that's meant for us is that we have a highly productive workforce here that is delivering. And you can see that in this environment where we have accelerated sales growth, you're seeing us getting very decent leverage with our teams in the field. So that's one. The second thing is, the reality is that when there are inflationary pressures in the business, whether they're commodities or wages, you have to be disciplined as a company to make sure that you recover those. And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing. And we believe we're going to have that pricing power into the future. And then I think the third thing that stands out to me as it relates to minimum wages, we're going to do what's right for our AutoZoners.  That's always been our philosophy inside the company. And so the cadence with which the legislation happens will have an impact on that. But across our business today, we're always focused on doing what's right for the AutoZoners and making sure that we're competitive in terms of acquiring labor. And so to the extent that there are changes that happen in the wage landscape, we're going to be competitive there, and we're going to have a business that enables us to be competitive in the future."

Okay. Well, good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To start off this morning, I'll spend some time talking about our sales results, trends over the 12 weeks, merchandise categories that drove our performance, and any regional discrepancies. As I said in our press release this morning, we could not deliver the kind of results we had without the heroic efforts of our store and supply chain AutoZoners. While classified as essential workers, essential seems insufficient to describe their remarkable contributions to our company, our customers and our results. Our AutoZoners have really stepped up during the pandemic and been nothing short of exceptional. And our top priority remains being committed to providing all of our AutoZoners with a safe work environment. To be sure to, so they can help our customers. While Jamere, we'll talk more about this when he discusses the investments we've been making. I will say the additional Emergency Time Offer or ETO we offered is something we just knew was the right thing to do for our AutoZoners. Thank you AutoZoners again. Okay. Let's turn to our sales results. Our overall comp sales were up 15.2% this quarter, our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strongest quarter. With retail comps being slightly stronger than commercial, commercial came on strong at the end of the quarter and comps similarly to retail for the last four weeks. Let's review our sales cadence. We told you on our last call we ran an 8.8% comp for the last four weeks of Q1. In the first four weeks of this quarter. Our sales accelerated to a 10.7% comp. As the holidays arrived, we saw further acceleration, which was sustained for the balance of the quarter. We ran a 17.5% comp pretty consistently over the last eight weeks of the quarter. This quarter's traffic versus ticket growth was pretty close to split down the middle, although ticket was slightly stronger. It was encouraging us - for us to see sales, inflect upward starting in January with both ticket and traffic moving higher. Our ticket growth was stronger this quarter due to hard part sales mixing higher than what we experienced in the first quarter. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and well being of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow all the national, state and local mandates and ordinances, and have always kept close tabs on the CDC guidelines. We continue to require masks entering our facilities perform questionnaires of our team members and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing masks, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. And just last week, we announced that we would provide every AutoZoner with a $100 reward once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This is just the next logical step in our efforts to provide a safe, working and shopping environment. I continue to be inspired by our Board and our management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first. You see, our values and our culture have been in full force and effect over the last year in this pandemic. Addressing our supply chain, we've done a solid job with handling the extra demand, and our in-stock levels have continued to improve. To provide a little more color on industry drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we go further and further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits that ended last July. In the first week of January, over $100 billion of stimulus was distributed to Americans. The majority of these funds was for the onetime checks as part of the $600 billion stimulus package passed in late December. While smaller in size than the April disbursements, we did see our business pick up nicely, and our sales remained elevated throughout the remainder of the quarter. While we continue to be encouraged with the current selling environment, we feel any additional stimulus should lead to a strong sales environment. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country perform well, with the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others pretty consistently. Again, these markets, which represent just over 25% of our store base, were solid but not as strong as the remaining markets. For example, the spread in comp sales between these markets and the others was approximately 300 basis points for the quarter. We believe the separation was due to lingering effects of a mild winter last year and colder weather happening later this winter. But winter did come this year. Boy, did it? And the performance gap closed. So we are encouraged about the summertime and believe we won't have to discuss why mild winter affected comp sales during our upcoming fourth quarter. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the mid single-digit range, with our sales closer to three times, the industry's growth rate. While we are thrilled to have these share gains now, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the spring and summer months. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about sales for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the third fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have a much more difficult comparison in the fourth fiscal quarter as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package. For now, it remains difficult for us to predict sales for the remainder of the year. This is especially true for the fourth quarter of this year when we were up against the fourth quarter of previous year's 21.8% comp store sales growth. While we continue to expect our sales growth will moderate over time, we believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. Over the long term, if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, we reminded you the strongest periods we'd experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, 2001 and 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary environments. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retained many of those customers in the years that followed. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 15.2% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $346 million. And our EPS was $14.93 a share, 20.5% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 16% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 15%. For commercial, we averaged over $53 million in weekly sales, which was over $10,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter that is normal as the winter months are lower selling months for us. Moving forward, we remain very encouraged with what we are doing within our commercial business. The initiatives we have in place are helping our sales. I'll remind you that, this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there were some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales force categories continue to be strong, with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. In fact, our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This is the first quarter since the pandemic began where we saw our hard grow in line with sales force. Our business improved in many merchandize categories such as batteries, categories like brakes and rotors are not comping as high as the overall business. We believe this performance gap with certain categories will close as miles driven continue to improve. As for this year's winter, it was late arriving, but it did arrive. Overall, we view the winter as not having a material impact on our upcoming spring and summer business one way or the other. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. On last quarter's call, we announced we would be expensing additional payroll during the second quarter. The additional expense was to provide our AutoZoners with more emergency time-off. While this is the second time in our history, we've offered ETO benefits, we believe it is the least we could do to support our AutoZoners in the field. This extra time-off award has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. Our AutoZoners have the right to use the benefits to address medical emergencies, take time off to get the vaccine, take additional paid vacation time-off or wait until the end of the calendar year and get paid what remains in their incremental paid vacation bank. In January, we paid out $31 million to AutoZoners who didn't utilize the ETO we offered them back in March of 2020. I have to tell you, it was an honor to provide these AutoZoners with sizable checks in recognition of their heroic efforts. We feel this is a very important investment in our AutoZoners and in their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere, and I have to take a moment and recognize you. Your grasp of the fundamentals of this business in less than six months is extraordinary, and thank you for being here. We're so glad you joined the team. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times and they continue to require us to look at many things differently while managing our business day to day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team, across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets.  We are fortunate to have extraordinary people, who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. They've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far, but we must stay focused and we must continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate and we must continue to execute. Our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well. We understand trends will slow in the future. We're going to work. We're going to work as hard as possible to gain as much share as possible and limit our headwinds. And we continue to see a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. Our business continues to do very well and we are still in the early innings of growth. But as always, we have work to do as we head into our spring selling season. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and our customer's safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Well, thank you for the question, Michael. Yes, as you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades. We found some particular specific opportunities where we found places to invest and improve our value proposition to our customers. They're very specific pieces, both in the retail business and the commercial business. I don't know exactly what's going to happen a year from now. Our team is going to continue to innovate. We are constantly raising prices and we are constantly lowering prices, trying to find that sweet spot where our customers value - the value that they're getting the best. So I don't know exactly what it's going to be over the long term. But if you recap and what Jamere said, the gross margin, we had about 40 basis points, which was a onetime negative from last year. So, all the things that were embedded in there, of which price was one of them, accumulated to 40 basis points. Frankly, I'm not that smart to know what the gross margin is going to be within 40 basis points, two or three years from now. Yes. We talked, I guess, probably three years ago that we were embarking on a new commercial study, and we developed a new strategy that we began rolling out probably 18 months or so ago. And we're still in the early innings of rolling out that strategy. It has many different elements. I mean, this Hub and Mega-Hub portion of the strategy, which is taking years but it is making a meaningful difference, a very meaningful difference in our ability to say yes to our customers. And it's leaning towards commercial although, it's helping DIY tremendously as well. That's an element of it. We've rolled out new technology in our commercial business. Handheld technology, which allows us to be able to better understand what our delivery times are and manage our delivery times better. We're significantly already reduced our delivery times in the last six months, and we think we have more room to go. We've also enhanced our website, and our ability to communicate and be easy to do business with, with our commercial customers. So I don't think it's - and then, of course, the ongoing evolution and building of the Duralast brand. So it's not one individual issue. It's an amalgamation of all these different issues coming together and improving our competitive position. Not to mention, during the global pandemic and the stay at home and safe at home orders, we were there for our customers, every day. And that allowed us to introduce ourselves at a different level to some customers. And I think that has resulted in stickier long-term relationships. Yes. I would say a couple of things. First, as I said in our script, and it's pretty clear from the data that we have. The strategy is working. What we're seeing is the benefits of top line growth. We're seeing our share numbers go up. We're seeing strong traffic. We're seeing ticket. We're seeing unit growth, so all of the metrics point to the fact that the strategy is working. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing a ton of cost pressures that are material. And industry pricing remains rational. So what we're doing is part of this strategy is very surgical. In other words, we're not peanut butter-spreading, price declines across the business, but we're being very surgical using very sophisticated data and analytics. And those are the thing that give us a lot of confidence that what we're doing makes a lot of sense for the consumer and makes a lot of sense for us. So as we move forward, we're going to continue to lean into this strategy. And our approach is delivered in the marketplace. Listen, I - as I spent time over the last six months or so, I like the competitive hand that we have, if we can continue to delight our customers the way we have over the past year or so, and we live up to the pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, this will continue to be a win for our shareholders, and we're going to see the results in the bottom line of our business. Let me add to that for just a second, too. You mentioned loyalty. And we don't know what's going to happen to loyalty costs as we go forward. The reason our loyalty costs are up is because our customers are doing more repeat business with us. The biggest part of our growth is coming from existing customers returning to our stores more frequently. We are tickled to death with that. I hope it continues next year and is another pressure point because it means we're gaining additional share, and it's a very profitable share gain for us. Absolutely. And yes, you're right. There's a temporary - while people are locked down, our business suffers and suffers significantly, but when things warm up, our business rebounds immediately and for a sustained period of time. More importantly, those conditions put significant incremental wear and tear on certain under-car parts. And there's a lag effect that will typically last nine months or so for us. And it's something we were talking about before the pandemic. The fact that our business was expected to be soft last spring and summer because we had a mild winter. Well, when the pandemic hit, that changed everything. But this year, we shouldn't have to be talking about a mild winter dampening our results in the spring and summer. Yes, terrific question. And yes, you have to bifurcate it between what's going on in the retail sector versus what's going on in the commercial sector, both of which we're gaining share two times or three times - we're growing two times or three times faster than the industry growth rates by all indications we have. We have really good data on the retail share gains. We don't have as good a data but we can look at headline growth numbers in the commercial gains. On retail, we are picking up a lot of share from what's traditionally, we believe in the mass channel. I think a lot of people are not frequenting those large stores at the same rate that they did in the past. And what we're focused on is making sure, as we're getting those incremental visits, that we are going above and beyond so we get those visits in the future. I think also, as this brick-and-mortar omnichannel strategy comes to place, I think we're also not losing share that we might have been losing before to the online channel, and in fact, maybe gaining some of that share back over time. In the commercial sector, I think it's hard to say where the share is coming from. We are less than 4% market share in the commercial industry today. I think it's likely coming from probably multiple different places. We certainly have intensified our understanding of what the wholesale distributor market is doing, and we're paying more attention to them and our competitive analysis and building our strategy. And we think that over time, we've significantly changed our competitive position, particularly against the WDs. You think about what we've done with assortment, what we've done building a sales force and now we've got this technology that we have in place, it's going to improve our deliveries. I think that our competitive positioning in the marketplace is vastly different than what it was four, five years ago. Yes. Certainly, Bret. We've experienced significant supply chain disruptions over the last 11 months. Certainly a lot less today than we had, call it, June, July, August. I think I mentioned on one of these calls, we couldn't get sandpaper for a while. We had trouble with fuses. We had trouble with tools. I mean, we just had such enormous surges in certain parts of our business that we couldn't keep up, and many of those came with an extended supply chain that ran into China or Asia. We've worked through most of those. I have to give our team and our battery suppliers some kudos that the battery business has been as strong as it's been for as long as it's been. And then we had this huge cold surge or cold snap and we did just fine. Our team was very creative and worked with lots of different suppliers to make sure we were in good shape. So we don't have any acute needs right now. Some issues on the edges. Our in-stock position has significantly improved, but it's not back to our normal levels yet, probably going to take a few more months. That's a terrific question, Seth. I'm not sure how to answer it all. Clearly, I think we talked that we were worried. If anything, we might have pulled forward some battery business, because those cars parked last spring, and they sat for five or six weeks, as soon as the safe at home went away, our battery business boomed. But that battery business has sustained really high levels ever since. We've seen no dip in our battery business. We've seen weeks where we're going up against tough winter weather where it might be softer. But overall, it has exceeded our expectations over the last 11 months. As far as sustainability of these sales surges, the thing that keeps resonating with me is, if you think about our business over really long periods of time, when our customers have incremental time and specifically, incremental money, our business outperforms normal periods of time. And it's been that way for the last decade when we get tax refunds. How much have we talked in this environment about the surge we see during tax refund season, which is just beginning right now? We've seen it every single year. And when and when tax refunds moved back three weeks, we had to spend a lot of time talking about it because it moved out of one quarter into another quarter. It's just evidence that when our customer who are often term as financially fragile, when they get some incremental dollars, we seem to get a disproportionate share of those funds. And we saw it again in January when the stimulus came out. It wasn't nearly the stimulus that we saw last April, but within a day, within a day, we saw that those funds showing up in significantly improved business for us. And that sustained itself through the end of the quarter. Now we're talking about another stimulus, which could frankly, could dwarf what happened last April. If that comes, what does that mean to our business? All the indications we have is it would be very strong for our business because each time we've seen those incremental dollars our business has performed better than normal. Yes. I don't think the stimulus plays nearly as much in the commercial business as it does the DIY business. And I think most of the end consumers in the commercial business are higher socioeconomic - higher up on the socioeconomic ladder. So that incremental money doesn't mean as much to them. In fact, both businesses were doing really well. Commercial is continuing to rebound. But there are still elements of the commercial business that aren't as strong as they were pre-pandemic, particularly some of our national account players, the up and down the street business has been stronger than the national account business. And again, I think that, that has to do with the end consumer that is servicing or picking the UDS business versus picking the national account business. Yes. I don't think we've really seen any significant category shifts. I mentioned the battery business has been particularly strong. We've seen - we talked about the sales floor business being really strong. What we have seen in recent - in this quarter is a resurgence of our hard parts business, in particular, some of the failure-related items. I think some of that has to do with actually getting into winter and having a more normal winter this year. We've also talked about our maintenance products not being at the same levels that we're experiencing in the rest of our business, things like brakes and rotors and the like. And I think that, that's personally a hold on from the lack of winter last year, and the fact that miles driven are down and those maintenance items for some of the higher socioeconomic groups may be negatively impacted. There's a lot to unpack there, Mike. Thank you for the question. I really hate this new setup with Bill and Jamere. Used to if somebody said Bill and it was a hard question, I would just look at Giles and let him answer it. But you put it on me this time. So let's talk about our digital business. In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where our customer's really picking a channel, they're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are two primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buttons. And we fulfill it the exact same way regardless of how they initially interact with us. We've been doing a lot of work trying to make - doing it digitally with us, easier and we've made significant strides, really proud of the team that's been doing that work over the last couple of years, in particular. And we've also made a lot of other back office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone. We believe and hope over time that our percentage of digital penetration in the commercial business will continue to increase at a pretty rapid pace. On the retail side of the business, we kind of have three different businesses that we interact with. We have Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store. We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs, and customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day. Each one of those three businesses is growing significantly, really high rates faster than the rest of the business. But our Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store is growing at twice the rate of our ship to home and next-day delivery business. And that again shows us, once again - and remember, the way we price in the online world, if you do ship to home or next-day delivery, on most purchases, you can generally get a 20% discount. But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omni-channel provider. We've got to have great stores and great customer touch points, convenience and knowledge that our AutoZoners provide to our customers is very valuable to our customers. So I hope I unpacked that okay for you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take just a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress, like always, that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day and stay safe."

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer-elect; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late September, much of the world\u2019s intention remains focused on COVID-19, including its current and future implications for communities, businesses and markets. These times remain extraordinary for all of us. From the start of the pandemic through this quarter, our team has had to deal with challenges unlike any we have seen in our company\u2019s history. While at the start of the pandemic our sales dipped, we performed quite well once economic stimulus was implemented in the U.S. and Americans began to drive more. By mid-April, our business began to strengthen and reached an apex last quarter when we reported 21.8% same-store sales, the best same-store sales performance in our company\u2019s rich history. For this quarter, ending in late November, we are proud to report 12.3% same-store sales, another historically strong performance. While last quarter\u2019s sales were more consistent, particularly across the first 12 weeks of the 16-week quarter, this quarter was a bit less so. Considering the meaningful volatility resulting from the pandemic and economic responses, we are sharing our same-store sales cadence for equal-week period of the quarter. We were up 16.5%, then up 11.4%, ending up 8.8% in the last four weeks. The deceleration appears to be related to a combination of normal seasonality and how far away we work from the benefits of economic stimulus. This quarter\u2019s traffic was far more beneficial to same-store sales than ticket growth by quite a wide margin. When we talked in September, we could not have effectively forecasted our growth for this quarter\u2019s same-store sales, albeit we would have been much closer than we would have forecast in Q4 at the beginning of that quarter. We are continuing to learn as we go. In Q1, we felt we would see substantial above-normal growth, but we wouldn\u2019t have thought double-digit same-store sales. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to follow the myriad of national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs of the CDC guidelines. We require mask entering our facilities, perform questionnaires of our team and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing mask, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. Last quarter, we talked about the pressure our supply chain was experiencing to make sure we were in-stock and replenishing the stores on a timely basis. I\u2019m very happy to say, today, we feel we\u2019ve made significant progress in this area. Our in-stocks are much improved and our supply chain in most of our vendor partners have done an exceptional job reacting to the unprecedented surge in volumes that have now lasted six-plus months. The progress has been significant, but at the end of the quarter, we had only closed about half of the gap from our depths to our normal levels of in-stock. To provide a little more color on the drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I\u2019ll remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits. While the initial stimulus package ended at the end of July, there were still funds being distributed on a state-by-state basis at lower levels this fall. As you recall, last quarter we reported finishing the quarter with comp sales running up 16.5%. And you can see we remain strong for this quarter. While our enhanced sales growth declined over the quarter to still historically high levels, we believe the noise around the election, the reemergence of COVID in many areas and the beginnings of seasonal weather patterns hurt food traffic particularly in the last four-week period. While it remains extremely hard to predict sales performance in the near-term, we believe the fundamentals of our business remain quite strong. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, but all of our regions performed well. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales for customer segment data we have, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains, historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the high-single digits and our sales have been growing at close to double that rate for these categories. While we are thrilled to have these share gains today, our charge is to determine how we maintain them. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2021. I\u2019ll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There are simply too many remaining unknowns, like will the Federal Government pass the second round of stimulus? And when will the vaccine be distributed? And how effective will it be? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which ones have changed permanently? All of this creates uncertainty. But our focus on execution remains the same. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. For the long-term, we\u2019ve remained bullish on the health of our industry. And as the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks the strongest periods we experienced of outsized sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001-2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of these outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that followed. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we\u2019ve retained many of those customers in the years that followed. I would be remiss if I did not thank our AutoZoners for their exceptional efforts. While I\u2019ll praise our entire organization from our stores to our distribution centers, from the U.S. to Mexico to Brazil at all data and our store support teams, I always owe our thanks to our customers who continue to believe in our capabilities to help them with their automotive needs. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our team. As usual, I want to especially recognize on behalf of every AutoZoner our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been challenged more than they ever could have expected, and they have met every single challenge. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner, and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every day. Now let\u2019s move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 12.3% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our net income was $442 million, and our EPS was $18.61 a share, 30.1% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 13% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 12%. In commercial, we averaged over $58 million in weekly sales, which was over $11,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as we change seasons. Moving forward, we expect our commercial business to show continued strength as we execute on our growth initiatives and gain additional share in this space. I\u2019ll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there are some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong as we believe people have more time and many have more money. Many parts of the economy are still operating at fractions of their normal capacity: movie theaters, vacation resorts, entertainment venues, hotels and the like. Some Americans have the luxury to, \u201cwork-from-home\u201d, eliminating their commute, and unfortunately, while vastly improved from the early days of the pandemic, unemployment is still twice the pre-pandemic rate. This extra time and for some, extra funds, have been repurposed for that project car or doing that enhancement job our customers have been perpetually putting off. At the same time, while our sales have increased in merchandise categories like brakes, rotors and even motor oil, they aren\u2019t growing as fast as the rest of the categories due to last year\u2019s mild winter and lower current miles driven. We believe miles driven will continue to improve and maintenance parts will increase as miles driven go up. And we know from history that the muted brake and rotor growth is also still being impacted by last year\u2019s very mild winter. As for this year\u2019s winter, all indications we have call for a normal winter. Anything, anything normal in this environment will be welcomed. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. One thing we are certain of is our team continues to perform at an exceptional level. I\u2019m so proud of them across the enterprise. We remain focused on providing everyone with the support, encouragement and resources they need to live up to our pledge of always putting customers first. Now I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. In particular, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions of our store and distribution center AutoZoners and their leaders who have been there for our customers, external or internal, every day since the beginning of the pandemic. I ask each of you listening to this call to stop for a moment and imagine yourself in a public environment five-plus days a week for the last nine months, helping customers while at the same time trying to keep yourself, your teammates, your customers and ultimately your own family safe from the virus. Seriously, seriously stop and think about that. That is exactly what our team has done. Our stores haven\u2019t closed. Our distribution centers are operating at breakneck speed. Thanks to these AutoZoners at our stores and distribution centers for all they\u2019ve done. In the spring, we implemented something innovative and new for all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners and ultimately for our store managers and DC advisors. We offered them emergency-time off or ETO as we call it. In essence, it amounted to two extra weeks of vacation to give them the flexibility to ensure their safety, deal with childcare issues, care for a sick family member or most importantly, stay home, stay home if they were showing any symptoms. It is worth and it\u2019s worked exceptionally well. Many of them have used this benefit while a significant portion have saved it and will receive meaningful payouts should they choose next month, an $800 to $1,600 or more bonus for most of our hourly AutoZoners. When we rolled this new benefit out, as you would expect, we shared that it was a one-time extraordinary benefit. Who knew then that the pandemic would still be racing at the turn of the calendar year? So two weeks ago, we announced our team that we would allow them to carry over any unused ETO or be paid out in January at their election, that every single AutoZoner who has unused normal vacation would be allowed to carry it over six months past the normal deadline. And most importantly, that we would be extending all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners, store managers and DC advisors in the U.S. with another week of ETO at the beginning of the new calendar year. This is an expense that will be recognized in our second quarter of approximately $50 million. And as I\u2019ve told our AutoZoners on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving when I made the announcement, it\u2019s a large expense, but is more importantly a tremendous investment in them and their safety. I\u2019m exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?\nWilliam Giles: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 13.1%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,960,000. This compares to $1,865,000 in Q1 last year. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. For the first quarter, our domestic do-it-for-me or DIFM sales increased 11.9% to $695 million, another strong quarter for us. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 22% of our total sales and increased approximately $75 million from last year\u2019s Q1. Our weekly sales per program were $11,500, up 9.2% on a per-program basis versus $10,600 per week last year. Not only was $11,500 per week the second highest average ever for us, but we were able to average $58 million in total weekly commercial sales, another near record and a tremendous accomplishment for our teams. As you know, commercial sales is an important growth initiative for us, and we are investing in a disciplined way to create a faster growing business. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores. This year, we have opened 36 net new programs, finishing with 5,043 total programs as our sales efficiency per store remains at near-record levels. Let me give a little more color on our success in commercial and the growth playbook as we move forward. This past year, we believe we grew share and remain focused on repeating this for FY2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts offering, many in the Duralast brand, improvements in our parts coverage by model year and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past two quarters and position us well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we are focused on several initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiatives by adding MegaHub locations. We opened three new MegaHubs this quarter, bringing our total to 47. These stores substantially increase local market availability, and we see a meaningful lift in sales in the markets where they opened. With over 80,000 SKUs or more, we deliver same day and often multiple times per day to stores in MegaHub markets. This means a store can say, yes, we have it significantly more than when they are sourced from a hub that carries 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs. Second, we are improving our service continually by upgrading service levels with our parts professionals and drivers. We are delivering faster, and we are supporting our customers with overall needs better than before. We recently implemented chainwide to the U.S. technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, using our one team approach, we have further integrated our commercial business at our stores where we offer programs. This means that store management and the entire team is focused on driving sales and improving service to our commercial customers. And fourth, we continue to invest in disciplined way in initiatives that make us more competitive in the marketplace and much easier to do business with. We like our growth prospects in commercial and believe our growth initiatives will help us create a faster growing AutoZone. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won\u2019t repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID\u2019s effect on customers\u2019 ability to get out and shop grew, we\u2019ve ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter, we continued to see very strong growth in our buy online, pick-up in-store shopping channel. While our other two options, next day delivery and ship-to-home were also up nicely, our buy online, pick-up in-store offering continued its rapid growth. Pick-up in-store grew faster than our ship-to-home option as customers continue to value interaction with our experienced in-store advisors. While our online sales remain less than 5% of our DIY business, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pick-up. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 20.6 to the dollar and was roughly 6% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter rate. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. During the quarter, we did not open any new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we are seeing signs of a turnaround with the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedule in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 45 stores. We opened two new stores in the quarter. Like the U.S. and Mexico, Brazil faced challenges with COVID-19, stay-at-home mandates and foreign exchange headwinds. The Brazilian real devalued roughly 30% for Q1 year-over-year. We view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing the Brazilian business has not wavered. Now I\u2019ll pass it off to our CFO-elect and the new member of our team, Jamere Jackson, to take us through additional P&L items and our cash flow and balance sheet highlights. But before I do, I would like to personally welcome Jamere to our team. We are also excited to have him here. He has done a very quick study and we all look forward to his valuable contributions for many years to come. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill. And let me first say how delighted I am to join AutoZone at this point in my career and the company\u2019s rich history. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you, and I\u2019m so grateful for the opportunity to lead the world-class Finance & Store Development teams that you\u2019ve built over the years. I\u2019m also fortunate that you\u2019re running through the tape to use a sports analogy which has enabled me to spend valuable time in our stores and distribution centers and learn the business from the ground up. Your track record of building shareholder value as CFO of this company has been impressive. Certainly, not many CFOs post the kind of numbers that you put on the board during your tenure. I wish you enjoy all the best as you write the next chapter. Let me begin on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 62 basis points. I would categorize the drivers in three buckets. About a third of the pressure is the result of one-time markdowns on COVID-related goods such as hand sanitizer, where we saw a significant slowdown in sales velocity as we moved through the quarter. Another third of the pressure is the result of higher loyalty transactions. As our transaction counts have been up materially the last two quarters, we simply have issued more $20 credits to customers. This has translated into higher sales and profits, but slightly lower margins. Given the share gains we have seen as evidenced by the high single-digit transaction growth that Bill Rhodes mentioned earlier, we are planning for this headwind on gross margins to remain in future quarters. Now, this is a good outcome for our business as we are driving new customers and retention. The remainder of the deleverage was driven primarily by mix and some pricing investments we are making in select merchandise categories to improve our competitive positioning. Our industry remains extremely rational when it comes to pricing. All of the investments we are making suggest that we are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we are committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. Regarding operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, continue to manage our expenses well during these times. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year\u2019s Q1 due to our very strong sales results, and we\u2019re able to leverage operating expenses 222 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were approximately $5.2 million related to emergency-time off and other COVID-related expenses. We believe there will be long-lasting benefits from our decision to provide emergency-time off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic. This is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to EBIT. EBIT for the quarter was $615 million, up 23% versus the prior year. Our EBIT margin was 19.5%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 5.6% from Q1 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in last year\u2019s third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $47 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $44.3 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in Q2 is driven by the same reasons noted for Q1. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion or approximately $228 million above last year\u2019s Q1 ending balance of just under $5.3 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and long-term share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.2% versus 23.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 134 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 33 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $442 million, up 26.3% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.8 million shares was lower by 2.9% from last year\u2019s quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $18.61, up 30.1% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Now I\u2019ll move to cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $683 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $236 million over last year\u2019s Q1. Our operating cash flow results were driven by the exceptionally strong earnings that Bill mentioned earlier and working capital. Net fixed assets were up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113 million and reflected the spending to open 41 net new stores this quarter, investments in existing stores, hubs and MegaHubs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,924 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 45 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,590. For fiscal year 2021, we expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic stores and roughly 50 international stores. Depreciation totaled $89.6 million in the quarter versus last year\u2019s expense of $89.7 million. We repurchased $678 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $450 million last year. At quarter end, we had $117.6 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remain significantly higher than historical levels. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.5 billion is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong as we have both a multiyear and a 364-day credit facility totaling $2.75 billion that remains untapped. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 1.2% versus Q1 last year. Inventory per store was $702,000 versus $694,000 last year and $683,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was negative $99,000 versus negative $71,000 last year and negative $104,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114.1% versus last quarter\u2019s Q1 of 110.3%. Now let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. This past quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program. As we mentioned on our last quarter\u2019s call, we expected to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buyback stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near-term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again, but we feel comfortable with our ongoing strategy. This past quarter, we spent $678 million on stock repurchases, representing 584,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such expect to systematically reduce the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year and return meaningful and historically unprecedented amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. To wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by, first, investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. I\u2019ll remind you that our business remains remarkably resilient through the cycles, and the investments we are making today in our products and services position us well in the near and long-term. Let me give you just a few initial impressions of my short time here in the CFO chair. This is a tremendous business with an incredibly bright future. We have a world-class leadership team with deep domain expertise and a passion for winning in the marketplace. I have experienced first-hand the dedication and heroic actions of our AutoZoners in the stores and distribution centers, and as a long-time customer, I know that they are the reason why we are delivering exceptional results. And finally, our execution on our growth initiatives give me great confidence in our ability to grow our business and build tremendous value for our shareholders. Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere and welcome. These continue to be unique and abnormal times, and they require us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I\u2019m extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. Our operating theme this year is AutoZone is strong, and I\u2019m honored to say we have come together this year to live this theme like never before. While it\u2019s impossible for us to know what the cadence of the new year sales will be, I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. While our domestic retail business continues to do very well, we understand trends will slow in the future. But we believe we have a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. While we understand these things, we also feel we are well positioned for continued future share gain opportunities across all the business segments we operate. Our business continues to do very well, but as always we have work to do as we start calendar 2021. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows will look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on AutoZone. Before we proceed to Q&A, I want to take the liberty to publicly thank two exceptional leaders. Over 37 years ago, Bill Hackney followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and joined this extraordinary enterprise. And over those 37-plus years, Bill leveraged his knowledge of virtually every part of this business and his deep understanding of our customers to our and our customers\u2019 benefit. He will be missed. And almost 15 years ago, Bill Giles traded home goods for auto parts, and boy, weren\u2019t we fortunate. I\u2019ve had the honor to partner with Bill ever since he joined the company. How many CEOs have the privilege to host 59 consecutive earnings release calls with the same world-class CFO. Bill has been a great team member and advisor for our entire organization, and we thank you, Bill. While we will miss both of them, as our Founder\u2019s father J.R. Hyde Jr., often said, \u201cNo individual builds a business, they build an organization, and the organization builds the business\u201d. Both of these AutoZoners for life have embraced that mentality and built tremendous teams. We wish you and your families the best of luck in your next chapter and thank you for all you\u2019ve done for each of us. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Bret Jordan with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: I guess a little more follow-up on the market share gains. It seems like the second quarter you guys have been picking share up. Could you maybe give us some color both on the commercial and DIY side? Where you're seeing the share donors? And I guess the follow-up question would really be on sustainability. If you're picking up share from WDs given your higher in-stocks, do you see that share sustaining in the sense that those customers stay with you as the WD bring inventory backup? I guess, is your position higher on the call list relatively defensible? Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you for the question Bret. On the commercial side of the business, you've seen the publicly available numbers and I think first of all, we're at the top of the heap in both the retail and commercial businesses with our public peers. So I think we're doing very well there. Regarding your specific question on WDs, clearly during the worst of times back in Q3, we were in a very different position than some of our smaller competitors. They really shut things down, many of them closed or work reduced hours had less inventory and the like. And I think that that gave us a real opportunity to introduce ourselves and be there for certain customers, that maybe we didn't have the same relationship before. As we've said many, many times the commercial part of this business certainly is a relationship business. And when you're there for customers, you build up some credibility that you can leverage for a long time. So I think that's the bigger issue rather than them getting back to where their normal operating procedures are, that we were there in people's times of need. And I think that people have long memories about that. On the retail side of the business, again, I think we're performing at the highest level of any of our public peers. But I also think that there are other parts of the channel, other channels in the retail sector, mass and online that we did particularly well against during this period of time and continue to do so. Again, I think, is it sustainable or not? That's the biggest charge that we have as a management team. We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to new customers. And as we said in our prepared remarks, much of our business growth in the retail business is coming from existing customers who are doing more business with us. And I think it's very encouraging that we're \u2013 they're participating with us in different categories than they normally do. And so we feel very good about that.\nBret Jordan: Yes. On the DIFM, on the commercial side, I guess the WDs historically had strong relationships, but might not have had inventory at a point in time. And I guess as their inventory balance has come back up, I guess my real question is, do you see any shift in the cadence of your share gains? Or the WD is becoming more effective competitors or you really holding all of the share that you picked up in the downturn?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. I wish I had better information to answer that question, Bret. We have very specific information on the sales floor categories in our retail business. We don't have that level of information on the commercial business. So we have to \u2013 like everybody else look pretty much at the topline numbers and try to extrapolate from there, but we feel like we're doing well. I can't tell you how the WDs are doing as a whole.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And I wish Bill Giles a good send-off again. I think we did it last quarter, but there was a nice message from Bill Rhodes. My first question is on price. I think we've talked about investing in price a little more prominently in the last couple of quarters. Can we talk about the rationale? Any specific areas you're trying to address? Is it price spreads online? Is it DIY, DIFM? And then can you talk big picture around the elasticity of demand? I'm assuming it's not for short-term gains because a lot of the demand is failure base, but how do you think about that?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. This is Jamere. What I'll say is a couple of things. First of all, we control our own destiny here. In the results, as it relates to our gross margins, are not a result of cost pressures or pricing spirals within the industry. What we're doing is, we're investing in a disciplined way to improve our competitive positioning. We're improving our overall profitability. And in many ways the productivity we're achieving in operating expenses serves as a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making. What I'll say about pricing is that we're making decisions on pricing, merchandising and investments based on data and discipline. And these are decisions that are resulting in both share gains and higher overall earnings. So I like the playbook that we have as it relates to the pricing.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks for that. Let me ask maybe a follow-up on stock buyback. I think you mentioned, you may exceed, I guess historic levels. And I think the last amount that you purchased was something in the $2 billion category or $2 billion level on a peak basis. So I mean, is there any way are you planning to eclipse that target? And then, would you take up your leverage short-term? Would it have any impact vis-\u00e0-vis the rating agencies? Can you take your leverage up to buyback an outsized amount?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So let me say this. I mean, this is perhaps one of the most powerful free cash flow stories really in all of industry. And the business model that we have enables us to invest in a disciplined way in growth and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in a very consistent and efficient way. And so what we recognized is that, this model is powerful enough from a cash flow standpoint for us to do that investment in a growth of our business and continue along the journey that we've been, returning meaningful amounts of cash and what the free cash flow that we generate. So we don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of leverage and we also don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of moving off the center line that we have for this disciplined capital allocation strategy.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I think Bill, the trade from home furnishings to AutoZone is definitely the trade of the century coming to this organization from Linens N' Things, so congratulations, again. So my question \u2013 two questions. So first on the do-it-for-me side of the business. Your annual run rate is now 600,000 per program per year. A couple of years ago you were sub 500. And so you look at your peers there in this 800-plus type range. I guess how do you think about getting to that level? Do you think that the service changes, the parts availability changes, the MegaHub strategy and the delivery strategy are sufficient to sort of keep step functioning up to that level of productivity?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Chris, thank you for the question. A lot of attention gets focused on our close end competitors and rightfully so, and they both outperform us on a sales per program basis and have for a long time. I'm really pleased with what our team has been able to do to begin closing that gap. But we really don't want to get too focused on our close end competitors. We want to think about the industry as a whole. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's a $75 billion market. It is incredibly fragmented, much more so fragmented than the retail side of the business. So I want to make sure that we're focused on the entire market, not our close end competitors. If you look back over the history of time, what our team has been able to do has really helped us as you've noted, accelerate our growth in a significant way. We've vastly improved our inventory assortments in every individual store, particularly as it relates to commercial oriented vehicles. We have this hub and MegaHub strategy, which we are rolling out and continue to outperform, particularly the MegaHubs. Every time we talk about the MegaHubs, we talk about that they have outperformed our expectations. We now have built this fabulous brand called the Duralast brand, which five to seven years ago, people thought it was an inhibitor to our success. Now, everybody else sees it as a real key part and a leverage point for us in the commercial business. Think about the other national brands at a decade ago were so powerful. Many of them are gone. Those that are still around are less relevant today than they were back then. And now we've also built this really strong salesforce, which we didn't have a decade ago. We're now supplementing all of that with some technology tools that are some of the largest investments that we've made in technology to make our teams more efficient and improve our delivery and reliability. So we're very bullish on what the future is and frankly, pretty proud of the progress that we've made today.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then in terms of the last four weeks of the quarter, you talked about roughly, an 8.8% in the last four weeks. Some of your peers have talked about disruption in the election week. I was just curious you mentioned that if we took out the election week, would it suggest that, maybe the underlying trend rate is better than that 8.8%. And I'll ask just because we should ask any commentary on what you're seeing so far this quarter?\nWilliam Rhodes: Perfect. Chris, thanks for getting that normal question in another way. I'll answer it the normal way because we released our earnings so quick in the quarter, so we're two weeks and three days into this quarter. We don't want to talk about what's happening this quarter because we don't want our owners to get focused on two and a half week periods of time. So historically, we have not talked about what's happened inter quarter and we're not going to do that today. We were very specific in showing you what happened in each four-week period during the quarter. We don't generally give that level of clarity either. I want to remind us coming into Q4 that we told you we were up 16.5% in the last four weeks of last quarter. I told you today that we were up 16.5%, the first four-week period. I think a lot of people thought our sales had gone down materially in September, and that wasn't true. Regarding that 8.8 that we had in the last four-week period of time. We were very intentional in saying, yes, the election was going on. We also \u2013 in this period of time, sales are driven up and down based upon weather patterns. We get a cold snap, it can be very positive. We get very rainy weather, it can be very negative. So we've given you the cadence. It's very hard for us to talk about and even understand what the next 12 weeks is going to be like, we don't know. These are unprecedented levels. 12.3% same-store sales is the best performance in this company since I\u2019ve joined the company over 26 years ago. It will slow down over time. How fast that happened? I don't know. But I do know we have an incredibly strong business that regardless will continue to outperform over the long-term.\nChristopher Horvers: Awesome. Thanks very much. And have a great holiday season.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill and Jamere, congratulations and best of luck to you both. Bill Rhodes in your prepared remarks, you pointed out that during the last 30 years or so, the best \u2013 the periods of strongest growth for the industry have been in during times of recession. And subsequently the year after the industry still didn't come negative, do you think this time is different because what's been driving the industry has been some of the discretionary categories rather than the strengths in maintenance and failure, like happened last time. Because there's a perception out there that the DIY business is going to give back a lot of what it's gained this year, when consumers get back out and do what they've been doing previously and because of AutoZone mix of business, it will have \u2013 it'll be the most sensitive to softness in the DIY segment whenever that happened?\nWilliam Rhodes: Well. Really terrific question, Michael. Yes, this time is different. There's no question about it. I\u2019ve said it \u2013 I\u2019ve just said it. This is the second best quarter since I've been at the company. The best quarter was last quarter. Will we be able to comp 21.8% same-store sales in Q4? I highly doubt it. Will we give some of that back? Absolutely. The question is, will we give it all back? Are we introducing ourselves to new customers? Or introducing existing customers to new categories for us? Are we kind of standing in that gap for customers? I think we are. And I think we're going to build loyalty with our customers over the long-term. My real question for us is if we had this pandemic, what would our sales have been two years from now? I'm sorry, there's a train outside of the room. If we had this pandemic and you moved forward two years from now and we have 2%, 3%, 4% increase in business that we would have had the pandemic not happen. I think that's a distinct possibility. And if we do, I think we'd be very pleased with that.\nMichael Lasser: Got it. The train is a good euphemism for suggesting that. AutoZone is going to keep chugging along. So that's helpful.\nWilliam Rhodes: You are always good at those kinds of things, Michael. It is light and it's not a train usually.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. The follow-up is on the gross margin. So it's been down two quarters in a row. There's a perception that this might be the beginning of a longer-term trend, particularly if AutoZone chooses to use some of the flexibility it has on the SG&A side to go and reinvest that into the price or other gross margin driving initiatives. So a), is that true? And b), there's a lot of well-documented pressure on labor, so do you lose some of the flexibility? Or do you foresee losing the flexibility if we treat some other factors that are driving your cost of labor, hurt that side of your P&L? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Giles: I would just jump in and say that look from a gross perspective, it's down two quarters in a row, but frankly, a big chunk of this one was one-time. So you've got a little bit of pressure on some of the things that Jamere pointed out, for example, on loyalty. That's a great example of the fact that to follow on what Bill was talking about, is that we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore we're seeing a tremendous amount of new and existing customers. Our existing customers are visiting us more and they're building up more loyalty points. That's fantastic. As we talk about pricing and think about pricing and we're going to be incredibly surgical about it. As Jamere said, it's going to be very data-driven. And at the end of the day, this is about driving gross profit dollars. Ultimately that is what we are most focused on is driving dollars. And as you can see, we're improving operating margin overall because we're leveraging our fixed cost structure based on the sales that we are generating from all of our activities and pricing is just a small example of one of those activities. But I think overall, the way I think about it is, look, I think our gross margin is very healthy. I think it's completely in our control. We have opportunities to improve and reduce our cost through importing, increasing our importing, lowering our acquisition cost. And as Jamere pointed out, we have an opportunity to be surgical about how we price. And so I think there's a lot of pluses and minuses in gross margin. And right now, they're all working to drive sales and drive profits.\nJamere Jackson: And the only thing I'll add is, you've talked a little bit about operating expenses and wage pressure. You saw this last quarter, our teams did an outstanding job of really driving productivity and we run the productivity play with intensity inside the company, and we've been able to manage our labor costs sort of in line with volume. There will be pockets of wage pressure, as you mentioned in certain regions, but quite frankly, we're committed to investing in our AutoZoners regardless of what happens with the regulatory environment. And quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're so good at driving productivity inside of the company. So again, we control our own destiny as it relates to these things and we're going to invest in a disciplined way to move the needle on earnings as a whole.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thank you so much and good luck.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew McClintock with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\nMatthew McClintock: Hi. Thanks, everyone. And honestly amazing results, so I don't even know what to say. Good job guys. The whole team\u2026\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you.\nMatthew McClintock: Jamere also welcome. Really happy to have you. I can't wait for you to talk more because honestly, this is a great company. So you made a good choice to be honest with you. So at end of the day, my biggest question here is, end of the day, I'm trying to think about your commercial growth was pretty outstanding this quarter and vehicle miles driven is still negative. And I'm trying to think through this because end of the day, are you trying to say that people now are coming back to work? The professionals that normally would go to mechanics are coming back to work and that's why they're starting to go to mechanics. And that's why the commercial business is good or end of the day, the exit rate of what your commercial business is doing right now. Should be pretty higher than what it is right now, if vehicle miles driven increases. So that's kind of \u2013 anything you can say toward that would be very helpful? How you think about the commercial business and the growth you did this quarter given that honestly, it should get better from here?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes. Another fantastic question. Thank you. As you look at the commercial business, you're exactly right, that miles driven are down and they\u2019ve been down for a period of time. I would also tell you that another thing that's muting the commercial business is the lack of winter that we had last year. Tire sales were down. Maintenance sales were down, brakes, rotors, which I\u2019ve talked about specifically in the prepared remarks. The other thing that's happening in that sector is the independent part of the sector is performing much better today than the national accounts, if you will. And I think those things will change over time. As you see, we get back into a normal weather pattern, but again, we're having this opportunity to introduce ourselves, particularly to some of these up and down the street accounts at a different level than we have on the past. I don't believe that people are \u201creturning to work\u201d. We don't see it yet in a significant miles driven improvement. It improved vastly in the summertime, but then it's kind of been fairly steady over the recent months we've seen. But I\u2019ll remind you that not all miles driven are the same. So people that are driving to work in some of these urban cores, generally aren't our core customer. Our core customer has not had the luxury just like our AutoZoners that are in the stores and the distribution centers. Our core customer doesn't have the luxury to work from home. They're doing manual labor. They're providing service economy kind of jobs. And so I don't think that our core customers really seen a significant change in their driving behaviors.\nMatthew McClintock: So if I could follow-up on that and just ask this question, just because you've made so many investments in the commercial business, and I agree you guys are very good in DIY, right? But because you made so much investment in the commercial business over the years, isn't that a sticky business? And doesn\u2019t that kind of imply that next year? The comparisons aren't that difficult because once somebody goes to you, they kind of don't go back. Is that a fair way to think about this?\nWilliam Rhodes: I think it's a very fair way to think about it. And I'll just remind you, when we got serious about the commercial business was 2008. We were doing about $750 million annually at that point in time. In the last 12 years, we've more than tripled the business, getting close to quadruple in the business. And it's been pretty darn sticky along the way. That's certainly our hope. And as we're launching many of these new initiatives that are only going to amplify our service advantage, as we've now shored up our inventory assortments, we\u2019ve built this brand and we've got somebody telling our story and our salesforce, we feel pretty good about the future. Will it be a straight line? No, it never is. But we've had a pretty strong trajectory over the last 12 years of growing that business much faster than the industry has grown.\nMatthew McClintock: Look, guys, I really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Rhodes: All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call, a very happy and most important, a healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And let me first say how delighted I am to join AutoZone at this point in my career and the company's rich history. It's been a pleasure working with you, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to lead the world-class Finance & Store Development teams that you've built over the years. I'm also fortunate that you're running through the tape to use a sports analogy which has enabled me to spend valuable time in our stores and distribution centers and learn the business from the ground up. Your track record of building shareholder value as CFO of this company has been impressive. Certainly, not many CFOs post the kind of numbers that you put on the board during your tenure. I wish you enjoy all the best as you write the next chapter. Let me begin on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 62 basis points. I would categorize the drivers in three buckets. About a third of the pressure is the result of one-time markdowns on COVID-related goods such as hand sanitizer, where we saw a significant slowdown in sales velocity as we moved through the quarter. Another third of the pressure is the result of higher loyalty transactions. As our transaction counts have been up materially the last two quarters, we simply have issued more $20 credits to customers. This has translated into higher sales and profits, but slightly lower margins. Given the share gains we have seen as evidenced by the high single-digit transaction growth that Bill Rhodes mentioned earlier, we are planning for this headwind on gross margins to remain in future quarters. Now, this is a good outcome for our business as we are driving new customers and retention. The remainder of the deleverage was driven primarily by mix and some pricing investments we are making in select merchandise categories to improve our competitive positioning. Our industry remains extremely rational when it comes to pricing. All of the investments we are making suggest that we are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we are committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. Regarding operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, continue to manage our expenses well during these times. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year's Q1 due to our very strong sales results, and we're able to leverage operating expenses 222 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $5.2 million related to emergency-time off and other COVID-related expenses. We believe there will be long-lasting benefits from our decision to provide emergency-time off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic. This is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to EBIT. EBIT for the quarter was $615 million, up 23% versus the prior year. Our EBIT margin was 19.5%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 5.6% from Q1 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in last year's third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $47 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $44.3 million in last year's second quarter. The increase in Q2 is driven by the same reasons noted for Q1. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion or approximately $228 million above last year's Q1 ending balance of just under $5.3 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and long-term share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.2% versus 23.2% in last year's first quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 134 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 33 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $442 million, up 26.3% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.8 million shares was lower by 2.9% from last year's quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $18.61, up 30.1% over the prior year's first quarter. Now I'll move to cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $683 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $236 million over last year's Q1. Our operating cash flow results were driven by the exceptionally strong earnings that Bill mentioned earlier and working capital. Net fixed assets were up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113 million and reflected the spending to open 41 net new stores this quarter, investments in existing stores, hubs and MegaHubs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,924 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 45 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,590. For fiscal year 2021, we expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic stores and roughly 50 international stores. Depreciation totaled $89.6 million in the quarter versus last year's expense of $89.7 million. We repurchased $678 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $450 million last year. At quarter end, we had $117.6 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remain significantly higher than historical levels. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.5 billion is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong as we have both a multiyear and a 364-day credit facility totaling $2.75 billion that remains untapped. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 1.2% versus Q1 last year. Inventory per store was $702,000 versus $694,000 last year and $683,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was negative $99,000 versus negative $71,000 last year and negative $104,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114.1% versus last quarter's Q1 of 110.3%. Now let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. This past quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program. As we mentioned on our last quarter's call, we expected to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buyback stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near-term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again, but we feel comfortable with our ongoing strategy. This past quarter, we spent $678 million on stock repurchases, representing 584,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such expect to systematically reduce the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year and return meaningful and historically unprecedented amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. To wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by, first, investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. I'll remind you that our business remains remarkably resilient through the cycles, and the investments we are making today in our products and services position us well in the near and long-term. Let me give you just a few initial impressions of my short time here in the CFO chair. This is a tremendous business with an incredibly bright future. We have a world-class leadership team with deep domain expertise and a passion for winning in the marketplace. I have experienced first-hand the dedication and heroic actions of our AutoZoners in the stores and distribution centers, and as a long-time customer, I know that they are the reason why we are delivering exceptional results. And finally, our execution on our growth initiatives give me great confidence in our ability to grow our business and build tremendous value for our shareholders. Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Yes. This is Jamere. What I'll say is a couple of things. First of all, we control our own destiny here. In the results, as it relates to our gross margins, are not a result of cost pressures or pricing spirals within the industry. What we're doing is, we're investing in a disciplined way to improve our competitive positioning. We're improving our overall profitability. And in many ways the productivity we're achieving in operating expenses serves as a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making. What I'll say about pricing is that we're making decisions on pricing, merchandising and investments based on data and discipline. And these are decisions that are resulting in both share gains and higher overall earnings. So I like the playbook that we have as it relates to the pricing. Yes. So let me say this. I mean, this is perhaps one of the most powerful free cash flow stories really in all of industry. And the business model that we have enables us to invest in a disciplined way in growth and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in a very consistent and efficient way. And so what we recognized is that, this model is powerful enough from a cash flow standpoint for us to do that investment in a growth of our business and continue along the journey that we've been, returning meaningful amounts of cash and what the free cash flow that we generate. So we don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of leverage and we also don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of moving off the center line that we have for this disciplined capital allocation strategy. And the only thing I'll add is, you've talked a little bit about operating expenses and wage pressure. You saw this last quarter, our teams did an outstanding job of really driving productivity and we run the productivity play with intensity inside the company, and we've been able to manage our labor costs sort of in line with volume. There will be pockets of wage pressure, as you mentioned in certain regions, but quite frankly, we're committed to investing in our AutoZoners regardless of what happens with the regulatory environment. And quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're so good at driving productivity inside of the company. So again, we control our own destiny as it relates to these things and we're going to invest in a disciplined way to move the needle on earnings as a whole."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 13.1%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,960,000. This compares to $1,865,000 in Q1 last year. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. For the first quarter, our domestic do-it-for-me or DIFM sales increased 11.9% to $695 million, another strong quarter for us. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 22% of our total sales and increased approximately $75 million from last year's Q1. Our weekly sales per program were $11,500, up 9.2% on a per-program basis versus $10,600 per week last year. Not only was $11,500 per week the second highest average ever for us, but we were able to average $58 million in total weekly commercial sales, another near record and a tremendous accomplishment for our teams. As you know, commercial sales is an important growth initiative for us, and we are investing in a disciplined way to create a faster growing business. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores. This year, we have opened 36 net new programs, finishing with 5,043 total programs as our sales efficiency per store remains at near-record levels. Let me give a little more color on our success in commercial and the growth playbook as we move forward. This past year, we believe we grew share and remain focused on repeating this for FY2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts offering, many in the Duralast brand, improvements in our parts coverage by model year and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past two quarters and position us well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we are focused on several initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiatives by adding MegaHub locations. We opened three new MegaHubs this quarter, bringing our total to 47. These stores substantially increase local market availability, and we see a meaningful lift in sales in the markets where they opened. With over 80,000 SKUs or more, we deliver same day and often multiple times per day to stores in MegaHub markets. This means a store can say, yes, we have it significantly more than when they are sourced from a hub that carries 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs. Second, we are improving our service continually by upgrading service levels with our parts professionals and drivers. We are delivering faster, and we are supporting our customers with overall needs better than before. We recently implemented chainwide to the U.S. technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, using our one team approach, we have further integrated our commercial business at our stores where we offer programs. This means that store management and the entire team is focused on driving sales and improving service to our commercial customers. And fourth, we continue to invest in disciplined way in initiatives that make us more competitive in the marketplace and much easier to do business with. We like our growth prospects in commercial and believe our growth initiatives will help us create a faster growing AutoZone. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID's effect on customers' ability to get out and shop grew, we've ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter, we continued to see very strong growth in our buy online, pick-up in-store shopping channel. While our other two options, next day delivery and ship-to-home were also up nicely, our buy online, pick-up in-store offering continued its rapid growth. Pick-up in-store grew faster than our ship-to-home option as customers continue to value interaction with our experienced in-store advisors. While our online sales remain less than 5% of our DIY business, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pick-up. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 20.6 to the dollar and was roughly 6% higher than last year's first quarter rate. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. During the quarter, we did not open any new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we are seeing signs of a turnaround with the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedule in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 45 stores. We opened two new stores in the quarter. Like the U.S. and Mexico, Brazil faced challenges with COVID-19, stay-at-home mandates and foreign exchange headwinds. The Brazilian real devalued roughly 30% for Q1 year-over-year. We view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing the Brazilian business has not wavered. Now I'll pass it off to our CFO-elect and the new member of our team, Jamere Jackson, to take us through additional P&L items and our cash flow and balance sheet highlights. But before I do, I would like to personally welcome Jamere to our team. We are also excited to have him here. He has done a very quick study and we all look forward to his valuable contributions for many years to come. Jamere? I would just jump in and say that look from a gross perspective, it's down two quarters in a row, but frankly, a big chunk of this one was one-time. So you've got a little bit of pressure on some of the things that Jamere pointed out, for example, on loyalty. That's a great example of the fact that to follow on what Bill was talking about, is that we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore we're seeing a tremendous amount of new and existing customers. Our existing customers are visiting us more and they're building up more loyalty points. That's fantastic. As we talk about pricing and think about pricing and we're going to be incredibly surgical about it. As Jamere said, it's going to be very data-driven. And at the end of the day, this is about driving gross profit dollars. Ultimately that is what we are most focused on is driving dollars. And as you can see, we're improving operating margin overall because we're leveraging our fixed cost structure based on the sales that we are generating from all of our activities and pricing is just a small example of one of those activities. But I think overall, the way I think about it is, look, I think our gross margin is very healthy. I think it's completely in our control. We have opportunities to improve and reduce our cost through importing, increasing our importing, lowering our acquisition cost. And as Jamere pointed out, we have an opportunity to be surgical about how we price. And so I think there's a lot of pluses and minuses in gross margin. And right now, they're all working to drive sales and drive profits."

            "name": "William Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer-elect; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late September, much of the world's intention remains focused on COVID-19, including its current and future implications for communities, businesses and markets. These times remain extraordinary for all of us. From the start of the pandemic through this quarter, our team has had to deal with challenges unlike any we have seen in our company's history. While at the start of the pandemic our sales dipped, we performed quite well once economic stimulus was implemented in the U.S. and Americans began to drive more. By mid-April, our business began to strengthen and reached an apex last quarter when we reported 21.8% same-store sales, the best same-store sales performance in our company's rich history. For this quarter, ending in late November, we are proud to report 12.3% same-store sales, another historically strong performance. While last quarter's sales were more consistent, particularly across the first 12 weeks of the 16-week quarter, this quarter was a bit less so. Considering the meaningful volatility resulting from the pandemic and economic responses, we are sharing our same-store sales cadence for equal-week period of the quarter. We were up 16.5%, then up 11.4%, ending up 8.8% in the last four weeks. The deceleration appears to be related to a combination of normal seasonality and how far away we work from the benefits of economic stimulus. This quarter's traffic was far more beneficial to same-store sales than ticket growth by quite a wide margin. When we talked in September, we could not have effectively forecasted our growth for this quarter's same-store sales, albeit we would have been much closer than we would have forecast in Q4 at the beginning of that quarter. We are continuing to learn as we go. In Q1, we felt we would see substantial above-normal growth, but we wouldn't have thought double-digit same-store sales. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to follow the myriad of national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs of the CDC guidelines. We require mask entering our facilities, perform questionnaires of our team and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing mask, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. Last quarter, we talked about the pressure our supply chain was experiencing to make sure we were in-stock and replenishing the stores on a timely basis. I'm very happy to say, today, we feel we've made significant progress in this area. Our in-stocks are much improved and our supply chain in most of our vendor partners have done an exceptional job reacting to the unprecedented surge in volumes that have now lasted six-plus months. The progress has been significant, but at the end of the quarter, we had only closed about half of the gap from our depths to our normal levels of in-stock. To provide a little more color on the drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I'll remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits. While the initial stimulus package ended at the end of July, there were still funds being distributed on a state-by-state basis at lower levels this fall. As you recall, last quarter we reported finishing the quarter with comp sales running up 16.5%. And you can see we remain strong for this quarter. While our enhanced sales growth declined over the quarter to still historically high levels, we believe the noise around the election, the reemergence of COVID in many areas and the beginnings of seasonal weather patterns hurt food traffic particularly in the last four-week period. While it remains extremely hard to predict sales performance in the near-term, we believe the fundamentals of our business remain quite strong. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, but all of our regions performed well. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales for customer segment data we have, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains, historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the high-single digits and our sales have been growing at close to double that rate for these categories. While we are thrilled to have these share gains today, our charge is to determine how we maintain them. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There are simply too many remaining unknowns, like will the Federal Government pass the second round of stimulus? And when will the vaccine be distributed? And how effective will it be? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which ones have changed permanently? All of this creates uncertainty. But our focus on execution remains the same. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. For the long-term, we've remained bullish on the health of our industry. And as the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks the strongest periods we experienced of outsized sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001-2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of these outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that followed. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we've retained many of those customers in the years that followed. I would be remiss if I did not thank our AutoZoners for their exceptional efforts. While I'll praise our entire organization from our stores to our distribution centers, from the U.S. to Mexico to Brazil at all data and our store support teams, I always owe our thanks to our customers who continue to believe in our capabilities to help them with their automotive needs. I couldn't be prouder of our team. As usual, I want to especially recognize on behalf of every AutoZoner our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been challenged more than they ever could have expected, and they have met every single challenge. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner, and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every day. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 12.3% versus last year's first quarter. Our net income was $442 million, and our EPS was $18.61 a share, 30.1% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 13% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 12%. In commercial, we averaged over $58 million in weekly sales, which was over $11,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as we change seasons. Moving forward, we expect our commercial business to show continued strength as we execute on our growth initiatives and gain additional share in this space. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there are some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong as we believe people have more time and many have more money. Many parts of the economy are still operating at fractions of their normal capacity: movie theaters, vacation resorts, entertainment venues, hotels and the like. Some Americans have the luxury to, \u201cwork-from-home\u201d, eliminating their commute, and unfortunately, while vastly improved from the early days of the pandemic, unemployment is still twice the pre-pandemic rate. This extra time and for some, extra funds, have been repurposed for that project car or doing that enhancement job our customers have been perpetually putting off. At the same time, while our sales have increased in merchandise categories like brakes, rotors and even motor oil, they aren't growing as fast as the rest of the categories due to last year's mild winter and lower current miles driven. We believe miles driven will continue to improve and maintenance parts will increase as miles driven go up. And we know from history that the muted brake and rotor growth is also still being impacted by last year's very mild winter. As for this year's winter, all indications we have call for a normal winter. Anything, anything normal in this environment will be welcomed. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. One thing we are certain of is our team continues to perform at an exceptional level. I'm so proud of them across the enterprise. We remain focused on providing everyone with the support, encouragement and resources they need to live up to our pledge of always putting customers first. Now I'd like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. In particular, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions of our store and distribution center AutoZoners and their leaders who have been there for our customers, external or internal, every day since the beginning of the pandemic. I ask each of you listening to this call to stop for a moment and imagine yourself in a public environment five-plus days a week for the last nine months, helping customers while at the same time trying to keep yourself, your teammates, your customers and ultimately your own family safe from the virus. Seriously, seriously stop and think about that. That is exactly what our team has done. Our stores haven't closed. Our distribution centers are operating at breakneck speed. Thanks to these AutoZoners at our stores and distribution centers for all they've done. In the spring, we implemented something innovative and new for all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners and ultimately for our store managers and DC advisors. We offered them emergency-time off or ETO as we call it. In essence, it amounted to two extra weeks of vacation to give them the flexibility to ensure their safety, deal with childcare issues, care for a sick family member or most importantly, stay home, stay home if they were showing any symptoms. It is worth and it's worked exceptionally well. Many of them have used this benefit while a significant portion have saved it and will receive meaningful payouts should they choose next month, an $800 to $1,600 or more bonus for most of our hourly AutoZoners. When we rolled this new benefit out, as you would expect, we shared that it was a one-time extraordinary benefit. Who knew then that the pandemic would still be racing at the turn of the calendar year? So two weeks ago, we announced our team that we would allow them to carry over any unused ETO or be paid out in January at their election, that every single AutoZoner who has unused normal vacation would be allowed to carry it over six months past the normal deadline. And most importantly, that we would be extending all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners, store managers and DC advisors in the U.S. with another week of ETO at the beginning of the new calendar year. This is an expense that will be recognized in our second quarter of approximately $50 million. And as I've told our AutoZoners on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving when I made the announcement, it's a large expense, but is more importantly a tremendous investment in them and their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? Thank you, Jamere and welcome. These continue to be unique and abnormal times, and they require us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. Our operating theme this year is AutoZone is strong, and I'm honored to say we have come together this year to live this theme like never before. While it's impossible for us to know what the cadence of the new year sales will be, I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. While our domestic retail business continues to do very well, we understand trends will slow in the future. But we believe we have a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. While we understand these things, we also feel we are well positioned for continued future share gain opportunities across all the business segments we operate. Our business continues to do very well, but as always we have work to do as we start calendar 2021. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows will look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on AutoZone. Before we proceed to Q&A, I want to take the liberty to publicly thank two exceptional leaders. Over 37 years ago, Bill Hackney followed in his father's footsteps and joined this extraordinary enterprise. And over those 37-plus years, Bill leveraged his knowledge of virtually every part of this business and his deep understanding of our customers to our and our customers' benefit. He will be missed. And almost 15 years ago, Bill Giles traded home goods for auto parts, and boy, weren't we fortunate. I've had the honor to partner with Bill ever since he joined the company. How many CEOs have the privilege to host 59 consecutive earnings release calls with the same world-class CFO. Bill has been a great team member and advisor for our entire organization, and we thank you, Bill. While we will miss both of them, as our Founder's father J.R. Hyde Jr., often said, \u201cNo individual builds a business, they build an organization, and the organization builds the business\u201d. Both of these AutoZoners for life have embraced that mentality and built tremendous teams. We wish you and your families the best of luck in your next chapter and thank you for all you've done for each of us. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Thank you for the question Bret. On the commercial side of the business, you've seen the publicly available numbers and I think first of all, we're at the top of the heap in both the retail and commercial businesses with our public peers. So I think we're doing very well there. Regarding your specific question on WDs, clearly during the worst of times back in Q3, we were in a very different position than some of our smaller competitors. They really shut things down, many of them closed or work reduced hours had less inventory and the like. And I think that that gave us a real opportunity to introduce ourselves and be there for certain customers, that maybe we didn't have the same relationship before. As we've said many, many times the commercial part of this business certainly is a relationship business. And when you're there for customers, you build up some credibility that you can leverage for a long time. So I think that's the bigger issue rather than them getting back to where their normal operating procedures are, that we were there in people's times of need. And I think that people have long memories about that. On the retail side of the business, again, I think we're performing at the highest level of any of our public peers. But I also think that there are other parts of the channel, other channels in the retail sector, mass and online that we did particularly well against during this period of time and continue to do so. Again, I think, is it sustainable or not? That's the biggest charge that we have as a management team. We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to new customers. And as we said in our prepared remarks, much of our business growth in the retail business is coming from existing customers who are doing more business with us. And I think it's very encouraging that we're \u2013 they're participating with us in different categories than they normally do. And so we feel very good about that. Yes. I wish I had better information to answer that question, Bret. We have very specific information on the sales floor categories in our retail business. We don't have that level of information on the commercial business. So we have to \u2013 like everybody else look pretty much at the topline numbers and try to extrapolate from there, but we feel like we're doing well. I can't tell you how the WDs are doing as a whole. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Chris, thank you for the question. A lot of attention gets focused on our close end competitors and rightfully so, and they both outperform us on a sales per program basis and have for a long time. I'm really pleased with what our team has been able to do to begin closing that gap. But we really don't want to get too focused on our close end competitors. We want to think about the industry as a whole. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's a $75 billion market. It is incredibly fragmented, much more so fragmented than the retail side of the business. So I want to make sure that we're focused on the entire market, not our close end competitors. If you look back over the history of time, what our team has been able to do has really helped us as you've noted, accelerate our growth in a significant way. We've vastly improved our inventory assortments in every individual store, particularly as it relates to commercial oriented vehicles. We have this hub and MegaHub strategy, which we are rolling out and continue to outperform, particularly the MegaHubs. Every time we talk about the MegaHubs, we talk about that they have outperformed our expectations. We now have built this fabulous brand called the Duralast brand, which five to seven years ago, people thought it was an inhibitor to our success. Now, everybody else sees it as a real key part and a leverage point for us in the commercial business. Think about the other national brands at a decade ago were so powerful. Many of them are gone. Those that are still around are less relevant today than they were back then. And now we've also built this really strong salesforce, which we didn't have a decade ago. We're now supplementing all of that with some technology tools that are some of the largest investments that we've made in technology to make our teams more efficient and improve our delivery and reliability. So we're very bullish on what the future is and frankly, pretty proud of the progress that we've made today. Perfect. Chris, thanks for getting that normal question in another way. I'll answer it the normal way because we released our earnings so quick in the quarter, so we're two weeks and three days into this quarter. We don't want to talk about what's happening this quarter because we don't want our owners to get focused on two and a half week periods of time. So historically, we have not talked about what's happened inter quarter and we're not going to do that today. We were very specific in showing you what happened in each four-week period during the quarter. We don't generally give that level of clarity either. I want to remind us coming into Q4 that we told you we were up 16.5% in the last four weeks of last quarter. I told you today that we were up 16.5%, the first four-week period. I think a lot of people thought our sales had gone down materially in September, and that wasn't true. Regarding that 8.8 that we had in the last four-week period of time. We were very intentional in saying, yes, the election was going on. We also \u2013 in this period of time, sales are driven up and down based upon weather patterns. We get a cold snap, it can be very positive. We get very rainy weather, it can be very negative. So we've given you the cadence. It's very hard for us to talk about and even understand what the next 12 weeks is going to be like, we don't know. These are unprecedented levels. 12.3% same-store sales is the best performance in this company since I've joined the company over 26 years ago. It will slow down over time. How fast that happened? I don't know. But I do know we have an incredibly strong business that regardless will continue to outperform over the long-term. Yes. You too. Well. Really terrific question, Michael. Yes, this time is different. There's no question about it. I've said it \u2013 I've just said it. This is the second best quarter since I've been at the company. The best quarter was last quarter. Will we be able to comp 21.8% same-store sales in Q4? I highly doubt it. Will we give some of that back? Absolutely. The question is, will we give it all back? Are we introducing ourselves to new customers? Or introducing existing customers to new categories for us? Are we kind of standing in that gap for customers? I think we are. And I think we're going to build loyalty with our customers over the long-term. My real question for us is if we had this pandemic, what would our sales have been two years from now? I'm sorry, there's a train outside of the room. If we had this pandemic and you moved forward two years from now and we have 2%, 3%, 4% increase in business that we would have had the pandemic not happen. I think that's a distinct possibility. And if we do, I think we'd be very pleased with that. You are always good at those kinds of things, Michael. It is light and it's not a train usually. Thank you, Michael. Thank you. Yes. Another fantastic question. Thank you. As you look at the commercial business, you're exactly right, that miles driven are down and they've been down for a period of time. I would also tell you that another thing that's muting the commercial business is the lack of winter that we had last year. Tire sales were down. Maintenance sales were down, brakes, rotors, which I've talked about specifically in the prepared remarks. The other thing that's happening in that sector is the independent part of the sector is performing much better today than the national accounts, if you will. And I think those things will change over time. As you see, we get back into a normal weather pattern, but again, we're having this opportunity to introduce ourselves, particularly to some of these up and down the street accounts at a different level than we have on the past. I don't believe that people are \u201creturning to work\u201d. We don't see it yet in a significant miles driven improvement. It improved vastly in the summertime, but then it's kind of been fairly steady over the recent months we've seen. But I'll remind you that not all miles driven are the same. So people that are driving to work in some of these urban cores, generally aren't our core customer. Our core customer has not had the luxury just like our AutoZoners that are in the stores and the distribution centers. Our core customer doesn't have the luxury to work from home. They're doing manual labor. They're providing service economy kind of jobs. And so I don't think that our core customers really seen a significant change in their driving behaviors. I think it's a very fair way to think about it. And I'll just remind you, when we got serious about the commercial business was 2008. We were doing about $750 million annually at that point in time. In the last 12 years, we've more than tripled the business, getting close to quadruple in the business. And it's been pretty darn sticky along the way. That's certainly our hope. And as we're launching many of these new initiatives that are only going to amplify our service advantage, as we've now shored up our inventory assortments, we've built this brand and we've got somebody telling our story and our salesforce, we feel pretty good about the future. Will it be a straight line? No, it never is. But we've had a pretty strong trajectory over the last 12 years of growing that business much faster than the industry has grown. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call, a very happy and most important, a healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to recognize our AutoZoners for their tremendous success this past year. They far exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the year and in a very challenging environment as our pledge states put our customers first, resulting in additional share gains and terrific sales performance on top of fantastic results in FY '21. We grew our overall sales of 11.1% on top of 15.8% growth last year, resulting in a two-year growth that is among the highest we've ever experienced. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. This year began with the resurgence of the pandemic, ongoing supply chain challenges, a very difficult staffing environment and finished with rising interest rates and inflation at its highest levels in decades, all as major storylines. Throughout the year, our team's incredible supply chain efforts to improve our in-stock position, likely at industry-leading levels, helped our sales growth. These efforts resulted in a positive retail comp and an exceptionally strong commercial comp for both the quarter and the year. Any way you evaluate our FY '22 performance, we had a terrific year. Congratulations AutoZoners, and thanks for always putting our customers first, which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q4 overall same-store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for FY '23. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 6.2% this quarter on top of last year's 4.3%. On a two-year basis, we delivered 10.5% comp and on a three-year basis, a remarkable 32.3% stacked comp. Our team once again executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons and significant challenges I mentioned above. Our growth rates for commercial and retail were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 20%. This quarter was our sixth consecutive commercial growth above 20%. Additionally, Commercial set a fourth quarter record with $1.442 billion in sales, an impressive accomplishment. We generated $260 million more in sales this quarter than in Q4 last year. For the fiscal year, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion versus $3.3 billion just a year ago, up over 26%. Last fall, at our National Sales Meeting, our Senior VP of Commercial, Grant McGee, declared a stretched goal to achieve $4 billion in sales for FY '22. That lofty goal ultimately was a near lofty enough. We also set a record average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $17,000 per store versus $14,400 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 26% in last year's quarter. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store inventory, massive improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being quote priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team's performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.1% comp this quarter. While our two-year comp decelerated from Q3's, we believe the more relevant comp is the three-year and we are higher than last year's quarter at 24.5% versus 21.6%. For the year, we were very proud of our DIY results considering we grew so much in FY '21. To level set, we had 11% DIY comp in FY '21. And for the full year '22, we were up 2.9%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison, which was driven by the various forms of stimulus last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous share gains in dollars and more importantly, in units that we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY '23. Now let's focus on sales cadence. Our quarter spans 16 weeks, early May through the end of August. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first four weeks to high single digits, 8.4%. The next eight weeks, our growth was nearly halved, dropping to 4.9%. And then. it reaccelerated over the last four weeks, up 6.8%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are difficult to interpret as so much was going on last year and even the year before. However, for Q4, our two-year comp was 10.5% and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 10.4%, 9.4%, 7.9% and 14.4%, respectively. But our three-year comp was 32.3% and for the four-week periods of the quarter increased 35.2%, 33.5%, 30.1% and 31%, respectively. We have been encouraged by the sustainability of the enormous sales gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Regarding weather in May and June, we experienced slightly cooler and wetter weather trends across the country. By July, however, it became very hot across most of the country, and it remained unseasonably warm for August. Overall, we feel weather had a small but slightly positive effect on our sales performance. As we look forward to the fall months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, cold or hot, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down roughly 7%, while our ticket was up about 8%. Our transaction count decline wasn't surprising and was driven by lower demand for discretionary sales floor items. However, we were pleased to be in line with last quarter's three-year transaction trends. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We're also very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Our sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers, along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. I regularly visit our stores and commercial customers and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our offerings. The reception our AutoZoners are receiving from our customers and as importantly, our prospective customers has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. I'll say it now, but we're determined, determined to continue to grow meaningfully faster than the market, and we're focused on future growth opportunities to keep our momentum. Our goal stated simply, overtime is to become the industry leader in both sectors. As we start our new fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the fall months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 30 basis point difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country with the Northeast and Midwest being higher. As the Northeast and Midwest were warmer in May and June, their sales accelerated. However, this trend reversed itself over the last eight weeks of the quarter. As the remainder of the country heated up, those regions grew their comp sales faster than the Northeast and Midwest markets. Heading into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we continue to believe weather will have only a minimal impact on our sales. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. While I said our same-store sales were up 6.2% versus last year's fourth quarter, our net income was $810 million and our EPS was $40.51 a share, increasing 13.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hot parts outperformed sales floor categories with approximately a 2.5% difference between them. As gas prices increased, our discretionary sales for merchandise categories certainly softened. The discretionary categories represent approximately 20% of our DIY sales in any one quarter. But this quarter, they were weaker at 19% of the retail mix. This category was down 6.5% in the quarter versus up 3.5% last year in Q4. More recently, as gas prices have abated, we are encouraged to see the discretionary categories bounce back a bit. In general, the categories that are driven by failure due to heat performed well, and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lapped very strong performance last year and exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this fall as we expect miles driven to improve while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 11% from inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was up about 10%. We believe both numbers for the first quarter will be similar. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We believe inflation is stabilizing. We are seeing transportation costs begin to moderate after reaching historic levels, but we are not seeing product cost deflation yet nor are we seeing any signs that labor wage growth is slowing. Importantly, I want to point out that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to midterm sales. What I previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a two- and three-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we've achieved in both sectors. Over the past 12 to 18 months, the overall macro environment has been favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for some of our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our first quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we are focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn, drive our sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new distribution centers domestically and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but they increase our capacity. We didn't expect to grow our business 30% in three years as we did, and that will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. I'm also excited to announce that we opened a new facility on the West Coast just this month to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs postponing the inventory allocation and therefore, reducing safety stock. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more product closer and closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses and almost 800 stores open internationally, these businesses had impressive performance this past fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable fourth quarter last year with 6.2% domestic comp growth, a 5.7% increase in EBIT and a 13.4% increase in EPS. Our results for the entire fiscal year were incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $5.3 billion, up 8.9%. For the year, our total sales were $16.3 billion, up 11.1% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY '19. Our sales are up an amazing 37% or nearly $4.4 billion since 2019. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 22% to $1.4 billion and were up 43.2% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $17,000, up 18.1% as we exceeded our internal expectations. Our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 87% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 66 net new programs finishing with 5,342 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY '22 and our results in the fourth quarter and year reflected this dynamic. For FY '22, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion, up 26.5% versus last year. Importantly, we believe we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we're delivering on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing an exceptional service has enabled us to deliver double-digit sales growth for the past eight quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And as I've noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 78 mega-hub locations with 11 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $17,000 per program, the 78 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial front. In fact, our commercial mega-hub business grew at twice the rate of our overall commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lift the entire network. This strategy is working. We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by our objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. We're targeting up to 25 new mega-hubs in FY '23. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited, and we're determined to build on our strong momentum. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business comp was up 1.1% in Q4. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 7% from last year's traffic levels. However, we also saw 8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. For FY '22, our DIY comp grew 2.9% and 14.1% on a two-year stack basis. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continue to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injections and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady throughout the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY '23. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 30 new stores in Mexico to finish with 703 stores and 14 new stores in Brazil, ending with 72. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 73 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and a 28 basis points headwind stemming from a non-cash $15 million LIFO charge. I'd like to address the $50 million LIFO charge we took this past quarter, which came from the exhaustion of our reserve balance that occurred during the quarter. The level set, we went from a $335 million reserve balance in Q4 of last year to zero in Q4 this year, plus an additional $15 million charge. Said differently, we recognized $350 million in higher costs this past year. Basically, all the reduction in our reserves came from higher inventoriable freight costs. This charge does not show up in our cash flow statement this quarter because the accounting for LIFO will adjust the weighted average cost through the P&L to the last in higher-priced items. In a nutshell, it assumes everything you sold in the quarter was at the last and higher prices. We're still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, which in turn means we are modeling LIFO charges through the first half of the new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we anticipate up to $100 million in LIFO charges, and we're forecasting a similar amount for the second quarter. I will note that if freight costs abate as we expect them to, then we'll see these charges reverse and we'll begin to rebuild a LIFO reserve balance. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 12 basis points driven by strong sales growth. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 5.7% versus the prior year's quarter driven by our strong sales growth. FY '22, EBIT was just under $3.3 billion, up 11.1% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, up 10.1% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.1 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q4 end last year. We're planning interest in the $55 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $43.3 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.1% and flat with last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 70 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 215 basis points. For the first quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $810 million, up 3.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $20 million was 9.1% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $40.51, up 13.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For FY '22, net income was $2.4 billion, up 11.9% and earnings per share was $117.19, up 23.1%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, spent $300 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $900 million of free cash flow. For the year, we generated $2.5 million in free cash versus $2.9 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow versus last year was due to a change in working capital this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 18.4% versus Q4 last year and total inventory increased 21.5% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our growth initiatives and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $240,000 versus negative $203,000 last year and negative $216,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.5% versus last year's Q4 of 129.6%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $1.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 10% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage metric finished Q4 at 2.1x EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target during FY '23. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and a fast-growing commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the new year. Last night, we kicked off our National Sales meeting with our amazing President's Club winners, our very best store managers. This week, we will embrace our theme for the year, Accelerate Together. We are very excited to have our field leadership team in Memphis for the next four days and I cannot wait to congratulate everyone on their year and thank them for their phenomenal results. They delivered exceptional results in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service heading into fiscal '23. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service and this is what will continue to define our success well into the future. As we've accelerated our top line, our competitive positioning has materially improved and customer behavior may have permanently changed post-pandemic. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, and it is a very long track record of strong performance with high returns and consistent cash flows. We would also encourage you to migrate to studying our performance on a one-year comp to gauge our performance as we believe the business is steady enough to talk about year-over-year comps going forward. This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. This year, in particular, is a rewarding experience. Our team delivered some really impressive milestones, $16.3 billion in sales racing past the $15 billion milestone. DIY comps of 2.9%, most impressively, 21.6% on a three-year basis. Commercial sales blew past $4 billion, ending at $4.23 billion. Average weekly sales domestically of $46,300 per store per week equating to over $2.4 million per store annually. Our Mexico and ALLDATA teams both broke numerous records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count. We bought back a record-breaking $4.4 billion in AutoZone stock, and our team has grown our EBIT by roughly 50% in three years. Yes, that's five-zero, and that is remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels, and we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure. Our greatest challenge, which we will spend time discussing this week with the team, is \"exiting pandemic mode.\" In addition to our fanatical customer focus and our phenomenal culture, a huge part of our historical success has been flawless execution. In all Candor, we haven't been flawlessly executing. In the depths of the pandemic, it was impossible and our teams appropriately made trade-offs. We have ensured that some of those trade-offs do not result in \"new norms or worse, numbness or bad habits.\" Those new norms can't and won't be tolerated. We have to make sure our in-stock levels finally recover to our historic levels and they recover soon. Our vendors must return to providing us with the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function correctly always. We have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine we have always been an exit pandemic mode. I've had the honor of being part of this team for nearly 28 years now, and it has been one of the great privileges of my life. I could not be more proud of our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to passionately serving our customers. We must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success and rest assured, we are doing just that. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our team at AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Bill. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret, please ask your question.\nBret Jordan: On the supply chain comment, could you maybe give us an update where we are as far as fill rates go and the cadence of improvement? It does seem to some commercial customers finding parts is still a bit of a challenge.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Bret. It's still quite challenging. And it's moved. I've talked about it over time. It moves from one category to another one. Most of our hard part categories, we're in pretty good shape on. We have some challenges in areas like filtration. But generally, we're in pretty good shape, but we are still a couple of points behind our overall in-stock rate that we had before the pandemic. It's been very stubborn, frankly. We're looking to push through it. But every time we think we've got it solved in other category rears its ugly head.\nBret Jordan: And then in the prepared remarks, you mentioned price right and obviously, a big topic this year. Are you seeing anything in the market pricing, whether it be in the DIY against the non-traditionals? Is anything changing in pricing cadence?\nJamere Jackson: No, we're not seeing anything changed in terms of pricing cadence. We've been very disciplined about the pricing that we put in the marketplace. Again, we've been pricing to recover inflation and been doing that pretty consistently. And as I've said before, our industry has been very disciplined over time as it relates to this, and we're not seeing anything that throws us out of whack there.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Steven Zaccone of Citi. Steven, please ask your question.\nSteven Zaccone: So our question was on the DIY side of the business. You cited resilient expectations for this year and thinking about the business on a one-year basis. Do you see the potential to comp positive again in fiscal '23? And within that context, you cited some weakness on the discretionary side. How do you expect that to perform over the balance of the year now that gas prices have come down a bit?\nBill Rhodes: Sure. Well, first, on the latter part of the question, we addressed it a little bit in our prepared remarks that when gas prices were $5.50 a gallon on average across the country, we saw an immediate reduction in our discretionary products. As those gas prices have come back down, we've seen discretionary products improve. You have to be careful because it's such a small part of our business, but we've certainly seen it improve. As for whether or not we can see positive comps in DIY for FY '23, as you know, we don't give guidance. There's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace with inflation, with rising interest rates and the like. But I will tell you -- I'll answer it this way. This latter part of the fourth quarter was much stronger than we were expecting it to be in June and July. And so that gives us some confidence that at least for now, the DIY business is really quite strong. And frankly, as strong if not stronger than we thought it would be back in the early months of the summer.\nSteven Zaccone: The follow-up I had was just thinking about the commercial business from a higher level. You said you've grown past the $4 billion sales target that you had. How should we think about the multiyear path for that business? And I guess, what are the strategies you're focused on for the next chapter of growth?\nBill Rhodes: I think the strategies that we're focused on for the next chapter of growth are the same ones that we've been working on for about five years. We're going to continue to make sure that we've got the best coverage in the marketplace. That considers being in the best situation in the local store. It also means expansion of hubs and mega-hubs. We've talked about growing our mega-hubs from today's 78 to 200. So, we're just over -- just under 40% of the way there, and we're moving pretty quickly. Same kind of trajectory on the hub stores, we're around 200. We want to get to 300 of those. So we have lots of growth still in front of us on hubs and mega-hubs, and we're continuing to test new philosophies and new coverage even in those. We're going to continue to focus on the Duralast brand. We're leveraging technology to make our people more efficient and to reduce our delivery times. We're always making sure that we're priced strike. We've got a lot of different strategies, and that's the thing to me that's most encouraging is it's not one single thing that's making this happen. It's a holistic substantial improvement in our competitive positioning in the marketplace. At the end of the day, we got around 4% share in commercial. I said on the call today, the first time we've ever said it. We want to win and be the largest in both sectors. And it's going to take us a while, but that's our goal. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've had with 20% growth over six consecutive quarters, that's pretty phenomenal regardless of how the industry is growing.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please ask your question.\nSimeon Gutman: I'll be the LIFO person for the call. So the LIFO charges because of freight, non-cash. If you look out 12 to 18 months, do you get back all the charges to earnings either freight subsides or you take credits? Or you actually just raise price when over time to recoup this?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, Simeon. So what we're modeling right now, as we said, is up to $100 million in the first quarter due primarily to higher freight. We are starting to see freight moderate some in the spot markets. However, what I'll remind you is that when we were in this environment of trying to make sure that we had capacity, we were incurring higher freight charges just so that we could secure capacity. So as those short-term contracted capacity dynamics happen from freight start to roll off, we'll start to see the benefits of what we're starting to see in the marketplace, which is a moderating freight market. You could see this in the back half get better, barring any disruptions. But right now, from a forecast standpoint, we're modeling somewhere in the neighborhood of close to $100 million in the first quarter and something similar in the second quarter. From a pricing standpoint, what we've said is that when there's hyperinflation on things like freight, where, for example, container costs went up 7x what we normally pay and then spike back down over time, you typically don't price to recover those kinds of spikes. What you do is you wait for the market to sort of moderate and your price accordingly to what you see the long-term impacts are going to be. So, we're continuing to price in a disciplined way. We're monitoring what's happening in the freight markets. It will come back. It's already starting to come back. And what you'll see is that we'll get credits coming back through the P&L to offset the charges that I've talked about for the first and the second quarter. And then as we get back to our normal market conditions, you'll see us rebuild that reserve balance over time.\nSimeon Gutman: I'll ask something different for the follow-up. If you look at the units in DIY, they're probably negative. So, can you talk about the stacks there whether it's stabilizing and thinking about reversion or even elasticity, does the DIY units, do they stay negative or they work back to flat through fiscal '23?\nBill Rhodes: Simeon, you followed us for a lot of years, and you've heard me say many times that the dirty little secret of our industry is that there's downward pressure on units and have been for decades. So oftentimes, we'll be down 3% or 4% in units and customer count. A lot of that is driven by improvements in automobile technology. So easy example is spark bugs. He used to buy spark bugs and they were copper spark bugs and they would last for 30,000 miles. Now you buy Iridium spark bugs and they last 100,000 miles. Now the old copper spark bugs used to cost $0.59. Now Iridium's are oftentimes over $10. So, there's an upward pressure on cost or peaks -- price per piece and a downward pressure on units. I think our downward pressure in the fourth quarter was more exaggerated than it typically is, mainly because of the incredible performance that we've seen over the last three years. I think there's been some moderation. There was also a little bit of moderation as we said, because of the discretionary items, accessories and the like. Is that helpful?\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. That's helpful.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please ask your question.\nMichael Lasser: Understanding that you don't provide guidance, but in light of the $100 million LIFO charge this quarter and next quarter, coupled with rising interest expense and what looks to be a slightly higher tax rate year-over-year, is it best that we assume this is going to be a sub algorithm year even if you comp in the traditional 3% to 4% range and buy back a similar amount of stock that you have been buying back?\nJamere Jackson: From an operating standpoint, we will be spot on the algorithm that we've typically had. You do have some dynamics associated with LIFO this year where if you model in a couple of quarters of LIFO charges in the $100 million range, it will have a non-operating impact on our gross margins. So if you're thinking about modeling it that way, then certainly, that's potentially the case. But we'll come back to you. We'll be very transparent about what we're seeing. As we said, we're starting to see some moderation in the dynamics that are causing us to take a LIFO charge. As we get through the first and the second quarter, we could see some moderation there and that could change how you ultimately end up for the fiscal year. But what I want to make sure that people understand is that this certainly is an operational deficiency. It's simply non-cash LIFO accounting. And we're continuing to run the business in a very disciplined way, which means that as we've seen pricing impacts on our product costs, we're continuing to take pricing. We'll continue to drive our growth initiatives. We're going to be a very strong cash flow generator. And the most important part of the operating model in our mind is that cash is going to mean that we're going to invest in our business, and we're going to return a meaningful amount of that to shareholders this year.\nBill Rhodes: Jamere, let me jump in and amplify a couple of points, too. First of all, I've been involved with this company since before we went public in 1991. This is the first time we've ever had a LIFO charge period. These are uncertain times or unique dynamics, especially with the level of inflation that we've seen in cargo freight going from $1,800 to over $20,000 per container. Those numbers have moderated significantly now, but we do have some long term -- or some midterm contracts, call them 6 to 12 months where we had to secure capacity. It is our full expectation -- and I don't know if it will happen this year or not. It's going to depend on freight costs. It is our full anticipation whatever charges we take in Q1 and Q2 ultimately will be reversed, and we will go back to zero and then we'll start building a LIFO reserve that we don't record. So, we think this $100 million to $200 million charge will be temporary, and it will reverse and it could be -- the back half of this year, could be next year, but that is fully our expectation.\nMichael Lasser: So just to clarify, your point being, yes, for maybe this year on a GAAP basis, your EPS algorithm might be a little bit lower than it's been historically, but that's just a GAAP reporting number, the cash flow characteristics of the business aren't changing. And so, if that's the correct interpretation, is it fair to assume that eventually the gross margin can get back to 52% or better over time as this accounting situation reverses and perhaps you start to see the benefits of deflation in your product cost while you keep your retails flat or growing?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I don't want to specifically say 52% gross margins is what the future is going to look like. As you've seen, there are pressures on gross margin as we continue to grow this commercial business at such an accelerated rate. That pressure is likely going to continue. But just like you said, the GAAP charge, let's just say, it was $200 million for the first half of the year. A year from now or 18 months from now, you're also going to have to think about when that $200 million comes back through the P&L. And so, we would encourage you to look at it, excluding the LIFO charges, both as it's a penalty for us now and when it's a benefit for us whenever that happens.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Scott Catarelli from Truist Securities. Scott, please ask your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, I guess I have another question on kind of the same SKU inflation outlook. I mean while you guys are still seeing double-digit same SKU inflation, year-over-year comparisons do start to become much more difficult over the next few quarters. So, how should we think about the comp cadence as those comparisons start to become difficult?\nJamere Jackson: Well, from a comp cadence standpoint, a couple of things I'll point you to is, remember, the first two quarters of last year, we have well over 13% domestic comps. And those are toughest two quarters from a comp standpoint and then you start to see that comp sort of moderate in the back half of the year. And we encourage you for the full year to look at our comps on a year-over-year basis. And the things that we've talked about is, again, we have a resilient DIY business, albeit in a marketplace that has some volatility and some uncertainty associated with it. We've been very disciplined and our growth initiatives are delivered. And then probably the most important part of our story is the commercial story where we're continuing to see accelerated growth in commercial, driven by all the initiatives that Bill talked about and the fact that we're a four or five share in a large and growing market. So, that's how you should think about our comps. And again, the first half comps obviously are going to be a little bit tougher just given the fact that we printed over 13% in the first two quarters of last year.\nScot Ciccarelli: And then just a quick follow-up here. Does the increase in interest rates and higher interest costs change your expectations at all for your debt-to-EBITDAR targets? Or maybe how aggressive you plan to be on your buyback program?\nJamere Jackson: They don't. A couple of things I'll point you to. One is we've been at roughly a 2.1x metric. So, we have a lot of dry powder to get back to our 2.5x metric. We continue to stress that as we move through this period where our business has grown on an accelerated basis, and we have confidence in our growth prospects going forward. And we're going to move back closer to or at that 2.5x target. So that gives us a lot of financial firepower to, first of all, invest in our existing assets and grow our business, but also to give meaningful amounts back to our shareholders. So you'll see us continue to drive free cash flow and get our leverage metrics back to the 2.5x. And that means that we'll be able to do some exciting things for shareholders in the future.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Kate, please ask your question.\nKate McShane: We wondered within DIFM, if you're seeing similar demand trends from national accounts and independents? And also in DIFM, how is private label playing a role in this expanded business? Is it becoming a higher percentage of your mix?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Terrific questions, Kate. I'll take the last one first. Duralast continues to perform exceptionally well in the DIFM sector. We've rolled it into more categories. In the last few years, we've rolled it into shocks and struts. We've rolled out a Duralast Gold type performance chassis program, and we've rolled out Duralast elite brake pads. Each of these have been well received in both the retail and the commercial market, where 10 years ago, everybody would say, we couldn't be successful in commercial because of the Duralast brand. I think, the exact opposite is true. It has become a real strength for us. Remind me the first part of your question, sorry.\nKate McShane: Just demand trends from national accounts and independents.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, sorry. I think they're very, very similar. Both are doing very well. There's not a discernible difference between the two right now.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Daniel, please ask your question.\nDaniel Imbro: Bill, you discussed your new supply chain investment, I think it's on the West Coast for direct importing. Obviously, direct importing is tough especially with fill rates are so important. There's been some changes on your merchandising management internally. So can you just walk through the pros and cons, I mean, growing the direct import business, maybe how you manage that risk in the supply chain backdrop?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. First of all, we've been -- thanks for the question. Terrific. We've been direct importing for years. We've got a strong team of people in China today and import from China and Taiwan and Vietnam and Turkey and India. We've got a very robust direct import program that will continue to grow, and it's been a very important part of us managing our product cost over long periods of time. What we're doing today is we're going to make it more efficient for us. So, we've opened in the beginning stages of opening a direct import facility in California. We also announced that we're going to be opening a new distribution center in New Kent, Virginia and attached to that new distribution center will also be a direct import facility. What this is going to allow us to do is continue to import, but instead of having to buy in quantities that are going to ship from China or Turkey or India by distribution center, we're going to flow them into this direct import facility and it allows us to do postponement on the allocation of the inventory by probably 45 days, which will make us be able to reduce our safety stock in a significant way and make us more efficient. I'm really excited about this new program.\nDaniel Imbro: And Jamere, I want to follow up on the SG&A side. I think Do-It-For-Me or commercial delivery costs are actually in that line. So can you talk about maybe on a store level basis, what the SG&A initiatives are that you're implementing, just impressed you're able to leverage that despite the growth in commercial? So trying to understand what's happening on the non-commercial delivery, kind of the core SG&A side of the business?\nJamere Jackson: We've continued to run the playbook that we've always run inside the Company on SG&A, where we're very disciplined about cost. We tend to try to run our SG&A line to be somewhat close to what we're seeing from a sales standpoint. And so, there's a laundry list of tactics that we run every single year to make sure that we're delivering productivity from an SG&A standpoint. Every function is involved in that. So it isn't just the store functions that are a part of that. And those are the things that are, quite frankly, give us a lot of confidence that we're able to manage that line item in line with what we're seeing on the top line over time. Naturally, from a payroll standpoint, we continue to invest in the payroll line to deliver on the customer experience that our customers expect. And as the sales growth has been accelerated, we've tried to make sure that we put the hours in and the labor into our stores to be able to deliver on that promise and that experience, and it's been successful for us. And quite frankly, it's driving our top line growth.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich of Evercore. Greg, please ask your question.\nGreg Melich: Congrats on a great year and quarter, guys. The inflation number of 11% for this company in DIY, you said ticket was up eight. Is it fair to say that the difference between the 11 and the eight is all just items in the basket at DIY? Or is there some -- there's inflation that's less in retail\nJamere Jackson: It's basket and mix that are driving the difference there.\nGreg Melich: Okay. So I should assume inflation is the same in DIY?\nJamere Jackson: That's right.\nGreg Melich: And then the second question is, and maybe it ties a little bit into the margins in LIFO. Any thoughts in terms of how far AP inventory can go? Any changes in terms there? If you did, would that help you get some more of these products in certain categories? How should we think about the AP inventory ratio?\nJamere Jackson: We have a strong program that are driving the AP to inventory numbers. The other thing I'll point to is that our turns are elevated relative to where we've been historically, 1.5x versus probably being somewhere in the 1.2x to 1.3x. And that's given us some goodness there in terms of the AP inventory ratio. It may move around a few points or so, but we're going to continue to be aggressive on the programs that we've put in place.\nGreg Melich: And my last one would be trade down. Is there any sign of that? You talked a lot about the strength in commercial in Duralast Gold and Elite, but if you look across the box, including DIY, are we seeing consumers starting to shift anywhere?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, it's a great question, Greg. It's something that we have been studying really since probably May. We have seen it at times on the margin. But really -- I mean, we've really looked for it hard. We have not seen it in mass by any stretch of the imagination at this point in time.\nOperator: Okay. I'm going to hand back over to Bill now. We have finished the question-and-answer section. Bill, over to you.\nBill Rhodes: Okay. Well, before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position, and our business model we know is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress again that it's a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to recognize our AutoZoners for their tremendous success this past year. They far exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the year and in a very challenging environment as our pledge states put our customers first, resulting in additional share gains and terrific sales performance on top of fantastic results in FY '21. We grew our overall sales of 11.1% on top of 15.8% growth last year, resulting in a two-year growth that is among the highest we've ever experienced. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. This year began with the resurgence of the pandemic, ongoing supply chain challenges, a very difficult staffing environment and finished with rising interest rates and inflation at its highest levels in decades, all as major storylines. Throughout the year, our team's incredible supply chain efforts to improve our in-stock position, likely at industry-leading levels, helped our sales growth. These efforts resulted in a positive retail comp and an exceptionally strong commercial comp for both the quarter and the year. Any way you evaluate our FY '22 performance, we had a terrific year. Congratulations AutoZoners, and thanks for always putting our customers first, which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q4 overall same-store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for FY '23. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 6.2% this quarter on top of last year's 4.3%. On a two-year basis, we delivered 10.5% comp and on a three-year basis, a remarkable 32.3% stacked comp. Our team once again executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons and significant challenges I mentioned above. Our growth rates for commercial and retail were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 20%. This quarter was our sixth consecutive commercial growth above 20%. Additionally, Commercial set a fourth quarter record with $1.442 billion in sales, an impressive accomplishment. We generated $260 million more in sales this quarter than in Q4 last year. For the fiscal year, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion versus $3.3 billion just a year ago, up over 26%. Last fall, at our National Sales Meeting, our Senior VP of Commercial, Grant McGee, declared a stretched goal to achieve $4 billion in sales for FY '22. That lofty goal ultimately was a near lofty enough. We also set a record average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $17,000 per store versus $14,400 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 26% in last year's quarter. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store inventory, massive improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being quote priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team's performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.1% comp this quarter. While our two-year comp decelerated from Q3's, we believe the more relevant comp is the three-year and we are higher than last year's quarter at 24.5% versus 21.6%. For the year, we were very proud of our DIY results considering we grew so much in FY '21. To level set, we had 11% DIY comp in FY '21. And for the full year '22, we were up 2.9%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison, which was driven by the various forms of stimulus last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous share gains in dollars and more importantly, in units that we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY '23. Now let's focus on sales cadence. Our quarter spans 16 weeks, early May through the end of August. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first four weeks to high single digits, 8.4%. The next eight weeks, our growth was nearly halved, dropping to 4.9%. And then. it reaccelerated over the last four weeks, up 6.8%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are difficult to interpret as so much was going on last year and even the year before. However, for Q4, our two-year comp was 10.5% and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 10.4%, 9.4%, 7.9% and 14.4%, respectively. But our three-year comp was 32.3% and for the four-week periods of the quarter increased 35.2%, 33.5%, 30.1% and 31%, respectively. We have been encouraged by the sustainability of the enormous sales gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Regarding weather in May and June, we experienced slightly cooler and wetter weather trends across the country. By July, however, it became very hot across most of the country, and it remained unseasonably warm for August. Overall, we feel weather had a small but slightly positive effect on our sales performance. As we look forward to the fall months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, cold or hot, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down roughly 7%, while our ticket was up about 8%. Our transaction count decline wasn't surprising and was driven by lower demand for discretionary sales floor items. However, we were pleased to be in line with last quarter's three-year transaction trends. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We're also very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Our sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers, along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. I regularly visit our stores and commercial customers and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our offerings. The reception our AutoZoners are receiving from our customers and as importantly, our prospective customers has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. I'll say it now, but we're determined, determined to continue to grow meaningfully faster than the market, and we're focused on future growth opportunities to keep our momentum. Our goal stated simply, overtime is to become the industry leader in both sectors. As we start our new fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the fall months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 30 basis point difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country with the Northeast and Midwest being higher. As the Northeast and Midwest were warmer in May and June, their sales accelerated. However, this trend reversed itself over the last eight weeks of the quarter. As the remainder of the country heated up, those regions grew their comp sales faster than the Northeast and Midwest markets. Heading into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we continue to believe weather will have only a minimal impact on our sales. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. While I said our same-store sales were up 6.2% versus last year's fourth quarter, our net income was $810 million and our EPS was $40.51 a share, increasing 13.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hot parts outperformed sales floor categories with approximately a 2.5% difference between them. As gas prices increased, our discretionary sales for merchandise categories certainly softened. The discretionary categories represent approximately 20% of our DIY sales in any one quarter. But this quarter, they were weaker at 19% of the retail mix. This category was down 6.5% in the quarter versus up 3.5% last year in Q4. More recently, as gas prices have abated, we are encouraged to see the discretionary categories bounce back a bit. In general, the categories that are driven by failure due to heat performed well, and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lapped very strong performance last year and exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this fall as we expect miles driven to improve while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 11% from inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was up about 10%. We believe both numbers for the first quarter will be similar. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We believe inflation is stabilizing. We are seeing transportation costs begin to moderate after reaching historic levels, but we are not seeing product cost deflation yet nor are we seeing any signs that labor wage growth is slowing. Importantly, I want to point out that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to midterm sales. What I previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a two- and three-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we've achieved in both sectors. Over the past 12 to 18 months, the overall macro environment has been favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for some of our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our first quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we are focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn, drive our sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new distribution centers domestically and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but they increase our capacity. We didn't expect to grow our business 30% in three years as we did, and that will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. I'm also excited to announce that we opened a new facility on the West Coast just this month to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs postponing the inventory allocation and therefore, reducing safety stock. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more product closer and closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses and almost 800 stores open internationally, these businesses had impressive performance this past fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the new year. Last night, we kicked off our National Sales meeting with our amazing President's Club winners, our very best store managers. This week, we will embrace our theme for the year, Accelerate Together. We are very excited to have our field leadership team in Memphis for the next four days and I cannot wait to congratulate everyone on their year and thank them for their phenomenal results. They delivered exceptional results in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service heading into fiscal '23. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service and this is what will continue to define our success well into the future. As we've accelerated our top line, our competitive positioning has materially improved and customer behavior may have permanently changed post-pandemic. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, and it is a very long track record of strong performance with high returns and consistent cash flows. We would also encourage you to migrate to studying our performance on a one-year comp to gauge our performance as we believe the business is steady enough to talk about year-over-year comps going forward. This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. This year, in particular, is a rewarding experience. Our team delivered some really impressive milestones, $16.3 billion in sales racing past the $15 billion milestone. DIY comps of 2.9%, most impressively, 21.6% on a three-year basis. Commercial sales blew past $4 billion, ending at $4.23 billion. Average weekly sales domestically of $46,300 per store per week equating to over $2.4 million per store annually. Our Mexico and ALLDATA teams both broke numerous records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count. We bought back a record-breaking $4.4 billion in AutoZone stock, and our team has grown our EBIT by roughly 50% in three years. Yes, that's five-zero, and that is remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels, and we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure. Our greatest challenge, which we will spend time discussing this week with the team, is \"exiting pandemic mode.\" In addition to our fanatical customer focus and our phenomenal culture, a huge part of our historical success has been flawless execution. In all Candor, we haven't been flawlessly executing. In the depths of the pandemic, it was impossible and our teams appropriately made trade-offs. We have ensured that some of those trade-offs do not result in \"new norms or worse, numbness or bad habits.\" Those new norms can't and won't be tolerated. We have to make sure our in-stock levels finally recover to our historic levels and they recover soon. Our vendors must return to providing us with the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function correctly always. We have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine we have always been an exit pandemic mode. I've had the honor of being part of this team for nearly 28 years now, and it has been one of the great privileges of my life. I could not be more proud of our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to passionately serving our customers. We must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success and rest assured, we are doing just that. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our team at AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you, Bret. It's still quite challenging. And it's moved. I've talked about it over time. It moves from one category to another one. Most of our hard part categories, we're in pretty good shape on. We have some challenges in areas like filtration. But generally, we're in pretty good shape, but we are still a couple of points behind our overall in-stock rate that we had before the pandemic. It's been very stubborn, frankly. We're looking to push through it. But every time we think we've got it solved in other category rears its ugly head. Sure. Well, first, on the latter part of the question, we addressed it a little bit in our prepared remarks that when gas prices were $5.50 a gallon on average across the country, we saw an immediate reduction in our discretionary products. As those gas prices have come back down, we've seen discretionary products improve. You have to be careful because it's such a small part of our business, but we've certainly seen it improve. As for whether or not we can see positive comps in DIY for FY '23, as you know, we don't give guidance. There's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace with inflation, with rising interest rates and the like. But I will tell you -- I'll answer it this way. This latter part of the fourth quarter was much stronger than we were expecting it to be in June and July. And so that gives us some confidence that at least for now, the DIY business is really quite strong. And frankly, as strong if not stronger than we thought it would be back in the early months of the summer. I think the strategies that we're focused on for the next chapter of growth are the same ones that we've been working on for about five years. We're going to continue to make sure that we've got the best coverage in the marketplace. That considers being in the best situation in the local store. It also means expansion of hubs and mega-hubs. We've talked about growing our mega-hubs from today's 78 to 200. So, we're just over -- just under 40% of the way there, and we're moving pretty quickly. Same kind of trajectory on the hub stores, we're around 200. We want to get to 300 of those. So we have lots of growth still in front of us on hubs and mega-hubs, and we're continuing to test new philosophies and new coverage even in those. We're going to continue to focus on the Duralast brand. We're leveraging technology to make our people more efficient and to reduce our delivery times. We're always making sure that we're priced strike. We've got a lot of different strategies, and that's the thing to me that's most encouraging is it's not one single thing that's making this happen. It's a holistic substantial improvement in our competitive positioning in the marketplace. At the end of the day, we got around 4% share in commercial. I said on the call today, the first time we've ever said it. We want to win and be the largest in both sectors. And it's going to take us a while, but that's our goal. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've had with 20% growth over six consecutive quarters, that's pretty phenomenal regardless of how the industry is growing. Simeon, you followed us for a lot of years, and you've heard me say many times that the dirty little secret of our industry is that there's downward pressure on units and have been for decades. So oftentimes, we'll be down 3% or 4% in units and customer count. A lot of that is driven by improvements in automobile technology. So easy example is spark bugs. He used to buy spark bugs and they were copper spark bugs and they would last for 30,000 miles. Now you buy Iridium spark bugs and they last 100,000 miles. Now the old copper spark bugs used to cost $0.59. Now Iridium's are oftentimes over $10. So, there's an upward pressure on cost or peaks -- price per piece and a downward pressure on units. I think our downward pressure in the fourth quarter was more exaggerated than it typically is, mainly because of the incredible performance that we've seen over the last three years. I think there's been some moderation. There was also a little bit of moderation as we said, because of the discretionary items, accessories and the like. Is that helpful? Jamere, let me jump in and amplify a couple of points, too. First of all, I've been involved with this company since before we went public in 1991. This is the first time we've ever had a LIFO charge period. These are uncertain times or unique dynamics, especially with the level of inflation that we've seen in cargo freight going from $1,800 to over $20,000 per container. Those numbers have moderated significantly now, but we do have some long term -- or some midterm contracts, call them 6 to 12 months where we had to secure capacity. It is our full expectation -- and I don't know if it will happen this year or not. It's going to depend on freight costs. It is our full anticipation whatever charges we take in Q1 and Q2 ultimately will be reversed, and we will go back to zero and then we'll start building a LIFO reserve that we don't record. So, we think this $100 million to $200 million charge will be temporary, and it will reverse and it could be -- the back half of this year, could be next year, but that is fully our expectation. Yes. I don't want to specifically say 52% gross margins is what the future is going to look like. As you've seen, there are pressures on gross margin as we continue to grow this commercial business at such an accelerated rate. That pressure is likely going to continue. But just like you said, the GAAP charge, let's just say, it was $200 million for the first half of the year. A year from now or 18 months from now, you're also going to have to think about when that $200 million comes back through the P&L. And so, we would encourage you to look at it, excluding the LIFO charges, both as it's a penalty for us now and when it's a benefit for us whenever that happens. Yes. Terrific questions, Kate. I'll take the last one first. Duralast continues to perform exceptionally well in the DIFM sector. We've rolled it into more categories. In the last few years, we've rolled it into shocks and struts. We've rolled out a Duralast Gold type performance chassis program, and we've rolled out Duralast elite brake pads. Each of these have been well received in both the retail and the commercial market, where 10 years ago, everybody would say, we couldn't be successful in commercial because of the Duralast brand. I think, the exact opposite is true. It has become a real strength for us. Remind me the first part of your question, sorry. Yes, sorry. I think they're very, very similar. Both are doing very well. There's not a discernible difference between the two right now. Yes. First of all, we've been -- thanks for the question. Terrific. We've been direct importing for years. We've got a strong team of people in China today and import from China and Taiwan and Vietnam and Turkey and India. We've got a very robust direct import program that will continue to grow, and it's been a very important part of us managing our product cost over long periods of time. What we're doing today is we're going to make it more efficient for us. So, we've opened in the beginning stages of opening a direct import facility in California. We also announced that we're going to be opening a new distribution center in New Kent, Virginia and attached to that new distribution center will also be a direct import facility. What this is going to allow us to do is continue to import, but instead of having to buy in quantities that are going to ship from China or Turkey or India by distribution center, we're going to flow them into this direct import facility and it allows us to do postponement on the allocation of the inventory by probably 45 days, which will make us be able to reduce our safety stock in a significant way and make us more efficient. I'm really excited about this new program. Yes, it's a great question, Greg. It's something that we have been studying really since probably May. We have seen it at times on the margin. But really -- I mean, we've really looked for it hard. We have not seen it in mass by any stretch of the imagination at this point in time. Okay. Well, before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position, and our business model we know is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress again that it's a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable fourth quarter last year with 6.2% domestic comp growth, a 5.7% increase in EBIT and a 13.4% increase in EPS. Our results for the entire fiscal year were incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $5.3 billion, up 8.9%. For the year, our total sales were $16.3 billion, up 11.1% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY '19. Our sales are up an amazing 37% or nearly $4.4 billion since 2019. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 22% to $1.4 billion and were up 43.2% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $17,000, up 18.1% as we exceeded our internal expectations. Our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 87% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 66 net new programs finishing with 5,342 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY '22 and our results in the fourth quarter and year reflected this dynamic. For FY '22, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion, up 26.5% versus last year. Importantly, we believe we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we're delivering on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing an exceptional service has enabled us to deliver double-digit sales growth for the past eight quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And as I've noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 78 mega-hub locations with 11 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $17,000 per program, the 78 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial front. In fact, our commercial mega-hub business grew at twice the rate of our overall commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lift the entire network. This strategy is working. We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by our objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. We're targeting up to 25 new mega-hubs in FY '23. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited, and we're determined to build on our strong momentum. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business comp was up 1.1% in Q4. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 7% from last year's traffic levels. However, we also saw 8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. For FY '22, our DIY comp grew 2.9% and 14.1% on a two-year stack basis. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continue to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injections and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady throughout the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY '23. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 30 new stores in Mexico to finish with 703 stores and 14 new stores in Brazil, ending with 72. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 73 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and a 28 basis points headwind stemming from a non-cash $15 million LIFO charge. I'd like to address the $50 million LIFO charge we took this past quarter, which came from the exhaustion of our reserve balance that occurred during the quarter. The level set, we went from a $335 million reserve balance in Q4 of last year to zero in Q4 this year, plus an additional $15 million charge. Said differently, we recognized $350 million in higher costs this past year. Basically, all the reduction in our reserves came from higher inventoriable freight costs. This charge does not show up in our cash flow statement this quarter because the accounting for LIFO will adjust the weighted average cost through the P&L to the last in higher-priced items. In a nutshell, it assumes everything you sold in the quarter was at the last and higher prices. We're still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, which in turn means we are modeling LIFO charges through the first half of the new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we anticipate up to $100 million in LIFO charges, and we're forecasting a similar amount for the second quarter. I will note that if freight costs abate as we expect them to, then we'll see these charges reverse and we'll begin to rebuild a LIFO reserve balance. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 12 basis points driven by strong sales growth. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 5.7% versus the prior year's quarter driven by our strong sales growth. FY '22, EBIT was just under $3.3 billion, up 11.1% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, up 10.1% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.1 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q4 end last year. We're planning interest in the $55 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $43.3 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.1% and flat with last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 70 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 215 basis points. For the first quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $810 million, up 3.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $20 million was 9.1% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $40.51, up 13.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For FY '22, net income was $2.4 billion, up 11.9% and earnings per share was $117.19, up 23.1%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, spent $300 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $900 million of free cash flow. For the year, we generated $2.5 million in free cash versus $2.9 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow versus last year was due to a change in working capital this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 18.4% versus Q4 last year and total inventory increased 21.5% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our growth initiatives and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $240,000 versus negative $203,000 last year and negative $216,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.5% versus last year's Q4 of 129.6%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $1.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 10% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage metric finished Q4 at 2.1x EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target during FY '23. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and a fast-growing commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill. No, we're not seeing anything changed in terms of pricing cadence. We've been very disciplined about the pricing that we put in the marketplace. Again, we've been pricing to recover inflation and been doing that pretty consistently. And as I've said before, our industry has been very disciplined over time as it relates to this, and we're not seeing anything that throws us out of whack there. Yes, Simeon. So what we're modeling right now, as we said, is up to $100 million in the first quarter due primarily to higher freight. We are starting to see freight moderate some in the spot markets. However, what I'll remind you is that when we were in this environment of trying to make sure that we had capacity, we were incurring higher freight charges just so that we could secure capacity. So as those short-term contracted capacity dynamics happen from freight start to roll off, we'll start to see the benefits of what we're starting to see in the marketplace, which is a moderating freight market. You could see this in the back half get better, barring any disruptions. But right now, from a forecast standpoint, we're modeling somewhere in the neighborhood of close to $100 million in the first quarter and something similar in the second quarter. From a pricing standpoint, what we've said is that when there's hyperinflation on things like freight, where, for example, container costs went up 7x what we normally pay and then spike back down over time, you typically don't price to recover those kinds of spikes. What you do is you wait for the market to sort of moderate and your price accordingly to what you see the long-term impacts are going to be. So, we're continuing to price in a disciplined way. We're monitoring what's happening in the freight markets. It will come back. It's already starting to come back. And what you'll see is that we'll get credits coming back through the P&L to offset the charges that I've talked about for the first and the second quarter. And then as we get back to our normal market conditions, you'll see us rebuild that reserve balance over time. From an operating standpoint, we will be spot on the algorithm that we've typically had. You do have some dynamics associated with LIFO this year where if you model in a couple of quarters of LIFO charges in the $100 million range, it will have a non-operating impact on our gross margins. So if you're thinking about modeling it that way, then certainly, that's potentially the case. But we'll come back to you. We'll be very transparent about what we're seeing. As we said, we're starting to see some moderation in the dynamics that are causing us to take a LIFO charge. As we get through the first and the second quarter, we could see some moderation there and that could change how you ultimately end up for the fiscal year. But what I want to make sure that people understand is that this certainly is an operational deficiency. It's simply non-cash LIFO accounting. And we're continuing to run the business in a very disciplined way, which means that as we've seen pricing impacts on our product costs, we're continuing to take pricing. We'll continue to drive our growth initiatives. We're going to be a very strong cash flow generator. And the most important part of the operating model in our mind is that cash is going to mean that we're going to invest in our business, and we're going to return a meaningful amount of that to shareholders this year. Well, from a comp cadence standpoint, a couple of things I'll point you to is, remember, the first two quarters of last year, we have well over 13% domestic comps. And those are toughest two quarters from a comp standpoint and then you start to see that comp sort of moderate in the back half of the year. And we encourage you for the full year to look at our comps on a year-over-year basis. And the things that we've talked about is, again, we have a resilient DIY business, albeit in a marketplace that has some volatility and some uncertainty associated with it. We've been very disciplined and our growth initiatives are delivered. And then probably the most important part of our story is the commercial story where we're continuing to see accelerated growth in commercial, driven by all the initiatives that Bill talked about and the fact that we're a four or five share in a large and growing market. So, that's how you should think about our comps. And again, the first half comps obviously are going to be a little bit tougher just given the fact that we printed over 13% in the first two quarters of last year. They don't. A couple of things I'll point you to. One is we've been at roughly a 2.1x metric. So, we have a lot of dry powder to get back to our 2.5x metric. We continue to stress that as we move through this period where our business has grown on an accelerated basis, and we have confidence in our growth prospects going forward. And we're going to move back closer to or at that 2.5x target. So that gives us a lot of financial firepower to, first of all, invest in our existing assets and grow our business, but also to give meaningful amounts back to our shareholders. So you'll see us continue to drive free cash flow and get our leverage metrics back to the 2.5x. And that means that we'll be able to do some exciting things for shareholders in the future. We've continued to run the playbook that we've always run inside the Company on SG&A, where we're very disciplined about cost. We tend to try to run our SG&A line to be somewhat close to what we're seeing from a sales standpoint. And so, there's a laundry list of tactics that we run every single year to make sure that we're delivering productivity from an SG&A standpoint. Every function is involved in that. So it isn't just the store functions that are a part of that. And those are the things that are, quite frankly, give us a lot of confidence that we're able to manage that line item in line with what we're seeing on the top line over time. Naturally, from a payroll standpoint, we continue to invest in the payroll line to deliver on the customer experience that our customers expect. And as the sales growth has been accelerated, we've tried to make sure that we put the hours in and the labor into our stores to be able to deliver on that promise and that experience, and it's been successful for us. And quite frankly, it's driving our top line growth. It's basket and mix that are driving the difference there. That's right. We have a strong program that are driving the AP to inventory numbers. The other thing I'll point to is that our turns are elevated relative to where we've been historically, 1.5x versus probably being somewhere in the 1.2x to 1.3x. And that's given us some goodness there in terms of the AP inventory ratio. It may move around a few points or so, but we're going to continue to be aggressive on the programs that we've put in place."

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization continues to take this responsibility seriously and I am very proud of how our team continues to respond to COVID-19 and subsequent variants. While mass mandates have abated, we continue to make sure the environments our AutoZoners are working in and our customers are shopping in are as safe as possible for these times. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers, especially for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has meant for all of us. This quarter, we will start the same, by again thanking our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service, while helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic same-store sales were a solid 2.6% this quarter, on top of last year\u2019s very strong 28.9%. On both a 2-year and 3-year stack comp sales basis, our trends accelerated. Our team, once again, executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 26%. Commercial set a third quarter record with $1.044 billion in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $216 million more in sales this quarter than in Q3 of just last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our commercial sales are just under $4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $16,600 versus $13,500 last year. On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 24.8% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host of key initiatives. We have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We are also very proud of our organization\u2019s performance in domestic DIY. As a reminder, it was last year\u2019s Q3 that had the massive stimulus payments that were distributed to consumers in the U.S. We ran a negative 4.5% comp this quarter on top of last year\u2019s record positive comps of 24.8%. While our DIY 2-year comp decelerated slightly from Q2\u2019s 2-year DIY comp, perhaps the more relevant comp is the DIY 3-year comp, which did accelerate. We were very proud of our DIY results considering we had such a tough comparison to last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous share gains in dollars and units we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of the massive elevated sales levels we have experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. Now, let\u2019s focus on the sales cadence. Our quarter spans at 12-week period. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first 4 weeks, up 11.8%. Then they were down over the middle 4 weeks by 5.2%. But remember, we were comping against the stimulus payments made during this time last year and our same-store sales then accelerated over the last 4 weeks, up 3%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are really difficult to interpret us so much is going on last year and even the year before. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 31.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 23.4%, 65.4% and 17% respectively. But our 3-year comp was 30.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 29.7%, 44.7% and 29.8% respectively. What I want to stress is that our 2-year and 3-year comp accelerated for the quarter from Q2\u2019s 2 and 3-year comparison. We are encouraged by the sustainability of these enormous sales gains. Regarding weather, in February and March, we experienced normal weather trends across the country. April, however, was a little cooler and a little wetter than normal. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the summer months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, hot or cold, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding the quarter\u2019s traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was down roughly 8.5%, while our ticket was up 4%. Our transaction count decline was correlated to last year\u2019s Q3 meaningful 16% traffic count increase. While we had expected a decline in transactions this quarter, we were pleased to exceed our beginning of the quarter assumptions on transaction count declines. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We are very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Most of the sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers. I have visited our stores and commercial customers extensively this quarter and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our comprehensive offerings. The tone of our sales calls has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. As we start our final quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the summer months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 54 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and Midwest performing lower. As the Northeast and Midwest were cooler and wetter in April, their sales were below last year\u2019s results. We do not believe there will be lasting effects on sales performance in the Northeast and Midwest due to the slightly cooler April weather. Heading into the fourth quarter, we continue to believe weather will have a minimal effect on summer sales. Now, let\u2019s move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 2.6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our net income was $593 million and our EPS was $29.03 a share, increasing 9.6%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed our sales floor categories, but there was less than a 1% difference between them. As gas prices jumped recently, our sales results in certain hard parts categories performed below our plan. This is unlike the sales floor categories, which were on plan. We have been especially pleased with our growth rates in many of our categories like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year and easily exceeded our planned assumptions for the quarter. We believe our hard parts business will strengthen as our customers return to driving more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 7.8% from inflation, in line with the cost of goods inflation, which was up similarly at 7.2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers for the fourth quarter could be slightly higher than this past quarter\u2019s increases. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower ultimate cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to mid-term sales. What I have previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a 2-year stacked comp basis and a 3-year stacked comp basis. While it\u2019s difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team\u2019s exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long-term. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I\u2019d like to make sure the listeners know what our key business priorities are for the remainder of the fiscal year and give some color on those. First, we are focusing on our supply chain. We have two initiatives in place to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We believe intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn continued to drive our sales performance. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced opening two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduced drive times to stores and markets serviced by the new DCs, but they, being larger than the previous DCs, will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. We previously relied on our vendor community to carry these SKUs and shipped them once ordered by our stores. Our DC strategy is focused on carrying more product in our supply chain that was not available previously. These SKUs will smartly expand our stocked inventory across all 50 states. And lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico business, while accelerating growth in Brazil and we are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable third quarter last year, with 2.6% comp growth, a 2% decline in EBIT and a 9.6% increase in EPS. Our results for the first three quarters of the fiscal year have been incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.9 billion, up 5.9% and total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.8 billion, up 5.7%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 26% to over $1 billion and were up 70.4% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,600, up 23% as we averaged just over $87 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, growth at 26% exceeded our internal expectations and was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter represented the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better than expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 43 net new programs, finishing with 5,276 total programs. As I have said since the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY \u201822 and our results in the third quarter and year-to-date reflect this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategy and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little color on our progress here. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 67 Mega-Hub locations and we expect to open approximately 11 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,600 per program, the 67 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. This quarter, I visited one of our key markets where we are testing greater mega hub density. And although it\u2019s early innings, I am thrilled with the results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. This strategy is working and we are doubling down by raising our near-term mega hub target from approximately 110 to 200 mega hubs, supplemented by our new objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. Yes, we plan to have 500 total locations, with significantly higher levels of expanded parts availability and soon. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we are expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners are excited, our customers are excited and we are building a meaningful competitive advantage. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down 4.5%, but up 20.3% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained significant market share since the start of the pending. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 8.5% from last year\u2019s record traffic levels that were fueled by government stimulus. However, we also saw a 4% ticket growth as we continue to methodically raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen behind our growth initiatives in a favorable macro environment. On a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which are providing a strong tailwind for our business. Our in-stock positions, while still below historic norms, continue to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We\u2019ve been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our DIY business remains strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we\u2019ve had great execution by our teams. Now I\u2019ll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 673 stores, and three new stores in Brazil, ending with 58. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 12% of our total store base now outside the U.S., and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 54 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where mix drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 4.8%, a welcome trade-off that is a net positive for our business. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we\u2019re continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.8% versus last year Q3 as SG&A, as a percentage of sales, deleveraged 114 basis points. The deleverage was driven by payroll as last year\u2019s historic DIY comp drove significant and more than appropriate leverage on SG&A, where we simply couldn\u2019t staff to the accelerated sales growth fast enough. We also continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends and user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $786 million, down 2.2% and versus the prior year\u2019s quarter, driven by last year\u2019s strong sales performance in DIY. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.9 million, down 7% from Q3 a year ago, although our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter was $6.1 million versus $5.3 billion in Q3 last year. We\u2019re planning interest in the $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $58.1 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 21.4% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 284 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 211 basis points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, down 0.6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of $20.4 million was 9.3% lower than last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $29.03, up 9.6% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $843 million of operating cash flow and spent $161 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $682 million in free cash flow. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, down 13% versus the prior year. The primary reason for the decline in free cash flow versus last year is the timing of merchandise inventories and payments this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward. We remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q3 last year. Total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation and our growth initiatives. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $216,000 versus negative $167,000 last year and negative $198,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 127.9% versus last year\u2019s Q3 of 123.9%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At quarter end, we had just under $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash flow we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We\u2019ve bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q3 at 2.1x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDA. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target when appropriate. To wrap up, we had another very successful quarter. We\u2019re driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We\u2019re growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. We had very solid results so far in fiscal \u201822, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service, and this is what we will continue to define our success well into the future. And looking to the future, it is still very difficult to predict the next 6 to 12 months. But our perspective has meaningfully morphed over the last two quarters. On last quarter\u2019s call, we discussed how most, if not all, of the growth in sales we experienced since the start of the pandemic was sustainable. We believed our competitive positioning was materially improved, as indicated by our significant retail share gains and rapidly accelerated commercial sales growth. We believe customer behavior may have permanently changed. We continue to believe all of this today. If this holds true, it will be the 4th time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have been through significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique and it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we have now lapped the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we have all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and took several months. For Q4, in light of the amazing performance in the back half of 2020, the 2-year comparison for overall comps won\u2019t be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to studying 3-year comps to gauge our fourth quarter performance. That said, soon, we look forward to returning to focusing solely on 1 year comparisons. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas, they want to get out and drive, and we are here when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. We continue to believe we are better in stock than most retailers, and I think our results obviously support that belief. I\u2019d like to share a few other points with you. It has been a rather noisy earnings season for retailers, and I want to be clear, crystal clear about our business and the environment. First, I believe AutoZone can manage effectively through this inflationary environment. Historically, our industry has been disciplined and rational about passing along cost increases with higher retails and that is true today. Second, we feel our store staffing levels are appropriate, and we can, and we will manage expenses appropriately for either stronger or weaker sales environment. Our business and our industry has been remarkably resilient and, frankly, robust. For the remainder of fiscal \u201822, we are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. Last quarter, we announced we would begin construction on three new distribution centers to fuel continued growth, two in the U.S. and one in Mexico. Expected to open in fiscal \u201824, these new distribution centers represent a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in DCs as during the pandemic, we\u2019ve learned we need to have more excess capacity. Secondly, we are targeting to open 11 more new domestic mega hub in the U.S. in this quarter, Q4. These mega hubs will enhance our availability and support growth in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability, and our results show that they are working. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. Our fourth quarter will be a busy one from a store development standpoint. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret, you line is live.\nBret Jordan: Good morning, guys.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: On the mega hubs, could you talk maybe about the geographic reach? You noted that the DIFM is accelerating in their markets. I mean how far can they support smaller stores geographically?\nBill Rhodes: Well, frankly, Bret, they are supporting smaller and smaller radius of geography today than they did before because we were getting so many of them. When we first built them, it was not uncommon for them to be supporting stores that were 2, 3, maybe even 400 miles away. A lot of times, that would be on an overnight basis. The real crux of it is, how do we get the stores that are in, call it, 30 or 40 miles away from the mega hub, and how can we get them service 3x a day. That\u2019s when we really performed well. But the biggest part of the mega hub performance is the mega hub itself. The four walls of the mega hubs are just continuing. Every time we look at them, and every time we open some and open more, they continue to outperform our expectations. And one of the remarkable things is they are not cannibalizing close-in stores like we thought they would. So as we talked on the last call, remember when we first launched the mega hubs, we said we would have 25 to 40. We\u2019re now in the 60s, and we\u2019re headed to 200. That just goes to show you the power of these mega hubs.\nBret Jordan: Great. And then one quick follow-up. You noted some impact on hard parts maybe correlated to higher fuel prices year-to-date. Are you seeing any trade down, whether it be in the Do-It-For-Me or the DIY space, given what\u2019s going on in inflationary to the consumer?\nBill Rhodes: Sure. Yes. We\u2019re hearing a lot of questions about what\u2019s going on with the low-end consumer, are people trading down? Our hard parts business, I don\u2019t want to overstate that. I mean, I think I said it was off about 1% during that. It is very difficult right now to get clarity on the comparisons. Let\u2019s remember \u2013 some people are talking about weather. We\u2019re saying we don\u2019t think weather was a meaningful impact on our business. What was meaningful was, we went up against stimulus from March of last year that lasted for 4 to 6 weeks. That is really the story. And so it\u2019s hard to say the low-end consumer, sure their purchases are down versus last year, of course they are. They had a massive amount of stimulus in their pocket. I think it will be interesting to see what happens over the fourth quarter. Are we watching what happens with the low-end consumer? Absolutely. But I also want to remind you the comment that I made at the end. If you think about the \u2013 over the last 30 years, there is been four significant shocks to the economy. In all four of those shocks, our performance and our industry\u2019s performance has made a meaningful step up during those shocks, recessions and pandemics that our business has gone up, and it\u2019s never stepped back down.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you, Bret.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Christopher Hoover with JPMorgan. Christopher, your line is live.\nChristopher Hoover: Thank you. So a few questions on the gross margin front. As you look ahead, there\u2019re some headwinds that seem to be emerging on the fuel side. How do you think about pricing and fuel cost pressures in terms of product pricing? And then your success in commercial obviously has some expense on gross margin rate. So given those two factors, would you think that gross margin continues to see the type of year-over-year headwinds that you saw in the current quarter and the past couple of quarters?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. On the first part of your question, I mean, there is no question, we\u2019re seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We\u2019re also seeing higher transportation costs. We\u2019re seeing higher fuel costs. However, as we reiterated on the call, the industry pricing is rational, and we\u2019re actually pricing to recover all of those inflationary impacts, just as we\u2019ve done in the past. So you\u2019ve seen us move retail prices up. As inflation has moved up mid-single digits, our pricing has moved. I think our entire industry has done that. And as I\u2019ve said before, inflation has been a little bit of our friend in terms of what we see in terms of retail pricing. Now as it relates to our commercial business, we want to be crystal clear. Our goal is to create a faster growing business with higher margin dollars. This is a much more sustainable way for us to grow our cash and, ultimately, shareholder value. Our domestic commercial business grew 26%. It\u2019s a mix headwind. We expect our domestic commercial business to continue to outgrow our DIY business, and that\u2019s a trade-off that we welcome. We will continue to run a very disciplined playbook on margin expansion opportunities across all of our business, which includes things that we\u2019re doing from a cost standpoint, raising our prices and managing our expenses accordingly. But we like the fact that we\u2019ve got a commercial business with very strong operating margins that is accretive to the overall business.\nChristopher Hoover: Understood. That\u2019s great. And then my other question is somewhat technical. As you think about the fuel impact of the trucks and the cars going from the store to the shops and the mechanics, where does that show up in your P&L? Is that an SG&A item? And how do you think about your \u2013 the ability to maybe price that in or offset that impact? Because clearly, diesel and gas accelerated over the quarter, and that impact should be bigger as you look forward.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. If you look at diesel in particular, it\u2019s up probably 50% versus a year ago. That does show up in our SG&A expenses. So as we\u2019re running the cost playbook and we\u2019re running our pricing playbook, we have to take all of those things into account. And as I said before, when we look at our business in total, and look at all of the inflationary impacts, we\u2019re pricing our retails accordingly to make sure that we maintain our margin structure going forward.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Just for clarity, there is pressure in both gross margin and SG&A. The majority of the diesel is in the warehouse and distribution costs, which is in gross profit. And then our \u2013 we have one of the largest light-duty fleets in our commercial and field management folks. And so there is a lot of pressure in SG&A as well.\nChristopher Hoover: Right. And then the idea is you\u2019re going to manage pricing to help offset that the light-duty expense pressure in SG&A?\nJamere Jackson: That\u2019s right.\nBill Rhodes: Both of them, both the light-duty and the heavy-duty.\nChristopher Hoover: Got it. Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nBill Rhodes: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning everyone. My first question is on some of the margin and growth comments Jamere just made. Given the success you have in DIFM, are you making trade-offs between how much quicker you can grow and the margin dilution? And then meaning can you grow even quicker and maybe a bigger detriment to margin or are you seeing less detriment to margin as this expansion is happening in commercial?\nBill Rhodes: I will say it crystal clear. No, we are not constraining our growth based upon the margin characteristics of the DIFM business. We set it for 1 million years. DIFM today operates at lower gross margins and lower operating margins. But it grows \u2013 it operates in operating margins the way we look at it on generally an incremental basis in the mid-teens. We will grow that business as fast as humanly possible. If we could add another $4 billion in sales and the corresponding operating income that comes with that tomorrow, with the limited amount of incremental capital that we have to deploy, we would do it tomorrow. We were very focused on operating profit dollars. And as we look forward, I would just encourage you all to look at our business from a gross margin point of view, how are we doing in DIY and how are we doing in commercial. Our goals will be to marginally increase those gross margins over time. If we do that and that puts \u2013 and the commercial business grows at 26% and it puts pressure on the overall gross margin, so be it.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And Bill, I was intrigued by some of the comments you made about some permanent changes to the industry. Were you underscoring how resilient the business is, or are you also thinking that maybe the business or the industry can grow at a faster rate than it has historically?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I don\u2019t know that I would say it can grow at a faster rate the industry itself. I clearly think that we can, and maybe some of our close-in competitors can grow faster in the commercial business because that is still so fragmented. But the bigger part of my point is this is the most remarkably resilient business I have ever seen. And I don\u2019t understand why, when we have a recession, our business goes up and we come out of it and our business never goes down. It seems to flat line and then grow from there. It\u2019s amazing to me.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you, Simeon.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you all for taking my question. The roads on the topic of recessionary environments and the impact that it has on the auto aftermarket is one of the drivers during those periods that people shift away from buying new cars and are more interested and need to maintain their existing cars? And so the dynamic this time around could be influenced by the fact that new cars that might used car sales have been depressed because of the supply constraints, so the industry might not see as much of a countercyclical boost as it\u2019s seen in the past?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I think all of that makes perfect sense, Michael. I wish we had empirical evidence that could tell us that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. I will tell you, if you asked me a year ago if we were going to retain the kind of sales gains that we had grown over the first 2 years of the pandemic, I would have said I doubt it. But there has also been other pressures that have happened. Clearly, the lack of new cars and the elevation of pricing, the radical elevation of pricing of used cars has our customers view on how long they are going to have that vehicle changing to much longer than it normally is. When that happens, they seem to take better care of their cars. I think we also didn\u2019t envision the inflation impact that we are seeing. And clearly, that\u2019s \u2013 I talked about some traffic declines, some significant traffic declines, 8.5% in the retail business. That was up against 16% traffic growth last year. I will take a 2-year comp of 7.5% traffic all day long, but inflation and the ability to pass that inflation on has helped us. That\u2019s another key element of this industry is the inelasticity of demand in this sector of retail is probably unparalleled. And so as this inflation has come through, it\u2019s helped us get through that period of time as well.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, you have clearly gained market share. If we compare your results to a variety of indicators, that\u2019s pretty obvious. And your messaging is that it\u2019s as a result of many different factors, one of which does seem to be that you have made some price investments initially on the DIY side, more recently on the DIFM side. One of your competitors has been vocal about making similar price investments on \u2013 especially on the DIFM side. So, at this point, do you feel the need to make further price investments, either on the DIY side or on the commercial side, either \u2013 in an effort to either maintain or grow all the share that you have gained in the last couple of years? Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: The short answer is absolutely no. The longer answer is, we made very marginal price investments on the retail business. We have far lapped those probably six months or so ago. They were very targeted to specific highly-visible commodity-related items, and we are focused on our comparisons versus mass. That\u2019s in the past. About this time last year, in fact, we have now annualized it. We completed rolling out the pricing changes that we made in our commercial business. Again, I want to be crystal clear. The growth that we saw in commercial over the last couple of years is not a result of pricing investments alone. They are an element. There is many other elements, the mega-hubs and hubs, the Duralast brand. We have rolled out \u2013 we had the single largest technology investment in the company\u2019s history focused on commercial and commercial deliveries. Our delivery times are dropping. So, we have done a lot of different things, and we lowered our pricings to make sure that we were focused on pricing versus a different competitive set. All that together has worked and has worked really, really well. At this point in time, we do not have any additional pricing actions being tested nor being considered. We believe we are very happy with our prices today in retail and commercial except that we need to pass inflation costs along as they come in. We will be very focused on trying to keep the same kinds of competitive positioning, but we need to pass on the inflation as it comes through us in costs.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Baker with Davidson.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks guys. I don\u2019t know if you can answer this, but just curious, why do you think weather didn\u2019t have an impact on your business? It had an impact on all your competitors\u2019 businesses and many other seasonal businesses. Why would your business be different, particularly as you over-index to DIY, which I think is probably a little bit more weather-sensitive than the commercial business?\nBill Rhodes: It\u2019s a very fair question. The information we have was, it was, as I have said, slightly cooler and slightly wetter. The real question \u2013 or the real discussion for this quarter was not weather it was stimulus. And I don\u2019t know how you fared out a 0.5 point or 1 point change in weather dynamics when you are talking about 2-year comps of 30% that were driven by stimulus. So, we are trying to focus on the major elements and make sure we communicate to you what we think are the real drivers, and frankly, the drivers that will help you understand our long-term trends. The weather was marginally different and I can\u2019t ferret it out in a 30% 2-year comp.\nMike Baker: Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then one other follow-up. You did say hard parts are down, you said only 100 basis points. So, you don\u2019t want to make too big of a deal of it, but you did say you thought it was because of gas prices. So, are you implying there \u2013 again, I don\u2019t want to make a big deal, but did you \u2013 do you think people are just driving less on the higher gas prices? And then you said that should get better, does it get better only when gas prices come back down, or should we\u2026?\nBill Rhodes: I think you had two elements that happened. You had two elements that happened to miles driven. We are still rebounding from the pandemic decrease of miles driven. Now you have got the gas prices implications. What we have seen historically in the past, Mike, is when gas prices hit $4 a gallon, you can see a direct correlation with those prices and a decline in miles driven. What we said historically as we have seen people when it gets to those elevated levels, they change their behavior. They change where they live, they change where they work. Obviously, with remote work and those kind of things, there could be different nuances this time. A lot of people are saying, yes, but $4 a gallon back then would be the equivalent to $5 whatever today, that may be true. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case or not. This has happened in pretty short order. And I think we need to watch what happens to miles driven over time. As we think about it, it will be a short-term phenomenon, just like it has been in the past. Our focus isn\u2019t about next quarter or even the quarter after that. And our focus, as I have said, is how do we think about driving this business to drive long-term cash flow at really high return rates and think out 3 years to 5 years. Gas prices will come and go, and it doesn\u2019t really impact how we manage the business day-to-day.\nMike Baker: Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. So, you have mentioned, obviously, the mega-hubs quite a few times and the positive impact that you see on your sales. Is there a way to potentially quantify the sales lift that you experienced in a market when you open a mega-hub?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. A couple of things stand out to us. As we said, as we have tested greater density, we are seeing two dynamics. One is the business plan that we build usually justifies the mega-hub based on what happens inside the four walls. And so we are seeing those sales be largely incremental, as Bill mentioned. We are not seeing the cannibalization. What we have tested is as we put more mega-hubs into the market and jam more parts in the market, those satellite stores are benefiting tremendously because they are leveraging the inventory and the availability from those mega-hubs, and they are seeing an overall lift as well. We haven\u2019t talked specifically about what the quantification is. But I can tell you that it\u2019s significant, and it is what\u2019s given us confidence to take our target from 110 to 200. And quite honestly, we will likely go beyond that as we continue to test and learn more in the future.\nScot Ciccarelli: And Jim, as the mega-hubs kind of mature, do they follow a new store maturity type curve?\nJamere Jackson: They do. But one of the things that we are experiencing right now, particularly with the growth in our commercial business, is that the ramp for the mega-hubs has been faster than what we have seen in the past. And that is because as we have put those additional parts into the marketplace, while we are doing all the work that Bill mentioned on our commercial acceleration initiatives, those mega-hubs are ramping up faster than we ever anticipated.\nScot Ciccarelli: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Daniel Imbro with Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey. Good morning guys and congrats on the quarter. Bill, I wanted to ask a higher-level question on the Do-It-For-Me side. So, obviously, you have been gaining share. But when you are not winning the business, from an operational standpoint, is there a consistent area of feedback you hear from customers where you need to improve, or any consistent learnings that you are seeing where you can still improve to gain more share when you are not winning that business?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. It\u2019s a really great question. I mentioned it in the call, and I have been out in the field a whole lot in the last three months. And the tone of the conversations with our commercial customers, be that national accounts at the senior leader level or in our commercial shops, has just \u2013 the tenor of the conversations have changed. It\u2019s a question of how can I give you more business versus the, age old things of, it was about availability, it was about the Duralast brand. The Duralast brand conversation has turned from a significant negative to a positive. And now, with our availability, it has meaningfully changed. So, I am not really hearing that we always can get better on delivery times. And if anybody wants to tell you why they are not giving you business, that\u2019s a very easy one. Well, now we have actual data that says, you are right, we are delivering to you too slow. Your average deliveries are 31 minutes and 37 seconds, and we apologize for that. We are going to work to get that better. And so we have got new tools at our disposal. We have got much better inventory assortments. The Duralast brand is amazing. And so the tenor of those conversations is really radically different than they were just 3 years or 4 years ago.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then Jamere, maybe more financial question, I know you just talked about the maturity curve of the new mega-hubs and DCs. But with three DCs coming online and 11 mega hubs, I guess in the near-term, what kind of SG&A pressure should we expect? I would assume there is inherent deleverage just from preopening costs and then as they ramp. So, kind of what kind of headwinds should we anticipate that puts on the SG&A line over the coming quarters?\nJamere Jackson: I mean it will clearly be some pressure on SG&A, but what I will say is that we have been very disciplined about managing our SG&A expenses. And quite frankly, when we have to make these kind of investments, number one, they have great payoffs associated \u2013 paybacks associated with them. But number two, we look for bill payers elsewhere in the P&L to be able to go do that. But what we have done over time, and what we will continue to do is, we invest in a very disciplined way in growth, and we are not afraid to de-lever SG&A if we need to, to support that growth, because in the long-term, it\u2019s the right thing for our business. So, we have a plan over time to manage SG&A in line with our sales growth. But in the short-term, you may see us spike it up from time-to-time to support the investments in growth. And we have done that not only with the capacity investments that you talked about, we have done it with our IT expenses over time, and we will continue to do that going forward.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck guys.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the comment you made about gross margin and just a hyper focus on mix and how that impacts your overall gross margin. How can we think about tracking improvements in margin in each of your categories? Like where will we see that show up in metrics?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I think two things you will see. Number one, we will continue to have mix pressure associated with our commercial business going forward. And we will be very transparent about what we see there. But all the playbook that we have historically run on managing gross margin, taking pricing actions in categories, driving down costs in certain categories, all those tactics will still be a play. And you will see us over time make positive improvements in gross margin. It\u2019s just that we are starting off in an environment where our commercial business is growing significantly faster than DIY, and that\u2019s going to be a margin pressure that we welcome because of the nature of the business and the fact that it\u2019s growing our overall gross profit dollars. So, we will be very transparent about it as we move forward, and it\u2019s a trade-off that we welcome.\nLiz Suzuki: Yes. That makes sense. And I mean is there a rule of thumb that we should think about as the differential in gross margin between commercial and retail in general?\nJamere Jackson: Well, it will depend on how fast the commercial business actually grows. If you look at the differential this quarter, it was significant, which actually drove gross margin deleverage this quarter. What I would say that if you were on an apples-to-apples basis in terms of growth rate, we would have actually seen gross margin be positive this quarter. But you have got the mix headwind there. It\u2019s a welcome trade-off and we are delivering.\nLiz Suzuki: Got it. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. With the elevated used vehicle pricing and lack of new cars available, just curious how you think that\u2019s impacted your addressable market? And to what extent scrap rates have declined out there with your customers? And as we inevitably go back to an environment where new cars come back on, or used vehicle prices start to come back down, to what extent do you think that would be a headwind for the industry?\nJamere Jackson: Well, I think you have got a dynamic here where, clearly, the macro environment associated with used cars is \u2013 has a significant impact on what you are seeing in the car park. The dynamic associated with new cars is similar. I mean our \u2013 if you look at the data on used cars, they are up 23% year-over-year, up 50% pre-pandemic. If you look at what\u2019s happening with dealer lots right now, they are probably carrying about a third of the inventory that they were pre-pandemic. So, it is a significant driver. What you are seeing though is that the car park is actually aging. People are hanging on to the vehicles longer. In fact the data that came out this morning shows that it\u2019s now ticked up to 12.2 years is the average age of a vehicle on the road. And those things are all producing a tailwind for us. I think what we are focused on as a business is, one, managing our business associated with the vehicles that are in operations, making sure that we have the assortment to go deal with that. And as there are changes in the car park, there are changes in technology, there are changes in consumer behavior, we just manage our business accordingly, and we have done that historically over time, and it\u2019s been a good outcome for us.\nZach Fadem: And then with the step-up in mega-hub density, is it fair to assume that double-digit commercial growth remains the norm for your business through fiscal \u201823? And do you view the opportunity ahead more about getting denser with existing customers or expanding your reach to newer customers that maybe you haven\u2019t been able to serve at this point?\nJamere Jackson: We will continue to see our commercial business have very strong growth. And the initiatives that we have talked about, whether it\u2019s the things that we are doing with assortment, the things that we have done with technology, the things that we have done with pricing, all of those things are driving significant growth in our commercial business, and we expect that trend to continue for us.\nZach Fadem: Thanks for the time.\nBill Rhodes: Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY \u201822, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country\u2019s heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans, a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization continues to take this responsibility seriously and I am very proud of how our team continues to respond to COVID-19 and subsequent variants. While mass mandates have abated, we continue to make sure the environments our AutoZoners are working in and our customers are shopping in are as safe as possible for these times. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers, especially for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has meant for all of us. This quarter, we will start the same, by again thanking our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service, while helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic same-store sales were a solid 2.6% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 28.9%. On both a 2-year and 3-year stack comp sales basis, our trends accelerated. Our team, once again, executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 26%. Commercial set a third quarter record with $1.044 billion in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $216 million more in sales this quarter than in Q3 of just last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our commercial sales are just under $4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $16,600 versus $13,500 last year. On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 24.8% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host of key initiatives. We have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We are also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. As a reminder, it was last year's Q3 that had the massive stimulus payments that were distributed to consumers in the U.S. We ran a negative 4.5% comp this quarter on top of last year's record positive comps of 24.8%. While our DIY 2-year comp decelerated slightly from Q2's 2-year DIY comp, perhaps the more relevant comp is the DIY 3-year comp, which did accelerate. We were very proud of our DIY results considering we had such a tough comparison to last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous share gains in dollars and units we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of the massive elevated sales levels we have experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. Now, let's focus on the sales cadence. Our quarter spans at 12-week period. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first 4 weeks, up 11.8%. Then they were down over the middle 4 weeks by 5.2%. But remember, we were comping against the stimulus payments made during this time last year and our same-store sales then accelerated over the last 4 weeks, up 3%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are really difficult to interpret us so much is going on last year and even the year before. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 31.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 23.4%, 65.4% and 17% respectively. But our 3-year comp was 30.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 29.7%, 44.7% and 29.8% respectively. What I want to stress is that our 2-year and 3-year comp accelerated for the quarter from Q2's 2 and 3-year comparison. We are encouraged by the sustainability of these enormous sales gains. Regarding weather, in February and March, we experienced normal weather trends across the country. April, however, was a little cooler and a little wetter than normal. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the summer months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, hot or cold, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was down roughly 8.5%, while our ticket was up 4%. Our transaction count decline was correlated to last year's Q3 meaningful 16% traffic count increase. While we had expected a decline in transactions this quarter, we were pleased to exceed our beginning of the quarter assumptions on transaction count declines. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We are very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Most of the sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers. I have visited our stores and commercial customers extensively this quarter and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our comprehensive offerings. The tone of our sales calls has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. As we start our final quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the summer months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 54 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and Midwest performing lower. As the Northeast and Midwest were cooler and wetter in April, their sales were below last year's results. We do not believe there will be lasting effects on sales performance in the Northeast and Midwest due to the slightly cooler April weather. Heading into the fourth quarter, we continue to believe weather will have a minimal effect on summer sales. Now, let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 2.6% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $593 million and our EPS was $29.03 a share, increasing 9.6%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed our sales floor categories, but there was less than a 1% difference between them. As gas prices jumped recently, our sales results in certain hard parts categories performed below our plan. This is unlike the sales floor categories, which were on plan. We have been especially pleased with our growth rates in many of our categories like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year and easily exceeded our planned assumptions for the quarter. We believe our hard parts business will strengthen as our customers return to driving more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 7.8% from inflation, in line with the cost of goods inflation, which was up similarly at 7.2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers for the fourth quarter could be slightly higher than this past quarter's increases. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower ultimate cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to mid-term sales. What I have previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a 2-year stacked comp basis and a 3-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long-term. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to make sure the listeners know what our key business priorities are for the remainder of the fiscal year and give some color on those. First, we are focusing on our supply chain. We have two initiatives in place to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We believe intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn continued to drive our sales performance. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced opening two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduced drive times to stores and markets serviced by the new DCs, but they, being larger than the previous DCs, will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. We previously relied on our vendor community to carry these SKUs and shipped them once ordered by our stores. Our DC strategy is focused on carrying more product in our supply chain that was not available previously. These SKUs will smartly expand our stocked inventory across all 50 states. And lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico business, while accelerating growth in Brazil and we are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. We had very solid results so far in fiscal \u201822, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service, and this is what we will continue to define our success well into the future. And looking to the future, it is still very difficult to predict the next 6 to 12 months. But our perspective has meaningfully morphed over the last two quarters. On last quarter's call, we discussed how most, if not all, of the growth in sales we experienced since the start of the pandemic was sustainable. We believed our competitive positioning was materially improved, as indicated by our significant retail share gains and rapidly accelerated commercial sales growth. We believe customer behavior may have permanently changed. We continue to believe all of this today. If this holds true, it will be the 4th time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have been through significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique and it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we have now lapped the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we have all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and took several months. For Q4, in light of the amazing performance in the back half of 2020, the 2-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to studying 3-year comps to gauge our fourth quarter performance. That said, soon, we look forward to returning to focusing solely on 1 year comparisons. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas, they want to get out and drive, and we are here when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. We continue to believe we are better in stock than most retailers, and I think our results obviously support that belief. I'd like to share a few other points with you. It has been a rather noisy earnings season for retailers, and I want to be clear, crystal clear about our business and the environment. First, I believe AutoZone can manage effectively through this inflationary environment. Historically, our industry has been disciplined and rational about passing along cost increases with higher retails and that is true today. Second, we feel our store staffing levels are appropriate, and we can, and we will manage expenses appropriately for either stronger or weaker sales environment. Our business and our industry has been remarkably resilient and, frankly, robust. For the remainder of fiscal \u201822, we are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. Last quarter, we announced we would begin construction on three new distribution centers to fuel continued growth, two in the U.S. and one in Mexico. Expected to open in fiscal \u201824, these new distribution centers represent a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in DCs as during the pandemic, we've learned we need to have more excess capacity. Secondly, we are targeting to open 11 more new domestic mega hub in the U.S. in this quarter, Q4. These mega hubs will enhance our availability and support growth in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability, and our results show that they are working. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. Our fourth quarter will be a busy one from a store development standpoint. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Well, frankly, Bret, they are supporting smaller and smaller radius of geography today than they did before because we were getting so many of them. When we first built them, it was not uncommon for them to be supporting stores that were 2, 3, maybe even 400 miles away. A lot of times, that would be on an overnight basis. The real crux of it is, how do we get the stores that are in, call it, 30 or 40 miles away from the mega hub, and how can we get them service 3x a day. That's when we really performed well. But the biggest part of the mega hub performance is the mega hub itself. The four walls of the mega hubs are just continuing. Every time we look at them, and every time we open some and open more, they continue to outperform our expectations. And one of the remarkable things is they are not cannibalizing close-in stores like we thought they would. So as we talked on the last call, remember when we first launched the mega hubs, we said we would have 25 to 40. We're now in the 60s, and we're headed to 200. That just goes to show you the power of these mega hubs. Sure. Yes. We're hearing a lot of questions about what's going on with the low-end consumer, are people trading down? Our hard parts business, I don't want to overstate that. I mean, I think I said it was off about 1% during that. It is very difficult right now to get clarity on the comparisons. Let's remember \u2013 some people are talking about weather. We're saying we don't think weather was a meaningful impact on our business. What was meaningful was, we went up against stimulus from March of last year that lasted for 4 to 6 weeks. That is really the story. And so it's hard to say the low-end consumer, sure their purchases are down versus last year, of course they are. They had a massive amount of stimulus in their pocket. I think it will be interesting to see what happens over the fourth quarter. Are we watching what happens with the low-end consumer? Absolutely. But I also want to remind you the comment that I made at the end. If you think about the \u2013 over the last 30 years, there is been four significant shocks to the economy. In all four of those shocks, our performance and our industry's performance has made a meaningful step up during those shocks, recessions and pandemics that our business has gone up, and it's never stepped back down. Yes. Thank you, Bret. Yes. Just for clarity, there is pressure in both gross margin and SG&A. The majority of the diesel is in the warehouse and distribution costs, which is in gross profit. And then our \u2013 we have one of the largest light-duty fleets in our commercial and field management folks. And so there is a lot of pressure in SG&A as well. Both of them, both the light-duty and the heavy-duty. Thanks, Chris. I will say it crystal clear. No, we are not constraining our growth based upon the margin characteristics of the DIFM business. We set it for 1 million years. DIFM today operates at lower gross margins and lower operating margins. But it grows \u2013 it operates in operating margins the way we look at it on generally an incremental basis in the mid-teens. We will grow that business as fast as humanly possible. If we could add another $4 billion in sales and the corresponding operating income that comes with that tomorrow, with the limited amount of incremental capital that we have to deploy, we would do it tomorrow. We were very focused on operating profit dollars. And as we look forward, I would just encourage you all to look at our business from a gross margin point of view, how are we doing in DIY and how are we doing in commercial. Our goals will be to marginally increase those gross margins over time. If we do that and that puts \u2013 and the commercial business grows at 26% and it puts pressure on the overall gross margin, so be it. Yes. I don't know that I would say it can grow at a faster rate the industry itself. I clearly think that we can, and maybe some of our close-in competitors can grow faster in the commercial business because that is still so fragmented. But the bigger part of my point is this is the most remarkably resilient business I have ever seen. And I don't understand why, when we have a recession, our business goes up and we come out of it and our business never goes down. It seems to flat line and then grow from there. It's amazing to me. Yes. Thank you, Simeon. Yes. I think all of that makes perfect sense, Michael. I wish we had empirical evidence that could tell us that's exactly what's happened. I will tell you, if you asked me a year ago if we were going to retain the kind of sales gains that we had grown over the first 2 years of the pandemic, I would have said I doubt it. But there has also been other pressures that have happened. Clearly, the lack of new cars and the elevation of pricing, the radical elevation of pricing of used cars has our customers view on how long they are going to have that vehicle changing to much longer than it normally is. When that happens, they seem to take better care of their cars. I think we also didn't envision the inflation impact that we are seeing. And clearly, that's \u2013 I talked about some traffic declines, some significant traffic declines, 8.5% in the retail business. That was up against 16% traffic growth last year. I will take a 2-year comp of 7.5% traffic all day long, but inflation and the ability to pass that inflation on has helped us. That's another key element of this industry is the inelasticity of demand in this sector of retail is probably unparalleled. And so as this inflation has come through, it's helped us get through that period of time as well. The short answer is absolutely no. The longer answer is, we made very marginal price investments on the retail business. We have far lapped those probably six months or so ago. They were very targeted to specific highly-visible commodity-related items, and we are focused on our comparisons versus mass. That's in the past. About this time last year, in fact, we have now annualized it. We completed rolling out the pricing changes that we made in our commercial business. Again, I want to be crystal clear. The growth that we saw in commercial over the last couple of years is not a result of pricing investments alone. They are an element. There is many other elements, the mega-hubs and hubs, the Duralast brand. We have rolled out \u2013 we had the single largest technology investment in the company's history focused on commercial and commercial deliveries. Our delivery times are dropping. So, we have done a lot of different things, and we lowered our pricings to make sure that we were focused on pricing versus a different competitive set. All that together has worked and has worked really, really well. At this point in time, we do not have any additional pricing actions being tested nor being considered. We believe we are very happy with our prices today in retail and commercial except that we need to pass inflation costs along as they come in. We will be very focused on trying to keep the same kinds of competitive positioning, but we need to pass on the inflation as it comes through us in costs. Yes. Thank you, Mike. It's a very fair question. The information we have was, it was, as I have said, slightly cooler and slightly wetter. The real question \u2013 or the real discussion for this quarter was not weather it was stimulus. And I don't know how you fared out a 0.5 point or 1 point change in weather dynamics when you are talking about 2-year comps of 30% that were driven by stimulus. So, we are trying to focus on the major elements and make sure we communicate to you what we think are the real drivers, and frankly, the drivers that will help you understand our long-term trends. The weather was marginally different and I can't ferret it out in a 30% 2-year comp. I think you had two elements that happened. You had two elements that happened to miles driven. We are still rebounding from the pandemic decrease of miles driven. Now you have got the gas prices implications. What we have seen historically in the past, Mike, is when gas prices hit $4 a gallon, you can see a direct correlation with those prices and a decline in miles driven. What we said historically as we have seen people when it gets to those elevated levels, they change their behavior. They change where they live, they change where they work. Obviously, with remote work and those kind of things, there could be different nuances this time. A lot of people are saying, yes, but $4 a gallon back then would be the equivalent to $5 whatever today, that may be true. I don't know if that's the case or not. This has happened in pretty short order. And I think we need to watch what happens to miles driven over time. As we think about it, it will be a short-term phenomenon, just like it has been in the past. Our focus isn't about next quarter or even the quarter after that. And our focus, as I have said, is how do we think about driving this business to drive long-term cash flow at really high return rates and think out 3 years to 5 years. Gas prices will come and go, and it doesn't really impact how we manage the business day-to-day. Yes. Thank you. Yes. It's a really great question. I mentioned it in the call, and I have been out in the field a whole lot in the last three months. And the tone of the conversations with our commercial customers, be that national accounts at the senior leader level or in our commercial shops, has just \u2013 the tenor of the conversations have changed. It's a question of how can I give you more business versus the, age old things of, it was about availability, it was about the Duralast brand. The Duralast brand conversation has turned from a significant negative to a positive. And now, with our availability, it has meaningfully changed. So, I am not really hearing that we always can get better on delivery times. And if anybody wants to tell you why they are not giving you business, that's a very easy one. Well, now we have actual data that says, you are right, we are delivering to you too slow. Your average deliveries are 31 minutes and 37 seconds, and we apologize for that. We are going to work to get that better. And so we have got new tools at our disposal. We have got much better inventory assortments. The Duralast brand is amazing. And so the tenor of those conversations is really radically different than they were just 3 years or 4 years ago. Thank you. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY \u201822, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country's heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans, a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable third quarter last year, with 2.6% comp growth, a 2% decline in EBIT and a 9.6% increase in EPS. Our results for the first three quarters of the fiscal year have been incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.9 billion, up 5.9% and total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.8 billion, up 5.7%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 26% to over $1 billion and were up 70.4% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,600, up 23% as we averaged just over $87 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, growth at 26% exceeded our internal expectations and was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter represented the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better than expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 43 net new programs, finishing with 5,276 total programs. As I have said since the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY \u201822 and our results in the third quarter and year-to-date reflect this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategy and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little color on our progress here. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 67 Mega-Hub locations and we expect to open approximately 11 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,600 per program, the 67 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. This quarter, I visited one of our key markets where we are testing greater mega hub density. And although it's early innings, I am thrilled with the results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. This strategy is working and we are doubling down by raising our near-term mega hub target from approximately 110 to 200 mega hubs, supplemented by our new objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. Yes, we plan to have 500 total locations, with significantly higher levels of expanded parts availability and soon. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we are expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners are excited, our customers are excited and we are building a meaningful competitive advantage. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down 4.5%, but up 20.3% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained significant market share since the start of the pending. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 8.5% from last year's record traffic levels that were fueled by government stimulus. However, we also saw a 4% ticket growth as we continue to methodically raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen behind our growth initiatives in a favorable macro environment. On a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which are providing a strong tailwind for our business. Our in-stock positions, while still below historic norms, continue to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our DIY business remains strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we've had great execution by our teams. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 673 stores, and three new stores in Brazil, ending with 58. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 12% of our total store base now outside the U.S., and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 54 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where mix drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 4.8%, a welcome trade-off that is a net positive for our business. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.8% versus last year Q3 as SG&A, as a percentage of sales, deleveraged 114 basis points. The deleverage was driven by payroll as last year's historic DIY comp drove significant and more than appropriate leverage on SG&A, where we simply couldn't staff to the accelerated sales growth fast enough. We also continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends and user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $786 million, down 2.2% and versus the prior year's quarter, driven by last year's strong sales performance in DIY. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.9 million, down 7% from Q3 a year ago, although our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter was $6.1 million versus $5.3 billion in Q3 last year. We're planning interest in the $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $58.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 21.4% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 284 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 211 basis points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, down 0.6% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of $20.4 million was 9.3% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $29.03, up 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $843 million of operating cash flow and spent $161 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $682 million in free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, down 13% versus the prior year. The primary reason for the decline in free cash flow versus last year is the timing of merchandise inventories and payments this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward. We remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q3 last year. Total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation and our growth initiatives. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $216,000 versus negative $167,000 last year and negative $198,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 127.9% versus last year's Q3 of 123.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At quarter end, we had just under $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash flow we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We've bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q3 at 2.1x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDA. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target when appropriate. To wrap up, we had another very successful quarter. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Bill. Yes. On the first part of your question, I mean, there is no question, we're seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing higher transportation costs. We're seeing higher fuel costs. However, as we reiterated on the call, the industry pricing is rational, and we're actually pricing to recover all of those inflationary impacts, just as we've done in the past. So you've seen us move retail prices up. As inflation has moved up mid-single digits, our pricing has moved. I think our entire industry has done that. And as I've said before, inflation has been a little bit of our friend in terms of what we see in terms of retail pricing. Now as it relates to our commercial business, we want to be crystal clear. Our goal is to create a faster growing business with higher margin dollars. This is a much more sustainable way for us to grow our cash and, ultimately, shareholder value. Our domestic commercial business grew 26%. It's a mix headwind. We expect our domestic commercial business to continue to outgrow our DIY business, and that's a trade-off that we welcome. We will continue to run a very disciplined playbook on margin expansion opportunities across all of our business, which includes things that we're doing from a cost standpoint, raising our prices and managing our expenses accordingly. But we like the fact that we've got a commercial business with very strong operating margins that is accretive to the overall business. Yes. If you look at diesel in particular, it's up probably 50% versus a year ago. That does show up in our SG&A expenses. So as we're running the cost playbook and we're running our pricing playbook, we have to take all of those things into account. And as I said before, when we look at our business in total, and look at all of the inflationary impacts, we're pricing our retails accordingly to make sure that we maintain our margin structure going forward. That's right. Yes. A couple of things stand out to us. As we said, as we have tested greater density, we are seeing two dynamics. One is the business plan that we build usually justifies the mega-hub based on what happens inside the four walls. And so we are seeing those sales be largely incremental, as Bill mentioned. We are not seeing the cannibalization. What we have tested is as we put more mega-hubs into the market and jam more parts in the market, those satellite stores are benefiting tremendously because they are leveraging the inventory and the availability from those mega-hubs, and they are seeing an overall lift as well. We haven't talked specifically about what the quantification is. But I can tell you that it's significant, and it is what's given us confidence to take our target from 110 to 200. And quite honestly, we will likely go beyond that as we continue to test and learn more in the future. They do. But one of the things that we are experiencing right now, particularly with the growth in our commercial business, is that the ramp for the mega-hubs has been faster than what we have seen in the past. And that is because as we have put those additional parts into the marketplace, while we are doing all the work that Bill mentioned on our commercial acceleration initiatives, those mega-hubs are ramping up faster than we ever anticipated. I mean it will clearly be some pressure on SG&A, but what I will say is that we have been very disciplined about managing our SG&A expenses. And quite frankly, when we have to make these kind of investments, number one, they have great payoffs associated \u2013 paybacks associated with them. But number two, we look for bill payers elsewhere in the P&L to be able to go do that. But what we have done over time, and what we will continue to do is, we invest in a very disciplined way in growth, and we are not afraid to de-lever SG&A if we need to, to support that growth, because in the long-term, it's the right thing for our business. So, we have a plan over time to manage SG&A in line with our sales growth. But in the short-term, you may see us spike it up from time-to-time to support the investments in growth. And we have done that not only with the capacity investments that you talked about, we have done it with our IT expenses over time, and we will continue to do that going forward. Yes. I think two things you will see. Number one, we will continue to have mix pressure associated with our commercial business going forward. And we will be very transparent about what we see there. But all the playbook that we have historically run on managing gross margin, taking pricing actions in categories, driving down costs in certain categories, all those tactics will still be a play. And you will see us over time make positive improvements in gross margin. It's just that we are starting off in an environment where our commercial business is growing significantly faster than DIY, and that's going to be a margin pressure that we welcome because of the nature of the business and the fact that it's growing our overall gross profit dollars. So, we will be very transparent about it as we move forward, and it's a trade-off that we welcome. Well, it will depend on how fast the commercial business actually grows. If you look at the differential this quarter, it was significant, which actually drove gross margin deleverage this quarter. What I would say that if you were on an apples-to-apples basis in terms of growth rate, we would have actually seen gross margin be positive this quarter. But you have got the mix headwind there. It's a welcome trade-off and we are delivering. Well, I think you have got a dynamic here where, clearly, the macro environment associated with used cars is \u2013 has a significant impact on what you are seeing in the car park. The dynamic associated with new cars is similar. I mean our \u2013 if you look at the data on used cars, they are up 23% year-over-year, up 50% pre-pandemic. If you look at what's happening with dealer lots right now, they are probably carrying about a third of the inventory that they were pre-pandemic. So, it is a significant driver. What you are seeing though is that the car park is actually aging. People are hanging on to the vehicles longer. In fact the data that came out this morning shows that it's now ticked up to 12.2 years is the average age of a vehicle on the road. And those things are all producing a tailwind for us. I think what we are focused on as a business is, one, managing our business associated with the vehicles that are in operations, making sure that we have the assortment to go deal with that. And as there are changes in the car park, there are changes in technology, there are changes in consumer behavior, we just manage our business accordingly, and we have done that historically over time, and it's been a good outcome for us. We will continue to see our commercial business have very strong growth. And the initiatives that we have talked about, whether it's the things that we are doing with assortment, the things that we have done with technology, the things that we have done with pricing, all of those things are driving significant growth in our commercial business, and we expect that trend to continue for us."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 second quarter conference call.

Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very seriously, and I am extremely proud of how our team has continued to respond to COVID-19 and the recent Omicron variant. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has presented. This quarter, we will start the same way by saying thank you to our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service and helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Lastly, I'll touch on the subject of pricing in the industry. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.8% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 15.2%. Our team has once again executed an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the ongoing very challenging environment. In Q1 of this fiscal year, we reported 13.6% same-store sales on top of 2021's Q1 same-store sales of 12.3%. Impressively, very impressively, our team delivered accelerating two-year comps in our second quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 32%. Commercial set a second quarter record with $844 million in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $200 million more in sales this quarter than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we generated $3.8 billion in annualized commercial sales versus $2.9 billion just a year ago, up 30%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any second quarter at $13,500 versus $10,500 last year. On a two-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 46% in commercial. Domestic represented 25% of our total company sales, another record for us compared to 21. 9% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host and I want to emphasize, a host of key initiatives we've been working on for the last several years. We improved our satellite store inventory availability. We've had massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage. We're leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand. We have better technology to make us easier to do business with. We have significantly improved our delivery times. We've enhanced our sales force's effectiveness and we're living consistent with our pledge by being 'priced right' for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran at 8.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's 15.7%. As our DIY two-year stacked comp accelerated from the first quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on four consecutive quarters of more than 20% two-year comps in this more mature portion of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous three full points of share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly continued to build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us more conviction on the sustainability of these sales levels. Now, let's focus on sales cadence. Our same-store sales decreased sequentially from late November through January and then accelerated again in the few days of the quarter we had in February. The deceleration through January could be deceiving as last year's comp strengthened as the quarter progressed as a result of the federal stimulus distributed around the first of last calendar year. Given the dynamics in the past 20 months, we, like others who've benefited from the pandemic, believe it has been more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and were very stable. For Q2, our two-year comp was 29.1%, and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 29.6%, 28.9%, and 29.1%, respectively. Regarding weather, until February, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the northeastern US, while the remainder of the country experienced pretty normal winter trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the spring months, we believe we will see normal weather trends and therefore, weather is not planned to be a big story for this upcoming quarter or summer. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either cold or hot, drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was up slightly while our ticket was up 7.8%. This slight transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stimulus and enhanced unemployment. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the spring months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. But this quarter, we saw a mere 15 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As winter definitely came in late January in the Northeast and Midwest, we are expecting that gap will remain close. Also, the market share data suggests we continued to gain share in most of our markets. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 13.8% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $472 million and our EPS was $22.30 a share, increasing an impressive 49.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts grew slightly faster than our sales floor categories, but not material, say, maybe less than 1%. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by over 5% from inflation. While our cost of goods was up over 4% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be slightly higher in the third quarter as cost increases and many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, we typically do not see corresponding deflation. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that, the past 4-quarter sales have all been consistent on a two-year stacked comp basis and a three-year basis, and that goes for both our DIY and our commercial businesses. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains very favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022, we expect our sales performance to be led by the strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to address the subject of pricing. And if AutoZone's pricing disciplines or philosophies have changed from past practices. The short answer is a resounding no. While we initiated a retail pricing adjustment last year in Q1 and further adjusted some commercial pricing in quarters two through four, these moves were done to be price competitive but with other channels, not with our direct competitors. Specifically, in the retail business, we reduced our premiums to mass, particularly on highly visible commodity products. Regarding the more significant change in commercial, our prices have always, always been meaningfully higher than our WD competitors as our service level is superior. Our pricing changes over the last year or so have been too narrow. I emphasize narrow, but not eliminate that gap. We must make sure we receive a premium for our service advantage, but we narrowed that premium by roughly half. While this has created some consternation in the investment community, we think our results have shown that this was a prudent and productive decision. We continue to see our industry as very rational when it comes to pricing strategies. And I want to be clear, crystal clear. I don't want anyone to conclude that our growth in commercial is solely due to pricing. We launched a comprehensive new strategy about three years ago, with improvements in assortments, local market availability with Hubs and Mega-Hubs, our delivery times are dropping as we leverage new technologies that have been deployed. Our team's execution is enhanced. We've made ourselves easier to do business with and we've improved our pricing versus WDs. We stated last year, we didn't envision any additional pricing reductions beyond those deployed at the beginning of last year's Q4, and that remains our stance. Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with double-digit comp growth, a 30% growth in EBIT and a 49% growth in EPS. Our results for the first half of the fiscal year have been remarkably strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.3 billion, up 15.6%. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 32.1% to $844 million and were up 46.8% on a two-year stacked basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 28.6% as we averaged just over $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew at approximately 32% for the quarter. While the second quarter is seasonally our lowest selling quarter, our results for the quarter are exceptional and represent the highest volume second quarter in the history of the chain. I want to continue to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. We are making tremendous progress in growing share in this highly fragmented portion of the market by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 22 net new programs, finishing with 5,233 total programs. As I said at the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY 2022 and our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year reflects this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 64 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 14 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $13,500 per program, the 64 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a result, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we are testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. By leveraging sophisticated, predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. We're building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. On the retail side of our business, same-store sales for our domestic retail business was up 8.4% and up 24.1% on a two-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic up slightly to go along with 7.8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our growth initiatives are also leading to share gains as we improve the customer shopping experience, expand assortment, and leverage our Hub and Mega-Hub network. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing and aging car park, and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY. Our in-stock positions, while still below where we were pre-pandemic, are continuing to improve as have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. Now, there's no question that DIY comps get tougher in the back half of the year due to exceptionally strong back half performance in both FY 2020 and FY 2021. But we remain confident that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we have had great execution by our teams. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 669 stores and two new stores in Brazil to finish with 55. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in line with the growth rates we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With only just over 10% of our total store base now outside the US and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 59 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 14.5%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the first quarter where we were down 65 basis points versus the previous year. Our merchandising team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, resulting in slightly better performance than our initial expectations. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry's pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the third quarter to be down in the 50 bps range versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by mix headwinds from our fast-growing commercial business. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.5% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged 264 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong results and approximately $40 million or 137 basis points and prior year pandemic-related expenses. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth. We also continued to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed, and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $627 million, up 30.1% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.5 million, down 7.7% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion versus just over $5.5 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $45 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, roughly flat with Q3 last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.3% versus 20.6% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 401 basis points from stock options exercised last year -- exercised, while last year, it benefited 265 basis points. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $472 million, up 36.4% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 21.2 million was 9% lower than last year's second quarter. It's a combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.30, up 49.4% over the prior year's second quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $362 million of operating cash flow and spent $106 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $270 million of free cash flow, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we have generated $960 million in free cash, up 12.4% versus the prior year. You should expect us to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, through our share repurchase program and the prepayment of a bond due in April, we have exhausted our excess cash balance on the balance sheet, but rest assured our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 3.3% versus Q2 last year. Total inventory increased 6.2% over the same period last year, driven mainly by new stores and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $198,000 versus negative $93,000 last year and negative $207,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 126.8% versus last year's Q2 of 113%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we dropped below 20 million shares outstanding. As a point of emphasis, when we started our share repurchase program in 1998, we had 154 million shares outstanding. Now we have less than 20 million. At quarter end, we had just under $958 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to return to our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 36.4% increase in net income and a 49.4% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we are committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a very strong start, and we remain focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Our culture is based on exceptional service and that will continue to define our success. I want to step back for a minute and talk about the big picture. Throughout the pandemic, each of us has had a very difficult time forecasting the future in light of all the uncertainties: the disease, the variants, consumer and government responses, competitive dynamics and on and on. But we are now nearly two years into this pandemic. What has happened to our business over those two years due to the tremendous contributions of our AutoZoners is nothing short of phenomenal. On a trailing 12-month basis versus pre-pandemic, our sales volumes have increased by over a remarkable 30%, and our profitability expressed as EBIT has increased nearly 50%. Six to nine months ago, if you would have asked us, our expectation was that some of those incremental sales and profits would go back closer to historic norms. While it is still very difficult to predict the next six to 12 months, our perspective has morphed, as we are nearly a year past the last stimulus and nearly six months from the suspension of enhanced unemployment, we believe most, if not all, of this growth is sustainable. We believe our competitive positioning is improved, as indicated by our significant share gains in both retail and commercial. And consumer behaviors may have permanently changed. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, but it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we begin to lap the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we've all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and it took several months to recover. For Q3, the two-year stacked comp measurement holds reasonably well as we delivered basically flat overall comps in Q3 of 2020. However, that measure for our commercial business won't be as meaningful. And then in Q4, in light of the amazing performance in 2020, the two-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to three-year comps. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas want to get out and get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers, and together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. While our in-stock levels are improving and we expect that to continue, we also believe we are better in stock than most retailers. And our results, they support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We're focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. In fiscal 2024, we plan to open a new distribution center in California to fuel continued growth of our domestic business. We just recently announced a new distribution center in Virginia. And we're now planning an additional distribution center in Mexico to allow us to service a growing store base in that country. This is a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in distribution centers as during the pandemic, we have learned we need to have a bit more excess capacity in our supply chain. We're also targeting to open 14 more new domestic mega hubs in the US that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. As we've mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability. This strategy is expected to help us drive both commercial and retail sales for many, many years to come. We also will be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in Brazil. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and, in particular, our own growth prospects. We're being disciplined yet we're being aggressive. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we very much, very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We do ask that all Q&A participants please limit to two questions per person. Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nJamere Jackson: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Yes. On the Americas expansion, sort of thinking longer term, how do you see the potential size of Mexico and Brazil on a three to five or maybe even longer-term basis?\nBill Rhodes: Sure. So we haven't given specific numbers, Bret, but what we have said repeatedly is, in both the United States and Mexico, we believe we can continue to grow at the current kinds of levels for the foreseeable future. So in the U.S., that's 150, 170 stores, Mexico, it's 40 to 50 stores. We believe we can do that for the foreseeable future. So it's going to be much, much larger than it is today. As far as Brazil is concerned, we're just getting started. You all know, we've been down there for over nine years now, and we were very methodical and very thoughtful and careful about making sure that this model worked for us. Just about a year ago, we presented to our Board that we felt like Brazil was now at the stage where we're comfortable, the model works. We knew it worked for the customers. We are now comfortable it works for us financially, and we will be stemming out and growing much faster in Brazil. I believe, over the long term, Brazil will end up being larger than Mexico for AutoZone. But with 50-some-odd stores, it's a long way to go.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then I guess, you called out share gains, obviously, and it's quantified your DIY at 3 points. Could you give us any more color on the commercial side of the business? And within the share gains, have you seen any either any meaningful contribution, national versus independent recently?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, Bret, I wish I could. We just don't have -- in the DIY business, we have very specific data. We have POS data for all front-of-store items. So it's crystal clear and we are comfortable sharing that with you. And that's where we said, during the height of the pandemic, we gained over 3%, which was 10% growth in share. Never seen that before personally. And we suspect that we would give some of that back up as the economy reopened. We have not. In fact, we continued to grow marginal amounts of share on top of that, which we've been very, very pleased with. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have a tool that gives us the direct insight. But when we look at it at the rates that we're growing, I think 46% on a two-year basis, we are quite comfortable that we're growing share exponentially many times what the industry is growing, but we don't have specifics, and so we can't tell you this is how we're doing against this sector or that sector.\nBret Jordan: Do you have a feeling whether it's -- is national account, or up and down the street business stronger than the other, or are they both sort of comparable growth rates?\nBill Rhodes: They're very comparable growth rates right now. That changes over times during the depths of the pandemic. The nationals weren't growing as fast as the up and down the street. I think that's changed now. They're both growing at really high rates. I think Jamere even mentioned like 32% for both sectors during the quarter. So, we're really, really pleased. We've really developed some very nice relationships with our national account partners. And we have a specific program for our up and down the street that we call Pro Vantage, and both of those sectors are really, really doing well.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you, Bret. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. So, for your Do-It-For-Me customers, can you talk a bit about your historical price gap versus your peers as well as WDs and how that's been trending over the last couple of years? And as you think about the drivers of sales for national, regional, and local accounts, where do you think the biggest drivers of share is today across price, availability or simply the fact that you're now able to serve certain customers that you historically weren't able to serve?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, I'll start. I think that there's a misnomer by many that our pricing strategies are at the core of our growth. They are an element, not the element of our growth. What we did about four years ago is we embarked on a new strategy in commercial. And we looked at all elements of our offering. We changed the assortment methodology in every store in the United States. Every store has a different product assortment that leans further into the commercial business today than it did four years ago. We also said how are we going to get significant increase in local market availability? And we came up with this concept called a Mega-Hub store. We've now had over 60 Mega-Hubs. We've said publicly, we're going to go to at least 110. I think Jamere and I both feel like it's going to be closer to 200 than it will be 100, and maybe even more than that as we're testing -- one of the things about the Mega-Hubs, every time we measure them, they do better than our projections. Every single time. So, we've done these Mega-Hub improvements. We've taken our sales force, which was relatively immature and, frankly, brand new a decade ago. And as they mature and develop tenure, they're getting more professional, better at doing their sales techniques. We've deployed those single largest technology endeavor of the company's history in the commercial business. We've enhanced how we interact with our customers digitally. We've also rolled out handheld devices to all stores and all drivers so that when they're picking the products, we make sure we've got the right products. When we deliver the products, we can understand delivery times. We're driving our delivery times down about 15% so far and that's nowhere near our goal. So, we're improving our service on that front. The Duralast brand continues to be become stronger and stronger across the board and really excited about that. And then we've lowered our price gaps. We didn't -- we don't have the same level of transparency in the commercial business that we have in retail. Everybody can see everybody's retail prices every day. In the commercial business, we're going to have different pricing philosophies with certain of our national account customers and then up and down the street customers that penetrate this category are going to be priced different from somebody else. So, you don't have the level of transparency. We talked about it at length about a year ago that we were focused on making sure that our total value proposition, including price, was a strong value proposition versus a different set of competitors called the warehouse distributors. And we cut, as I said in the prepared remarks, our gap versus them. We've always been premium priced to them because our service offering is premium priced. Then we cut the gap after \u2013 about a year of testing, so we knew it worked. We cut the gap by about half. So call it 15% to 8%-ish, 8.5-ish kind of percent. And we've been extraordinarily pleased with how that has worked over time. Zach, did I answer all your questions? You had a few of them embedded in there.\nZach Fadem: No, no. So that was great. I just wanted to follow-up on just your expectations for industry growth as a whole in 2022. How are you thinking about DIY versus Do-It-For-Me in terms of volume versus price inflation? And I presume you still see room to build on the three points of market share that you've taken since the pandemic.\nJamere Jackson: So I would say a few things. One, if you look at our results specifically, there are really four dynamics. The first is, to a certain extent, inflation has been our friend. It's helped us drive higher pricing and the volumes are actually holding. If you look at where we've seen pricing grow, I mean, we're up mid-single digits in retails for the first half. And quite frankly, if we see that same level of inflation in the back half, which is reasonable, then you could expect us to take pricing up in a similar dynamic. The share gains we've talked about are driving our business. We're up nearly three points versus the pre-pandemic. We've hung on to those share gains and the growth initiatives that Bill talked about, both in DIY and commercial, are giving us a lot of confidence that we'll maintain those shares as we go forward. And then the last dynamic for us that we've talked at length about is this macro strength that we're seeing. It's -- you have an aging and growing car park. You have used car prices that are up, 60% versus pre pandemic. And you're seeing many new cars that are actually selling higher than the sticker prices. And if you look at the used car price dynamic just in general, I mean, those higher residual values are actually encouraging our customers to invest in maintaining their vehicles because they're comfortable that the value is actually holding. So when you mix all of those things together, it suggests that the industry as a whole is not going back to pre-pandemic sales levels. And while we won't be date certain about when you'll see comps move one direction or the other, what we'll say is that the fundamentals are strong. We don't expect to return to the levels that we saw prior to coming into the pandemic. So our growth dynamics and the industry backdrop gives us a lot of confidence about the future.\nZach Fadem: Appreciate that. Thanks for the time.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is live.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. Congratulations.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: I guess I have two questions. I'll kind of merge them together. I mean, so first off, Bill, in your opening comments, you talked about just the strength in the business. Is there anything -- as you look at the acceleration in sales from fiscal Q1 into fiscal Q2, is there anything specific to point to? I mean, is inflation, your ability to pass along those inflationary prices, so to say, a factor there? And then my second question is just on the gas price front. I mean, I know you're not -- AutoZone does not provide guidance, but what we are seeing here is gas prices are again climbing due to, I guess, issues in the United States and now probably more importantly, geopolitical issues. Do these higher gas prices concern you at all in terms of sales and the health of your consumer?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. So two great points, Brian. First of all, what changed versus Q1 and Q2, there's a lot of different things that changed. I think our -- we're going to hang our head a lot on our execution and our team's execution. But clearly, this inflation has a lagging effect and we had more inflation in our sales growth in Q2 than we did in Q1, not material but maybe a point or so. So that is an element of our acceleration, and we didn't accelerate that much. I think we accelerated two or three points on a two-year basis. Then as far as gas prices, as you know, you've followed this industry for a long, long time. Gas prices fluctuate and they fluctuated very significantly during my tenure here. What we've said historically is that there's not a ton of correlation between gas prices and our business until it hits a magic point. And historically, and I don't know what that magic point will be now because it's been a long time since we hit it, but historically, when it hit $4 a gallon, it seemed to impact miles driven. And you could almost see a direct correlation once it hit that $4 a gallon in miles driven. We don't know if that will hold true if it gets to $4 a gallon again. But for us, it goes up and it goes down. There's nothing we change in our business as a result of gas prices. So sometimes we're going to have industry tailwinds like we've had. Sometimes, we're going to have industry headwinds. We need to just manage this business through both environments and make sure that we optimize our performance based upon the macro environment.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. Congratulations again. Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nChristian Carlino: Hi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you just help us lay out some of the drivers of the inflation, whether that be product or supply chain costs and how you're thinking about that going ahead this year? I'm understanding you're not giving guidance. And do you expect it to be a potential lift to sales in the second half of calendar 2022?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. As we mentioned before, I mean, we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing higher transportation costs. We're seeing higher labor costs across the board. But I think the important point is that the industry pricing has remained rational, and we are pricing like our competitors to recover inflationary impacts, just as we've done in the past. And if you look at the history of this industry, it's been very disciplined about passing along inflation. And typically, what we see is that the demand doesn't fall off, just given the essential nature of the goods that we're providing. We've raised retail prices in line with inflation. As we mentioned, it's been mid-single digits. We expect that you could see similar dynamics in the back half of the year, and we'll be disciplined to raise prices accordingly. The other dynamics as it relates to this is that we're seeing broad-based inflation. It isn't just in our industry. But if you look at transportation, you look at labor, you look at wage rates, there's another side of the coin, which is our customers, are benefiting from higher wage rates and particularly that lower-end customer is benefiting from higher wage rates. And that, quite frankly, has provided a little bit of a safety net, probably more so than in the past. And we're filling that inflation even in our own business. If I think about what we're seeing in terms of wage inflation, it's probably -- on a percentage basis, it goes up maybe low single digits every year. We're probably seeing inflation 2x that, as we look to take care of our AutoZoners in an inflationary environment, our customers are seeing that. So those dynamics have made the lower-end consumer a little bit more resilient than probably they would have been in the past in an inflationary environment. So we're not seeing any wobbles at this point, but it is something that we're keeping our eye on.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. That's really helpful color. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, you're clearly doing a lot to leverage technology to improve fulfillment on the commercial side of the business. Could you speak to the opportunity to build out technology on the pricing front? Maybe sift through all data, are you able to -- do you have better pricing visibility across the commercial market than, say, some of your peers? How should we think about that opportunity?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. One of the things I'm really excited about is, the investments that we're making in technology. And you typically don't hear CFOs say that, because typically, they're only thinking about the cost side of that. But the investments that we're making in technology are really underpinning the growth strategy. And the sophisticated nature with which we're able to figure out what we're doing on the store development side, how we're using AI and machine learning to help us think about pricing and get a lot more surgical from a pricing standpoint are all things that I'm really excited about to help us drive growth and improvements in our business. So indeed, we are using technology to do that. It's a little bit more difficult, sometimes on the commercial side of the business. But you combine that technology with the on-the-ground intelligence that we're receiving from our AutoZoners in the field, and I like our capabilities there. And it's given us a competitive advantage as we think about what we're doing from a pricing standpoint.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. Thanks. Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nJackie Sussman: Hi. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question is just on product availability. Kind of how much of an advantage has been in the stock over the last two years, has been kind of in-stock and does it narrow as supply chains come back? Kind of what is your outlook there? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. It's a fantastic question, Jackie. And frankly, we don't have really, really good data on how our in-stock position compares to our direct competitors or with retail in general, except for walk-in stores, and which we've done a lot of over time. I'm really, really proud of the way that our supply chain team, our merchandising team and our suppliers, they've worked at unprecedented levels during this past couple of years. And we've gotten very creative. Our logistics team has done an amazing job with all the challenges getting merchandise from the Far East to the United States into our distribution centers. Our belief is, we've had an improved in-stock position versus others. But our in-stock position, even today is a couple of hundred basis points below where it is normally. And it's been a little bit of a game of whack-a-mole. We solve it in this category, then it moves into that category, then it moves into another category. Overall, we're getting better and better and better on a weekly basis, just about. But we still got a ways to go before we get back to that level. Trying to quantify how much of that has been embedded in our share gains and sales lift, it's just -- it's too much art for us to figure that out.\nJackie Sussman: Got you. Understood. And you talked a bit about the Duralast brand. Have you disclosed kind of Duralast penetration by product category? Which products are kind of over-indexed and which are under?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. We haven't done it by product category. We obviously said it's over half of our hard part sales and continues to grow. We continue to introduce it in different categories or line extensions. Not too long ago, we introduced the Duralast Elite brake pad program, which is doing really well. We've added Duralast Gold chassis, which has done extremely well. A couple of years ago, we added Duralast shocks and struts. It's interesting, we did some market research as part of our commercial strategy development about four years ago, and we went by in the commercial business. And we said, what are the top three brands by product category? And the Duralast brand was listed in two categories as the number two brand, and we had never sold one piece in that category. So it just shows you the overall power of the Duralast brand. And if you turn back the clock a decade, it was interesting. People would have said we couldn't have been successful in commercial because we had private label. We don't have private label. We've got the Duralast brand, and it's high-quality products that our customers continue to turn to and trust.\nJackie Sussman: Great. Congrats on a great quarter.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jackie.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Joe [ph] on for Scot. I just had a quick question. Given the success you guys have shown in the Mega-Hub strategy, do you think we could see an acceleration of these rollouts next year and going forward? And what does that look like for margins?\nBill Rhodes: Well, Jamere is in charge of store development so I'll answer it for him. The answer is yes. Jamere, you want to add some color?\nJamere Jackson: You're writing my development plan for this year and next year. Thanks. The key for us is making sure that we leverage these assets. As Bill mentioned, every time we've doubled down on our Mega-Hub strategy, it's paid dividends for us and the Mega-Hubs are outperforming our expectations. The ability to put these assets in the market, provide a lift to the overall network, benefit both our DIY and our DIFM business, there's a very strong business building proposition for us. And we're going to go further and faster. One of the things I mentioned we're testing is higher density of Mega-Hubs in a marketplace. You typically are worried about cannibalization if you get stores or assets too close from a proximity standpoint. But what we're finding is when we put more parts into those markets and we do that in a disciplined way based on the analysis that we're doing and the research that we've done and the actual results that we're seeing, it's exceeded our expectation. Cannibalization is lower. It's a lift to the overall marketplace, and that's why we're so bullish and that's why we're going to double down on it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Joe. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, and we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us as we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY 2022, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Thank you very much for participating in today's call. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very seriously, and I am extremely proud of how our team has continued to respond to COVID-19 and the recent Omicron variant. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has presented. This quarter, we will start the same way by saying thank you to our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service and helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Lastly, I'll touch on the subject of pricing in the industry. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.8% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 15.2%. Our team has once again executed an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the ongoing very challenging environment. In Q1 of this fiscal year, we reported 13.6% same-store sales on top of 2021's Q1 same-store sales of 12.3%. Impressively, very impressively, our team delivered accelerating two-year comps in our second quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 32%. Commercial set a second quarter record with $844 million in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $200 million more in sales this quarter than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we generated $3.8 billion in annualized commercial sales versus $2.9 billion just a year ago, up 30%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any second quarter at $13,500 versus $10,500 last year. On a two-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 46% in commercial. Domestic represented 25% of our total company sales, another record for us compared to 21. 9% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host and I want to emphasize, a host of key initiatives we've been working on for the last several years. We improved our satellite store inventory availability. We've had massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage. We're leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand. We have better technology to make us easier to do business with. We have significantly improved our delivery times. We've enhanced our sales force's effectiveness and we're living consistent with our pledge by being 'priced right' for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran at 8.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's 15.7%. As our DIY two-year stacked comp accelerated from the first quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on four consecutive quarters of more than 20% two-year comps in this more mature portion of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous three full points of share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly continued to build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us more conviction on the sustainability of these sales levels. Now, let's focus on sales cadence. Our same-store sales decreased sequentially from late November through January and then accelerated again in the few days of the quarter we had in February. The deceleration through January could be deceiving as last year's comp strengthened as the quarter progressed as a result of the federal stimulus distributed around the first of last calendar year. Given the dynamics in the past 20 months, we, like others who've benefited from the pandemic, believe it has been more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and were very stable. For Q2, our two-year comp was 29.1%, and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 29.6%, 28.9%, and 29.1%, respectively. Regarding weather, until February, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the northeastern US, while the remainder of the country experienced pretty normal winter trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the spring months, we believe we will see normal weather trends and therefore, weather is not planned to be a big story for this upcoming quarter or summer. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either cold or hot, drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was up slightly while our ticket was up 7.8%. This slight transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stimulus and enhanced unemployment. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the spring months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. But this quarter, we saw a mere 15 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As winter definitely came in late January in the Northeast and Midwest, we are expecting that gap will remain close. Also, the market share data suggests we continued to gain share in most of our markets. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 13.8% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $472 million and our EPS was $22.30 a share, increasing an impressive 49.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts grew slightly faster than our sales floor categories, but not material, say, maybe less than 1%. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by over 5% from inflation. While our cost of goods was up over 4% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be slightly higher in the third quarter as cost increases and many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, we typically do not see corresponding deflation. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that, the past 4-quarter sales have all been consistent on a two-year stacked comp basis and a three-year basis, and that goes for both our DIY and our commercial businesses. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains very favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022, we expect our sales performance to be led by the strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to address the subject of pricing. And if AutoZone's pricing disciplines or philosophies have changed from past practices. The short answer is a resounding no. While we initiated a retail pricing adjustment last year in Q1 and further adjusted some commercial pricing in quarters two through four, these moves were done to be price competitive but with other channels, not with our direct competitors. Specifically, in the retail business, we reduced our premiums to mass, particularly on highly visible commodity products. Regarding the more significant change in commercial, our prices have always, always been meaningfully higher than our WD competitors as our service level is superior. Our pricing changes over the last year or so have been too narrow. I emphasize narrow, but not eliminate that gap. We must make sure we receive a premium for our service advantage, but we narrowed that premium by roughly half. While this has created some consternation in the investment community, we think our results have shown that this was a prudent and productive decision. We continue to see our industry as very rational when it comes to pricing strategies. And I want to be clear, crystal clear. I don't want anyone to conclude that our growth in commercial is solely due to pricing. We launched a comprehensive new strategy about three years ago, with improvements in assortments, local market availability with Hubs and Mega-Hubs, our delivery times are dropping as we leverage new technologies that have been deployed. Our team's execution is enhanced. We've made ourselves easier to do business with and we've improved our pricing versus WDs. We stated last year, we didn't envision any additional pricing reductions beyond those deployed at the beginning of last year's Q4, and that remains our stance. Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a very strong start, and we remain focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Our culture is based on exceptional service and that will continue to define our success. I want to step back for a minute and talk about the big picture. Throughout the pandemic, each of us has had a very difficult time forecasting the future in light of all the uncertainties: the disease, the variants, consumer and government responses, competitive dynamics and on and on. But we are now nearly two years into this pandemic. What has happened to our business over those two years due to the tremendous contributions of our AutoZoners is nothing short of phenomenal. On a trailing 12-month basis versus pre-pandemic, our sales volumes have increased by over a remarkable 30%, and our profitability expressed as EBIT has increased nearly 50%. Six to nine months ago, if you would have asked us, our expectation was that some of those incremental sales and profits would go back closer to historic norms. While it is still very difficult to predict the next six to 12 months, our perspective has morphed, as we are nearly a year past the last stimulus and nearly six months from the suspension of enhanced unemployment, we believe most, if not all, of this growth is sustainable. We believe our competitive positioning is improved, as indicated by our significant share gains in both retail and commercial. And consumer behaviors may have permanently changed. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, but it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we begin to lap the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we've all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and it took several months to recover. For Q3, the two-year stacked comp measurement holds reasonably well as we delivered basically flat overall comps in Q3 of 2020. However, that measure for our commercial business won't be as meaningful. And then in Q4, in light of the amazing performance in 2020, the two-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to three-year comps. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas want to get out and get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers, and together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. While our in-stock levels are improving and we expect that to continue, we also believe we are better in stock than most retailers. And our results, they support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We're focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. In fiscal 2024, we plan to open a new distribution center in California to fuel continued growth of our domestic business. We just recently announced a new distribution center in Virginia. And we're now planning an additional distribution center in Mexico to allow us to service a growing store base in that country. This is a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in distribution centers as during the pandemic, we have learned we need to have a bit more excess capacity in our supply chain. We're also targeting to open 14 more new domestic mega hubs in the US that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. As we've mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability. This strategy is expected to help us drive both commercial and retail sales for many, many years to come. We also will be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in Brazil. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and, in particular, our own growth prospects. We're being disciplined yet we're being aggressive. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we very much, very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Sure. So we haven't given specific numbers, Bret, but what we have said repeatedly is, in both the United States and Mexico, we believe we can continue to grow at the current kinds of levels for the foreseeable future. So in the U.S., that's 150, 170 stores, Mexico, it's 40 to 50 stores. We believe we can do that for the foreseeable future. So it's going to be much, much larger than it is today. As far as Brazil is concerned, we're just getting started. You all know, we've been down there for over nine years now, and we were very methodical and very thoughtful and careful about making sure that this model worked for us. Just about a year ago, we presented to our Board that we felt like Brazil was now at the stage where we're comfortable, the model works. We knew it worked for the customers. We are now comfortable it works for us financially, and we will be stemming out and growing much faster in Brazil. I believe, over the long term, Brazil will end up being larger than Mexico for AutoZone. But with 50-some-odd stores, it's a long way to go. Yes, Bret, I wish I could. We just don't have -- in the DIY business, we have very specific data. We have POS data for all front-of-store items. So it's crystal clear and we are comfortable sharing that with you. And that's where we said, during the height of the pandemic, we gained over 3%, which was 10% growth in share. Never seen that before personally. And we suspect that we would give some of that back up as the economy reopened. We have not. In fact, we continued to grow marginal amounts of share on top of that, which we've been very, very pleased with. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have a tool that gives us the direct insight. But when we look at it at the rates that we're growing, I think 46% on a two-year basis, we are quite comfortable that we're growing share exponentially many times what the industry is growing, but we don't have specifics, and so we can't tell you this is how we're doing against this sector or that sector. They're very comparable growth rates right now. That changes over times during the depths of the pandemic. The nationals weren't growing as fast as the up and down the street. I think that's changed now. They're both growing at really high rates. I think Jamere even mentioned like 32% for both sectors during the quarter. So, we're really, really pleased. We've really developed some very nice relationships with our national account partners. And we have a specific program for our up and down the street that we call Pro Vantage, and both of those sectors are really, really doing well. Yes, thank you, Bret. Have a good day. Yes, I'll start. I think that there's a misnomer by many that our pricing strategies are at the core of our growth. They are an element, not the element of our growth. What we did about four years ago is we embarked on a new strategy in commercial. And we looked at all elements of our offering. We changed the assortment methodology in every store in the United States. Every store has a different product assortment that leans further into the commercial business today than it did four years ago. We also said how are we going to get significant increase in local market availability? And we came up with this concept called a Mega-Hub store. We've now had over 60 Mega-Hubs. We've said publicly, we're going to go to at least 110. I think Jamere and I both feel like it's going to be closer to 200 than it will be 100, and maybe even more than that as we're testing -- one of the things about the Mega-Hubs, every time we measure them, they do better than our projections. Every single time. So, we've done these Mega-Hub improvements. We've taken our sales force, which was relatively immature and, frankly, brand new a decade ago. And as they mature and develop tenure, they're getting more professional, better at doing their sales techniques. We've deployed those single largest technology endeavor of the company's history in the commercial business. We've enhanced how we interact with our customers digitally. We've also rolled out handheld devices to all stores and all drivers so that when they're picking the products, we make sure we've got the right products. When we deliver the products, we can understand delivery times. We're driving our delivery times down about 15% so far and that's nowhere near our goal. So, we're improving our service on that front. The Duralast brand continues to be become stronger and stronger across the board and really excited about that. And then we've lowered our price gaps. We didn't -- we don't have the same level of transparency in the commercial business that we have in retail. Everybody can see everybody's retail prices every day. In the commercial business, we're going to have different pricing philosophies with certain of our national account customers and then up and down the street customers that penetrate this category are going to be priced different from somebody else. So, you don't have the level of transparency. We talked about it at length about a year ago that we were focused on making sure that our total value proposition, including price, was a strong value proposition versus a different set of competitors called the warehouse distributors. And we cut, as I said in the prepared remarks, our gap versus them. We've always been premium priced to them because our service offering is premium priced. Then we cut the gap after \u2013 about a year of testing, so we knew it worked. We cut the gap by about half. So call it 15% to 8%-ish, 8.5-ish kind of percent. And we've been extraordinarily pleased with how that has worked over time. Zach, did I answer all your questions? You had a few of them embedded in there. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So two great points, Brian. First of all, what changed versus Q1 and Q2, there's a lot of different things that changed. I think our -- we're going to hang our head a lot on our execution and our team's execution. But clearly, this inflation has a lagging effect and we had more inflation in our sales growth in Q2 than we did in Q1, not material but maybe a point or so. So that is an element of our acceleration, and we didn't accelerate that much. I think we accelerated two or three points on a two-year basis. Then as far as gas prices, as you know, you've followed this industry for a long, long time. Gas prices fluctuate and they fluctuated very significantly during my tenure here. What we've said historically is that there's not a ton of correlation between gas prices and our business until it hits a magic point. And historically, and I don't know what that magic point will be now because it's been a long time since we hit it, but historically, when it hit $4 a gallon, it seemed to impact miles driven. And you could almost see a direct correlation once it hit that $4 a gallon in miles driven. We don't know if that will hold true if it gets to $4 a gallon again. But for us, it goes up and it goes down. There's nothing we change in our business as a result of gas prices. So sometimes we're going to have industry tailwinds like we've had. Sometimes, we're going to have industry headwinds. We need to just manage this business through both environments and make sure that we optimize our performance based upon the macro environment. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. It's a fantastic question, Jackie. And frankly, we don't have really, really good data on how our in-stock position compares to our direct competitors or with retail in general, except for walk-in stores, and which we've done a lot of over time. I'm really, really proud of the way that our supply chain team, our merchandising team and our suppliers, they've worked at unprecedented levels during this past couple of years. And we've gotten very creative. Our logistics team has done an amazing job with all the challenges getting merchandise from the Far East to the United States into our distribution centers. Our belief is, we've had an improved in-stock position versus others. But our in-stock position, even today is a couple of hundred basis points below where it is normally. And it's been a little bit of a game of whack-a-mole. We solve it in this category, then it moves into that category, then it moves into another category. Overall, we're getting better and better and better on a weekly basis, just about. But we still got a ways to go before we get back to that level. Trying to quantify how much of that has been embedded in our share gains and sales lift, it's just -- it's too much art for us to figure that out. Yes. We haven't done it by product category. We obviously said it's over half of our hard part sales and continues to grow. We continue to introduce it in different categories or line extensions. Not too long ago, we introduced the Duralast Elite brake pad program, which is doing really well. We've added Duralast Gold chassis, which has done extremely well. A couple of years ago, we added Duralast shocks and struts. It's interesting, we did some market research as part of our commercial strategy development about four years ago, and we went by in the commercial business. And we said, what are the top three brands by product category? And the Duralast brand was listed in two categories as the number two brand, and we had never sold one piece in that category. So it just shows you the overall power of the Duralast brand. And if you turn back the clock a decade, it was interesting. People would have said we couldn't have been successful in commercial because we had private label. We don't have private label. We've got the Duralast brand, and it's high-quality products that our customers continue to turn to and trust. Thank you, Jackie. Well, Jamere is in charge of store development so I'll answer it for him. The answer is yes. Jamere, you want to add some color? Thank you, Joe. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, and we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us as we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY 2022, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Thank you very much for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with double-digit comp growth, a 30% growth in EBIT and a 49% growth in EPS. Our results for the first half of the fiscal year have been remarkably strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.3 billion, up 15.6%. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 32.1% to $844 million and were up 46.8% on a two-year stacked basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 28.6% as we averaged just over $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew at approximately 32% for the quarter. While the second quarter is seasonally our lowest selling quarter, our results for the quarter are exceptional and represent the highest volume second quarter in the history of the chain. I want to continue to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. We are making tremendous progress in growing share in this highly fragmented portion of the market by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 22 net new programs, finishing with 5,233 total programs. As I said at the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY 2022 and our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year reflects this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 64 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 14 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $13,500 per program, the 64 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a result, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we are testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. By leveraging sophisticated, predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. We're building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. On the retail side of our business, same-store sales for our domestic retail business was up 8.4% and up 24.1% on a two-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic up slightly to go along with 7.8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our growth initiatives are also leading to share gains as we improve the customer shopping experience, expand assortment, and leverage our Hub and Mega-Hub network. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing and aging car park, and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY. Our in-stock positions, while still below where we were pre-pandemic, are continuing to improve as have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. Now, there's no question that DIY comps get tougher in the back half of the year due to exceptionally strong back half performance in both FY 2020 and FY 2021. But we remain confident that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we have had great execution by our teams. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 669 stores and two new stores in Brazil to finish with 55. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in line with the growth rates we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With only just over 10% of our total store base now outside the US and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 59 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 14.5%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the first quarter where we were down 65 basis points versus the previous year. Our merchandising team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, resulting in slightly better performance than our initial expectations. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry's pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the third quarter to be down in the 50 bps range versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by mix headwinds from our fast-growing commercial business. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.5% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged 264 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong results and approximately $40 million or 137 basis points and prior year pandemic-related expenses. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth. We also continued to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed, and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $627 million, up 30.1% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.5 million, down 7.7% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion versus just over $5.5 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $45 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, roughly flat with Q3 last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.3% versus 20.6% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 401 basis points from stock options exercised last year -- exercised, while last year, it benefited 265 basis points. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $472 million, up 36.4% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 21.2 million was 9% lower than last year's second quarter. It's a combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.30, up 49.4% over the prior year's second quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $362 million of operating cash flow and spent $106 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $270 million of free cash flow, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we have generated $960 million in free cash, up 12.4% versus the prior year. You should expect us to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, through our share repurchase program and the prepayment of a bond due in April, we have exhausted our excess cash balance on the balance sheet, but rest assured our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 3.3% versus Q2 last year. Total inventory increased 6.2% over the same period last year, driven mainly by new stores and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $198,000 versus negative $93,000 last year and negative $207,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 126.8% versus last year's Q2 of 113%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we dropped below 20 million shares outstanding. As a point of emphasis, when we started our share repurchase program in 1998, we had 154 million shares outstanding. Now we have less than 20 million. At quarter end, we had just under $958 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to return to our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 36.4% increase in net income and a 49.4% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we are committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill. Good morning, Bret. So I would say a few things. One, if you look at our results specifically, there are really four dynamics. The first is, to a certain extent, inflation has been our friend. It's helped us drive higher pricing and the volumes are actually holding. If you look at where we've seen pricing grow, I mean, we're up mid-single digits in retails for the first half. And quite frankly, if we see that same level of inflation in the back half, which is reasonable, then you could expect us to take pricing up in a similar dynamic. The share gains we've talked about are driving our business. We're up nearly three points versus the pre-pandemic. We've hung on to those share gains and the growth initiatives that Bill talked about, both in DIY and commercial, are giving us a lot of confidence that we'll maintain those shares as we go forward. And then the last dynamic for us that we've talked at length about is this macro strength that we're seeing. It's -- you have an aging and growing car park. You have used car prices that are up, 60% versus pre pandemic. And you're seeing many new cars that are actually selling higher than the sticker prices. And if you look at the used car price dynamic just in general, I mean, those higher residual values are actually encouraging our customers to invest in maintaining their vehicles because they're comfortable that the value is actually holding. So when you mix all of those things together, it suggests that the industry as a whole is not going back to pre-pandemic sales levels. And while we won't be date certain about when you'll see comps move one direction or the other, what we'll say is that the fundamentals are strong. We don't expect to return to the levels that we saw prior to coming into the pandemic. So our growth dynamics and the industry backdrop gives us a lot of confidence about the future. Thanks, Brian. Yes. As we mentioned before, I mean, we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing higher transportation costs. We're seeing higher labor costs across the board. But I think the important point is that the industry pricing has remained rational, and we are pricing like our competitors to recover inflationary impacts, just as we've done in the past. And if you look at the history of this industry, it's been very disciplined about passing along inflation. And typically, what we see is that the demand doesn't fall off, just given the essential nature of the goods that we're providing. We've raised retail prices in line with inflation. As we mentioned, it's been mid-single digits. We expect that you could see similar dynamics in the back half of the year, and we'll be disciplined to raise prices accordingly. The other dynamics as it relates to this is that we're seeing broad-based inflation. It isn't just in our industry. But if you look at transportation, you look at labor, you look at wage rates, there's another side of the coin, which is our customers, are benefiting from higher wage rates and particularly that lower-end customer is benefiting from higher wage rates. And that, quite frankly, has provided a little bit of a safety net, probably more so than in the past. And we're filling that inflation even in our own business. If I think about what we're seeing in terms of wage inflation, it's probably -- on a percentage basis, it goes up maybe low single digits every year. We're probably seeing inflation 2x that, as we look to take care of our AutoZoners in an inflationary environment, our customers are seeing that. So those dynamics have made the lower-end consumer a little bit more resilient than probably they would have been in the past in an inflationary environment. So we're not seeing any wobbles at this point, but it is something that we're keeping our eye on. Yes. One of the things I'm really excited about is, the investments that we're making in technology. And you typically don't hear CFOs say that, because typically, they're only thinking about the cost side of that. But the investments that we're making in technology are really underpinning the growth strategy. And the sophisticated nature with which we're able to figure out what we're doing on the store development side, how we're using AI and machine learning to help us think about pricing and get a lot more surgical from a pricing standpoint are all things that I'm really excited about to help us drive growth and improvements in our business. So indeed, we are using technology to do that. It's a little bit more difficult, sometimes on the commercial side of the business. But you combine that technology with the on-the-ground intelligence that we're receiving from our AutoZoners in the field, and I like our capabilities there. And it's given us a competitive advantage as we think about what we're doing from a pricing standpoint. Thank you. You're writing my development plan for this year and next year. Thanks. The key for us is making sure that we leverage these assets. As Bill mentioned, every time we've doubled down on our Mega-Hub strategy, it's paid dividends for us and the Mega-Hubs are outperforming our expectations. The ability to put these assets in the market, provide a lift to the overall network, benefit both our DIY and our DIFM business, there's a very strong business building proposition for us. And we're going to go further and faster. One of the things I mentioned we're testing is higher density of Mega-Hubs in a marketplace. You typically are worried about cannibalization if you get stores or assets too close from a proximity standpoint. But what we're finding is when we put more parts into those markets and we do that in a disciplined way based on the analysis that we're doing and the research that we've done and the actual results that we're seeing, it's exceeded our expectation. Cannibalization is lower. It's a lift to the overall marketplace, and that's why we're so bullish and that's why we're going to double down on it."

Sir, the floor is yours.\nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for Autozone\u2019s 2022 first quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I am very proud of how our team has responded. Since the start of the pandemic, we've reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing WOW customer service regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way. As part of saying thank you to our AutoZoners this past quarter, the company committed $9 million to the AutoZoner Assistance Fund. The Assistance Fund is an independent non-profit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place. We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way. To me, it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values. We can't thank our team of roughly 105,000 AutoZoners enough for all they do for our customers, each other, our communities, and ultimately our shareholders. This morning we will review our overall same store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retail, and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Okay, on to our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter on top of last year's very strong 12.3%. Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and deliver amazing results. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%. Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales. I was reflecting on that this morning and remembering back to the day that we cracked $1 billion in commercial sales for a full year. And now we've delivered 900 million in sales in one quarter, an incredible accomplishment. On a trailing four quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year. On a two year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%. Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial. In short, it is not one thing, and I want to repeat that it is not one thing. It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years. Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub, coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our Salesforce effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%. Wow. While our DIY two year stat comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% two year comp in this sector of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long term. Now let's focus on our sales cadence. Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November. However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed. Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we like others who've benefited from the pandemic believe it is more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable. For Q1, our two year comp was 25.8% and the four week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26.0%, and 25.3% respectively. Regarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the north-eastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter. As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter. Historically, extreme weather be that hot or cold helps drive parts failure. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth and retail, our traffic was up 1% while our ticket was up 7.5%. This low-single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year as expected due to the elimination of stimulus to reduce the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay at home orders, and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months. During the quarter, there were some key geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, while last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap and comp performance between the northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country. We did not see that gap this quarter. In fact, the northeast and Midwestern markets slightly outperformed. The market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter, our net income was $555 million, and our EPS was $25.69 a share increasing an impressive 38.1%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates and select failure related businesses like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation. While our cost of goods was up about 2%, on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. We could see mid-single digit inflation and retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry, our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past three quarter sales have all been consistent on a two year stat comp basis. And both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains. Currently, the macro environment while more uncertain than normal, is certainly favorable for our industry. And if these near term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022 our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Now I like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, our growth initiatives continued to deliver strong results. And the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 16.2%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million, and were up 41% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The discipline investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have a commercial program and approximately 86% of our domestic stores and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we open 32 net new programs finishing with 5211 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. As I said on last quarters call, in fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way and our first quarter results reflect this dynamics. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share, we are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double digit sales growth for the past six quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum and we're doubling down. We now have 62 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses. And we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers, and improving our product availability and delivery times. These assets continue to outperform our expectation, and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted. In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a two year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained to maintain over three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and shared growth along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers. These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing. These dynamics along with favorable macro trends and miles driven, a growing car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY and the execution of our AutoZoners were taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage. I'm also very pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlet going forward. Our in-stock positions while still below where we would like for them to be are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints, and have product available to meet our customer\u2019s needs. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and one new store in Brazil to finish with 53. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continued expansion in a discipline way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to Autozone\u2019s future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investments in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year where we were down at two basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter. All of the actions we have taken have resulted in us growing our DIY, and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a discipline way. We're laser focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone, and over time, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 171 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times. We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% last year's first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 134 basis points. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption of credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of $21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69 up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter. Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred was up a 10th percent versus Q1 last year. Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year driven by new stores. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was the negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year and negative $203,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash. The powerful free cash we generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter. We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to maintain our long term leverage target in the two and a half times area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS. We're driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and on-going value to our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a stellar start. And we continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. That in our culture is what defines us. From July 4 1979, when our first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas, customer service has been paramount to our success. At the end of the day, it is why customers come back to us whether they are a seasoned professional or a new DIY. They trust us. They trust us to help them with their needs. We continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on our own opportunities for the New Year. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the foreseeable future. Our customers across the Americas want to get out, get out and drive. And we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers. While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in stock levels, we believe we are better than most real retailers. And I think our results support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We are focused on further growing share, but as always doing so on a very profitable basis. We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will also be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet aggressive. Before we move to open up the call for questions, I want to take a moment, a moment to give special thanks to Mark Finestone, our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation, customer satisfaction on his upcoming retirement in early calendar 2022. Our company, our customers, our leadership team, and in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service. Mark spent the majority of his years with AutoZone leading our merchandising team, and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years. He leaves our organization much, much better than he found it and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth. We thank Mark for his amazing service and leadership with the company. And we wish he and his wife Cindy well in their well-deserved retirement. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we, we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Your line is live. You may begin.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nWilliam Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Hey, on the commercial comp, it really seems like the super hubs are a tailwind? Do you have any color as to how the comps are for stores that are serviced by a super hub versus those that are not and maybe the benefit we might get as you roll out more super hubs?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes Bret, it's really hard to tease that out, and I\u2019ve spent considerable time in our prepared remarks talking about it. I think a lot of people think that this success that we're seeing in commercial is either driven by the mega hubs or driven by pricing. And frankly, that's not what we believe. We talked about it about four years ago that we were launching a new strategic plan or developing a new strategic plan for our commercial business, and it has a whole host of elements, mega hubs is a critical part of it. But don't forget, we also refreshed the assortments in every single AutoZone store in the United States and put those assortments commercial leaning forward. But the mega hubs are helping us a tremendous amount, but so is the Duralast brand, so is our sales floor, so is our engagement of our store managers and district managers. We see the mega hubs in and of themselves perform exceptionally well. They continue to exceed our expectations. And as we've said, we're going to go to 100 to 110. Like we've also said that Jamere and the senior leadership team believe once we're finished, we'll be closer to 200 mega hubs than we will be 100 mega hubs. But that's a vision at this point in time, not a plan.\nBret Jordan: Okay, and then my follow up, I guess you talked about share gain, and that your in-stocks were better than most. Do you have any feeling for where you're retaining your share, I guess against smaller WDs against the big box or sort of your major aftermarket peers? Do you have a feeling sort of buckets of where your share gain came from and where you're holding it best?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, I think it's a tale of two stories. Right on the DIY side of the business. Clearly, there were some significant share gains that happened in the depths of the pandemic and the stay at home orders where we did pick up a lot of share from mass retailers. We anticipated that we would have a pretty good headwind starting in last August, but But that simply hasn't manifested itself, and I think what's happened is customers that were coming to us before experienced us during the midst of this crisis and really enjoyed their experience, our team did a great job. So I think it's still coming from those more mass oriented and the retail side of the business. On the commercial side of the business, we believe it's likely coming from the smaller players, you mentioned, WDs. But I think over time, what happened was a lot of people, when the sales went down in our industry by about 25%, overnight, a lot of people in our industry pulled back considerably. Some people furloughed people, they laid off people, they took their order -- inventory orders down significantly, we certainly took some actions. We never furloughed one person. We never terminated one person because of the pandemic. In fact, we gave them two extra weeks of vacation, we called it emergency time off. And so when all of a sudden the business rebounded very quickly, we were in a terrific place. And I think that gave us trial in the commercial business with a lot of folks that we might not have gotten trial as quick as we did otherwise. And when we were there for those customers, I think that they appreciated the whole host of offerings that we had. And we've continued to grow since then, mean that to be up 40% on a two-year basis is really astounding, and to be up 29% in this quarter alone, I just couldn't be more pleased of what our team has done and we believe this is just the beginning. We've talked about the importance of the commercial business for a long time. And we're still the fourth in market share and that's not where we want to be, and I'm excited about what's in front of us.\nBret Jordan: Right, thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thank you Bret.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. You may begin.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning everyone. Not sure if Mark\u2019s in the room, but congratulations to him. My first question Bill is on the demand environment. There was a lot of buzz, positive buzz at Apex this year probably more than it's ever been. I'm curious if you share the optimism, is there anything unique about this moment whether it's used cars, why the demand environment could be above average for the foreseeable future?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, thank you for your shout out to Mark, Simeon. He's been just a tremendous partner to all of us for all these years. And, and I think about the AutoZone that Mark inherited versus the AutoZone that that he leaves to the rest of us, and it's a very different place and he played an enormous role in that as did so many others. But thank you for that. You know, I share your thoughts, Simeon, at Apex, there was a different vibe than probably we've ever seen before. I was kind of hoping everybody would be down and out because I knew how our sales were performing and I hoped we were doing very different than everyone else. I think it's just a great reminder of the strength of this industry. If you think about this industry over a very long period of time, I just celebrated my 27th anniversary with AutoZone, seen a lot of different cycles. One of the things that has happened, the strongest performing periods in our 30, last 30 years have been \u201893, \u201894, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811. That is before the pandemic. The pandemic has blown away those performance. In each one of those environments, you've seen AutoZone\u2019s performance maybe more than the industry but the industry also make a step function change up significant growth in the midst of a recession. What has been remarkable is in each of those times, you've never seen the industry or our sales, take a step back down, not even partially back down towards it. It's as if we reached a new plateau. And we just stayed there until we built again. I think my expectation with the pandemic and the amount of sales that we saw, particularly in the retail business, from the depths of the stay at home orders and all those things was, we would see somewhat a reversion to the mean, and here we sit today, it's December, the last stimulus happened in March 15. The enhanced unemployment ended at the end of August 1 or September. And we would have thought we would have seen some deceleration which we have not seen -- our business on both sides of the business, a 9% comp in DIY is remarkable. And so we'll be interested to see how long it holds at this level. I wish we had a crystal ball and could tell you, but I know that this organization is focused on how do we optimize our performance in the midst of whatever sales environment we have? How do we make sure we're taking care of customers? How do we make sure that we're keeping AutoZoners and customers safe? And how do we make the P&L work and maximize our performance? And I think we've done a really good job of that. And I'm very proud of the organization so far.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thanks for that. And then my follow up, I\u2019m not sure if it's for you, or Jamere. On the gross margin side if commercial, comps and DIY coms end up growing at a similar amount, and I realized that that may not happen, but if they do, what happens to gross margin? We're trying to isolate, I guess the mix shift and maybe the invest -- you know, how much investment is happening in the business?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, so if you think about gross margins, first of all, I'll say this, we've been seeing cost inflation in certain categories and higher transportation costs. However, the industry pricing has been rational, and we're pricing to recover inflationary impacts, as we've done in the past. And as Bill mentioned, from a retail pricing standpoint, where we've raised retails in sort of mid-single digit range, the industry has been disciplined and rational. And quite frankly, inflation has been our friend in terms of retail pricing. But I will remind you, as you highlighted here is that our commercial business will be a mixed drag. And right now we're significantly outpacing DIY growth on the commercial side of the business. And so that's been a margin drag. In fact, all of the margin drag in this quarter can be attributed to that acceleration that we have in our commercial business. So going forward, it will be a drag on the business and, but that will be good for us as a business because we'll see our gross profit dollars growing which is exactly what we're what we're shooting for. So we like where we are, we're going to continue to lean into the strategy. You'll see a little bit of a drag from a margin standpoint, from commercial mix, but net net it will be good for our business in total.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays.\nWilliam Rhodes: Hey you too, Simeon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Lasser at UBS. Your line is live. You may begin.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill you mentioned at this point in the cycle the perception was that the DIY business was going to be comping negative as you pointed out it comes up 9% in the quarter, with a little less than half of it likely coming from price increases to why has it not slowed otherwise? The perception early in the pandemic was that the marginal or incremental customer was that more affluent consumer who was working from home had more time on their hands, is doing some work on their car. As a result, is that still the incremental customer? Or has it evolved? Even some of the underlying dynamics like fewer new car sales similar to the other factors?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, it\u2019s a fantastic question. Michael, I wish I could tell you with certainty, it was built by x, y, and z. Let me just share some of our thoughts. But our thoughts are evolving. And we don't have clear insights into the strength of it, which we're [Indiscernible] to have, but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive, slightly positive in the retail business. Normally, because of changes in technology, and the improvement of quality of parts, we've typically had, three, three and a half percent deceleration in in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year, we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have, let's say on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit. Let\u2019s call it 4% or so on top of that. So that is a significant element. When we believe, what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic, was we had a lot of what I call our financially fragile customers. Those lower socio economic customers that had two things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed, and they had money, because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated as those two things ended in March 15 of 21 and early September 21, on enhanced unemployment, that we would see it slow down. I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years as people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right versus thinking they're going to get a new car in six months, so don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and use car prices being up I think the last time I saw it, something like 38% I think people in particular are more challenged economically, customers are thinking I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it. And I think that also, all levels of consumer appear to still be very, very healthy financially, versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years, any period where there's a tax refund or something, we see a big spike in our business stimulus, we saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business, it's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long, your guess is as good as mine.\nMichael Lasser: My guess isn't that good? So I'm sure you're a little bit better. But my follow on hasn't\u2026\nWilliam Rhodes: Mine hasn\u2019t been very good, either.\nMichael Lasser: My follow up question is on one of the key debates on your investment case right now is what is the algorithm look like? Moving forward historically, AutoZone\u2019s algorithm has been monitoring store growth, 2% to 4%, comp, stable margins and healthy share repurchases to deliver double digit EPS growth. Jamere made the point that you're building a faster growing business. So does the algorithm change moving forward, especially if commercial sustains its recent increases in puts pressure on your gross margin? Would you be willing to accept a formula over the long run where you have a slightly higher same store sales growth? Even if that meant about the same gross profit dollar growth that you've had historically cause it comes with gross margin pressure over the longer run? And as part of that I think Jamere mentioned that cost inflation is 2%. Price increases were 4%. You saw gross margin benefit this quarter from that spread? Doesn't that reverse in the quarters ahead? Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, three very complex questions. I think the answers are yes, yes and yes. Let me start and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well. Yes, we've had a long term algorithm that says you know how do we grow store count that 2% to 3%? How do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times, and maybe faster in these recessionary environments? How do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to share to do share repurchases that push us in and around double digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time? You remember, Michael, we had, I think, 41 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. So that's still long term generally, the model that we believe. However, we've had the most incredible six straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is, I would have thought we would have experienced that. By now, I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growths over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought six and 12 months ago. But once so we may have a slowdown at some point. But I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any. You asked would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages? And I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate, while we make sure we get great returns, and I think any organization's running a roughly a 40% ROIC, we've proven that we know how to how to leverage our capital structure. Jamere, anything that you would say differently, or do you want to address his last point?\nJamere Jackson: No, I think a couple things stand out to me. And Bill answered your question. I think very clearly, our goal has always been to grow our gross profit dollars. We have the luxury of having in this environment, a faster growing business with higher margin dollars overall. And I would argue this as a more sustainable way to grow cash and ultimately shareholder value. What doesn't change in the about the algorithm is the most important part of the algorithm, which is, this is a business that is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash that enables us to grow our business and return a significant amount of cash to shareholders over time. So as we've gone through this, this period, and we see an opportunity to accelerate the growth in our commercial business, by creating a faster growing business overall, it's ultimately meaning that we're a more profitable company on a $1 basis, and that's going to lead to more cash. And we're going to grow the business and return a significant chunk of that to shareholders. So long term, what I've been saying is that, while the geography changes a little bit, the algorithm at the bottom line doesn't change. This is a business that generates a ton of cash, and has tremendous firepower to grow and return cash to shareholders.\nMichael Lasser: Anything to add about the timing between price increases and cost increases?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, so from the standpoint of price increases, and cost increases, we've been very disciplined about making sure that when we see cost increases coming, we've taken retail pricing, sometimes we will take those in anticipation of those cost increases, there's a there's usually a catch up over time. But what I will say to you is that this is a pretty dynamic market, and that there are always pricing opportunities and cost increases that are that are coming our way. Our teams have done a tremendous job of managing this mix such that, we've historically found ways to have margin accretion when we go through this environment. And the most important part of that is that this is an industry that has been disciplined and rational and we expect this to continue. So we don't expect, ultimately for the cost increases, to be a margin drag over the business. We've done. We've done a fantastic job of managing that dynamic in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much. Best of luck and have a good holiday season.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo. Your line is live. You may begin.\nZachary Fadem: Good morning, guys. First I want to follow up on Michael's last question. If you look at your business over the last three to four years, your commercial mix has shifted from roughly 20% of your sales mix to now closer to 25%. While your EBIT margins have expanded by about 100 basis points during this time. So the question is as your business continues to evolve and you start to think about 30% or 35% commercial mix, how does this impact your EBIT margins? And to what extent should we view that 19%, 20% level as sustainable with or without the change in mix?\nJamere Jackson: Well, I think a couple dynamics are associated with that. Number one, the commercial business naturally will be a margin drag for us just based on the nature of the business. But you've got to remember we have a large DIY business, that we are continuing to drive efficiencies and margin expansion in that DIY business over time, such that there isn't a cliff associated with margins over time. So what you can expect from us is that we'll continue to push, to drive margin expansion in our in our business, overall, commercial will be a drag, but we'll continue to work on things from a productivity standpoint, and naturally, you may, you may see some of that impact our EBIT margins. But from a total EBIT dollar standpoint, we'll be in pretty good shape. And it will be a great story. And again, I always come back to this notion that from an earnings standpoint, from a cash standpoint, the most important part of this algorithm is that we're going to have tremendous firepower to grow the business and return a bunch of cash to shareholders.\nWilliam Rhodes: Let me jump in on that, too, Zach. I think when you look at what's happened over the last three or four years, to margins, you need to make sure that we don't lose sight of what happened to our DIY business over the last two years. Our same store sales and DIY are up 20% on a two year basis. We are getting a ton of leverage because of that outside sales group, our hope, and my hope is that we maintain all of it, or certainly a significant amount of it, we that's yet to be seen. But that changed the economics of the operating margin in the DIY business. Our focus, whether it's 19%, or 20%, is to is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return. And sometimes our margin, our operating margin might go down, because I've said for many times, if we could double our commercial business, at a substantially lower operating margin. Tomorrow, we would do it, because it doesn't require a lot of capital, and it would grow our operating profit dollars tremendously.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. That's helpful. And on the DIY side, obviously a lot of noise out there on the state of the lower income consumer as we move further and further away from stimulus. And considering the uptick and gas prices, food CPI and just overall broad based inflation and could your business. Could you talk about what you're seeing out there as it doesn't seem to be impacting your business at all? Curious how you think about the disconnect there?\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, I\u2019ll first start with you have to remember that our business is generally an inelastic business. Except for some reason, whenever the low end consumer has excess cash, we see a significant pop in our business. But I'll go back to what I said earlier, we historically haven't seen it revert back to the norms. The look at our business in the quarter, our retail business, our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10%, during the depths of the crisis, and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that, I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not. And then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation, and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time. The bigger question is the one that you're bringing up. If we continue to see significant inflation across the market, does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low end consumer? And ultimately, do we see a deceleration as a result of that? And I think that's a logical thesis. But we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition.\nJamere Jackson: Yes, I would just add that, that that piece of the thesis, if you will, we're a long way from that being the case, and if you just look at the things that Bill talked about three things, one, share growth, inflation being our friend, and this favorable macro environment. That's what gives us a lot of confidence here in the near term about our business. And we're continuing to perform very well in this environment against that backdrop.\nZachary Fadem: Thanks so much, guys. Happy holidays. Congrats to Mark.\nWilliam Rhodes: Yes, thank you very much, Zack, Happy Holidays to you too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Your line is live. You may begin.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks Good morning guys. So Bill you talked to a lot about consistency of on the monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, on a two year stack basis. But also, historically, we've talked a lot about, the impact of the business on shifting tax refund timing, and different periods. If you held the stock into this next quarter, obviously, that's a really impressive number, but you will also run into the stimulus payments from January. So I guess, what are your thoughts there? Do you think you saw a lift last year on the DIY side of the business? And do you think that, that would cause that to your stock to break?\nWilliam Rhodes: It\u2019s a great question, Chris, and I'm very happy that Jamere has not allowed us to reverse our long term history of not giving guidance. I don't know the answer to it, right? Yes, we'll be going up against the stimulus payment around the first of the year. Yes, we're going to be something we've talked about a lot, historically, we'll be going up against a pretty significant weather event, towards the end of our quarter and beginning of the next quarter. For us, we're going to maximize our performance and optimize our performance in whatever sales environment we have. We don't have to change, if we thought we were going to be plus two or down 2% on a historical basis, we don't have to change how we operate. And if we left that stimulus, and we have a little bit of a headwind for four weeks, so be it. We're running this business for the long term. As I've said in the prepared remarks, the valuation needs to be placed on this company depends on how our investors and particularly our long term investors feel our cash flow is going to be three to five years from now. And that's the lens that we're looking at. If we go through a tough quarter, because our business is up 25%, from pre pandemic, so be it, we need to make sure that we're making the investments today that allow us to continue to have this amazing cash flow generation for the long term.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it? And then make sense. And then in terms of the investments that you're making this year, can you give us some expectations term of CapEx? And will this create will the investment cycle or investment program for this year create pressure in OpEx, like in terms of what one might say, an appropriate relationship between, say, top line growth versus SG&A dollar growth might how that could be impacted?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, I mean, we're able to do this within the framework of our long term financial model, if you will. We will have some accelerated CapEx this year to build out the initiatives that Bill talked about. But if you look at sort of where we are in terms of our cash generating capability, the amount of free cash flow that we\u2019ll generate this year, it certainly won't impact anything that we're doing from a capital allocation or our ability to return cash to shareholders. So this is sort of a multiyear investment cycle, if you will. We\u2019ve talked about the capacity investments that we're making in the supply chain. I've talked about things that we need to do from an IT standpoint. We've talked about the growth that we're going to do in our store base. And we're able to do that within the framework of our financial model, if you will, without making material changes to the P&L.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Your line is live. You may begin.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Congrats on another really incredible quarter. Nicely done.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks.\nWilliam Rhodes: Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I have, I think goes to the comments you were making Jamere in the prepared remarks. But with regard to supply chain, no, it sounds like what you're saying AutoZone continues to manage this manage the challenges quite well. The question I have is, as you look at the challenges out there, are you starting to see some of these bottlenecks that are safe subsiding? And do you see is there a path towards and obviously it\u2019s going to take some time. Is there is there a path towards the supply chain for you improving significantly?\nWilliam Rhodes: It's a great question, Brian. I think the answer is yes, but it's ever changing. And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. You talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers, our business is up 25% or more since the pre pandemic level. Our supply chain, our manufacturers and their supply chains nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. Our teams have done a really, really, really good job of managing through it. That said, we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time. And they'll go down a little bit and they'll come up a little bit, but we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis. To your point, are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future? And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do, we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects, we're playing a little bit of Whack a Mole. In the beginning, it was particular categories, sandpaper. Now it's tools and brake rotors. We also back in the summer time we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai, to the U.S. Now it's can we get them through the ports in the U.S. and our team's done, been really creative about getting the ships, but now also finding different ports across the country to go to. So we are seeing it get better. But we are nowhere out of the woods on stage saying that next month, we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year, which is always a difficult time in any supply chain. So it'll be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring, early summer, we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought, okay, this one is easing, there's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges.\nBrian Nagel: Now this is very, very helpful. Thank you. The second question I have, I guess you're kind of more strategic in nature as well. But we talked about just the sales growth. And the sales growth has been phenomenal. And you're looking at the stack comps have been extraordinarily resilient here, even as the economy has moved away from the pandemic, from stimulus, the benefits, the benefits of stimulus. So the question I have is, if you think about the business, to the extent that you start seeing signals that maybe this is even the sales growth is even more sustainable than you initially thought, Is there a point at which you would start to invest more aggressively or a back into the business? Are there even places you would want to put more money, more investment to work in the business or sector reinvest their sales gains?\nWilliam Rhodes: I think we already have Brian. I talked in my prepared remarks, we're going to make the most significant investments that we've seen in our supply chain. Because we've seen this this surge in volume. Now, I don't want to spook everybody. Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million, $150 million kind of range over last year. And it \u2013 but it will have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years. And as we've talked about as a team, think over the long term, we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point, when you've been through a surge in volume, like we've experienced over the last 20 months, that was probably a little pennywise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments. We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last four years, from inventory assortments to mega hubs and hubs, to investments in the Duralast brand, to investments in price, investments in technology, the single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it. But we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business. So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today, we're looking at, are there other places that we can invest? I also want to say, one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done at nearly at the same level is we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture, through things like emergency time off. The last time I've tallied up, what we'd invested from emergency time off vaccine incentives and those kinds of things. We were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again, today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this, if we're going to have values that we state, it's imperative that we live consistent with those values. And I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic.\nBrian Nagel: Very helpful. Congratulations again to all. Thank you.\nWilliam Rhodes: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Brian. So before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today. Thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. We thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, our growth initiatives continued to deliver strong results. And the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 16.2%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million, and were up 41% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The discipline investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have a commercial program and approximately 86% of our domestic stores and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we open 32 net new programs finishing with 5211 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. As I said on last quarters call, in fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way and our first quarter results reflect this dynamics. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share, we are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double digit sales growth for the past six quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum and we're doubling down. We now have 62 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses. And we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers, and improving our product availability and delivery times. These assets continue to outperform our expectation, and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted. In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a two year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained to maintain over three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and shared growth along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers. These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing. These dynamics along with favorable macro trends and miles driven, a growing car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY and the execution of our AutoZoners were taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage. I'm also very pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlet going forward. Our in-stock positions while still below where we would like for them to be are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints, and have product available to meet our customer's needs. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and one new store in Brazil to finish with 53. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continued expansion in a discipline way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to Autozone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investments in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year where we were down at two basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter. All of the actions we have taken have resulted in us growing our DIY, and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a discipline way. We're laser focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone, and over time, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 171 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times. We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year's quarter driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's second quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% last year's first quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 134 basis points. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption of credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of $21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69 up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter. Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred was up a 10th percent versus Q1 last year. Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year driven by new stores. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was the negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year and negative $203,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash. The powerful free cash we generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter. We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to maintain our long term leverage target in the two and a half times area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS. We're driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and on-going value to our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill. Yes, so if you think about gross margins, first of all, I'll say this, we've been seeing cost inflation in certain categories and higher transportation costs. However, the industry pricing has been rational, and we're pricing to recover inflationary impacts, as we've done in the past. And as Bill mentioned, from a retail pricing standpoint, where we've raised retails in sort of mid-single digit range, the industry has been disciplined and rational. And quite frankly, inflation has been our friend in terms of retail pricing. But I will remind you, as you highlighted here is that our commercial business will be a mixed drag. And right now we're significantly outpacing DIY growth on the commercial side of the business. And so that's been a margin drag. In fact, all of the margin drag in this quarter can be attributed to that acceleration that we have in our commercial business. So going forward, it will be a drag on the business and, but that will be good for us as a business because we'll see our gross profit dollars growing which is exactly what we're what we're shooting for. So we like where we are, we're going to continue to lean into the strategy. You'll see a little bit of a drag from a margin standpoint, from commercial mix, but net net it will be good for our business in total. No, I think a couple things stand out to me. And Bill answered your question. I think very clearly, our goal has always been to grow our gross profit dollars. We have the luxury of having in this environment, a faster growing business with higher margin dollars overall. And I would argue this as a more sustainable way to grow cash and ultimately shareholder value. What doesn't change in the about the algorithm is the most important part of the algorithm, which is, this is a business that is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash that enables us to grow our business and return a significant amount of cash to shareholders over time. So as we've gone through this, this period, and we see an opportunity to accelerate the growth in our commercial business, by creating a faster growing business overall, it's ultimately meaning that we're a more profitable company on a $1 basis, and that's going to lead to more cash. And we're going to grow the business and return a significant chunk of that to shareholders. So long term, what I've been saying is that, while the geography changes a little bit, the algorithm at the bottom line doesn't change. This is a business that generates a ton of cash, and has tremendous firepower to grow and return cash to shareholders. Yes, so from the standpoint of price increases, and cost increases, we've been very disciplined about making sure that when we see cost increases coming, we've taken retail pricing, sometimes we will take those in anticipation of those cost increases, there's a there's usually a catch up over time. But what I will say to you is that this is a pretty dynamic market, and that there are always pricing opportunities and cost increases that are that are coming our way. Our teams have done a tremendous job of managing this mix such that, we've historically found ways to have margin accretion when we go through this environment. And the most important part of that is that this is an industry that has been disciplined and rational and we expect this to continue. So we don't expect, ultimately for the cost increases, to be a margin drag over the business. We've done. We've done a fantastic job of managing that dynamic in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Thanks. Well, I think a couple dynamics are associated with that. Number one, the commercial business naturally will be a margin drag for us just based on the nature of the business. But you've got to remember we have a large DIY business, that we are continuing to drive efficiencies and margin expansion in that DIY business over time, such that there isn't a cliff associated with margins over time. So what you can expect from us is that we'll continue to push, to drive margin expansion in our in our business, overall, commercial will be a drag, but we'll continue to work on things from a productivity standpoint, and naturally, you may, you may see some of that impact our EBIT margins. But from a total EBIT dollar standpoint, we'll be in pretty good shape. And it will be a great story. And again, I always come back to this notion that from an earnings standpoint, from a cash standpoint, the most important part of this algorithm is that we're going to have tremendous firepower to grow the business and return a bunch of cash to shareholders. Yes, I would just add that, that that piece of the thesis, if you will, we're a long way from that being the case, and if you just look at the things that Bill talked about three things, one, share growth, inflation being our friend, and this favorable macro environment. That's what gives us a lot of confidence here in the near term about our business. And we're continuing to perform very well in this environment against that backdrop. Yes, I mean, we're able to do this within the framework of our long term financial model, if you will. We will have some accelerated CapEx this year to build out the initiatives that Bill talked about. But if you look at sort of where we are in terms of our cash generating capability, the amount of free cash flow that we'll generate this year, it certainly won't impact anything that we're doing from a capital allocation or our ability to return cash to shareholders. So this is sort of a multiyear investment cycle, if you will. We've talked about the capacity investments that we're making in the supply chain. I've talked about things that we need to do from an IT standpoint. We've talked about the growth that we're going to do in our store base. And we're able to do that within the framework of our financial model, if you will, without making material changes to the P&L. Thanks."

            "name": "William Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for Autozone's 2022 first quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I am very proud of how our team has responded. Since the start of the pandemic, we've reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing WOW customer service regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way. As part of saying thank you to our AutoZoners this past quarter, the company committed $9 million to the AutoZoner Assistance Fund. The Assistance Fund is an independent non-profit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place. We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way. To me, it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values. We can't thank our team of roughly 105,000 AutoZoners enough for all they do for our customers, each other, our communities, and ultimately our shareholders. This morning we will review our overall same store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retail, and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Okay, on to our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter on top of last year's very strong 12.3%. Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and deliver amazing results. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%. Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales. I was reflecting on that this morning and remembering back to the day that we cracked $1 billion in commercial sales for a full year. And now we've delivered 900 million in sales in one quarter, an incredible accomplishment. On a trailing four quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year. On a two year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%. Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial. In short, it is not one thing, and I want to repeat that it is not one thing. It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years. Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub, coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our Salesforce effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%. Wow. While our DIY two year stat comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% two year comp in this sector of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long term. Now let's focus on our sales cadence. Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November. However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed. Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we like others who've benefited from the pandemic believe it is more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable. For Q1, our two year comp was 25.8% and the four week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26.0%, and 25.3% respectively. Regarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the north-eastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter. As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter. Historically, extreme weather be that hot or cold helps drive parts failure. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth and retail, our traffic was up 1% while our ticket was up 7.5%. This low-single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year as expected due to the elimination of stimulus to reduce the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay at home orders, and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months. During the quarter, there were some key geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, while last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap and comp performance between the northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country. We did not see that gap this quarter. In fact, the northeast and Midwestern markets slightly outperformed. The market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter, our net income was $555 million, and our EPS was $25.69 a share increasing an impressive 38.1%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates and select failure related businesses like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation. While our cost of goods was up about 2%, on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. We could see mid-single digit inflation and retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry, our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past three quarter sales have all been consistent on a two year stat comp basis. And both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains. Currently, the macro environment while more uncertain than normal, is certainly favorable for our industry. And if these near term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022 our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Now I like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a stellar start. And we continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. That in our culture is what defines us. From July 4 1979, when our first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas, customer service has been paramount to our success. At the end of the day, it is why customers come back to us whether they are a seasoned professional or a new DIY. They trust us. They trust us to help them with their needs. We continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on our own opportunities for the New Year. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the foreseeable future. Our customers across the Americas want to get out, get out and drive. And we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers. While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in stock levels, we believe we are better than most real retailers. And I think our results support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We are focused on further growing share, but as always doing so on a very profitable basis. We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will also be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet aggressive. Before we move to open up the call for questions, I want to take a moment, a moment to give special thanks to Mark Finestone, our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation, customer satisfaction on his upcoming retirement in early calendar 2022. Our company, our customers, our leadership team, and in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service. Mark spent the majority of his years with AutoZone leading our merchandising team, and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years. He leaves our organization much, much better than he found it and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth. We thank Mark for his amazing service and leadership with the company. And we wish he and his wife Cindy well in their well-deserved retirement. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we, we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Yes Bret, it's really hard to tease that out, and I've spent considerable time in our prepared remarks talking about it. I think a lot of people think that this success that we're seeing in commercial is either driven by the mega hubs or driven by pricing. And frankly, that's not what we believe. We talked about it about four years ago that we were launching a new strategic plan or developing a new strategic plan for our commercial business, and it has a whole host of elements, mega hubs is a critical part of it. But don't forget, we also refreshed the assortments in every single AutoZone store in the United States and put those assortments commercial leaning forward. But the mega hubs are helping us a tremendous amount, but so is the Duralast brand, so is our sales floor, so is our engagement of our store managers and district managers. We see the mega hubs in and of themselves perform exceptionally well. They continue to exceed our expectations. And as we've said, we're going to go to 100 to 110. Like we've also said that Jamere and the senior leadership team believe once we're finished, we'll be closer to 200 mega hubs than we will be 100 mega hubs. But that's a vision at this point in time, not a plan. Yes, I think it's a tale of two stories. Right on the DIY side of the business. Clearly, there were some significant share gains that happened in the depths of the pandemic and the stay at home orders where we did pick up a lot of share from mass retailers. We anticipated that we would have a pretty good headwind starting in last August, but But that simply hasn't manifested itself, and I think what's happened is customers that were coming to us before experienced us during the midst of this crisis and really enjoyed their experience, our team did a great job. So I think it's still coming from those more mass oriented and the retail side of the business. On the commercial side of the business, we believe it's likely coming from the smaller players, you mentioned, WDs. But I think over time, what happened was a lot of people, when the sales went down in our industry by about 25%, overnight, a lot of people in our industry pulled back considerably. Some people furloughed people, they laid off people, they took their order -- inventory orders down significantly, we certainly took some actions. We never furloughed one person. We never terminated one person because of the pandemic. In fact, we gave them two extra weeks of vacation, we called it emergency time off. And so when all of a sudden the business rebounded very quickly, we were in a terrific place. And I think that gave us trial in the commercial business with a lot of folks that we might not have gotten trial as quick as we did otherwise. And when we were there for those customers, I think that they appreciated the whole host of offerings that we had. And we've continued to grow since then, mean that to be up 40% on a two-year basis is really astounding, and to be up 29% in this quarter alone, I just couldn't be more pleased of what our team has done and we believe this is just the beginning. We've talked about the importance of the commercial business for a long time. And we're still the fourth in market share and that's not where we want to be, and I'm excited about what's in front of us. Thank you Bret. Yes, thank you for your shout out to Mark, Simeon. He's been just a tremendous partner to all of us for all these years. And, and I think about the AutoZone that Mark inherited versus the AutoZone that that he leaves to the rest of us, and it's a very different place and he played an enormous role in that as did so many others. But thank you for that. You know, I share your thoughts, Simeon, at Apex, there was a different vibe than probably we've ever seen before. I was kind of hoping everybody would be down and out because I knew how our sales were performing and I hoped we were doing very different than everyone else. I think it's just a great reminder of the strength of this industry. If you think about this industry over a very long period of time, I just celebrated my 27th anniversary with AutoZone, seen a lot of different cycles. One of the things that has happened, the strongest performing periods in our 30, last 30 years have been \u201893, \u201894, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811. That is before the pandemic. The pandemic has blown away those performance. In each one of those environments, you've seen AutoZone's performance maybe more than the industry but the industry also make a step function change up significant growth in the midst of a recession. What has been remarkable is in each of those times, you've never seen the industry or our sales, take a step back down, not even partially back down towards it. It's as if we reached a new plateau. And we just stayed there until we built again. I think my expectation with the pandemic and the amount of sales that we saw, particularly in the retail business, from the depths of the stay at home orders and all those things was, we would see somewhat a reversion to the mean, and here we sit today, it's December, the last stimulus happened in March 15. The enhanced unemployment ended at the end of August 1 or September. And we would have thought we would have seen some deceleration which we have not seen -- our business on both sides of the business, a 9% comp in DIY is remarkable. And so we'll be interested to see how long it holds at this level. I wish we had a crystal ball and could tell you, but I know that this organization is focused on how do we optimize our performance in the midst of whatever sales environment we have? How do we make sure we're taking care of customers? How do we make sure that we're keeping AutoZoners and customers safe? And how do we make the P&L work and maximize our performance? And I think we've done a really good job of that. And I'm very proud of the organization so far. Hey you too, Simeon. Thank you. Yes, it's a fantastic question. Michael, I wish I could tell you with certainty, it was built by x, y, and z. Let me just share some of our thoughts. But our thoughts are evolving. And we don't have clear insights into the strength of it, which we're [Indiscernible] to have, but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive, slightly positive in the retail business. Normally, because of changes in technology, and the improvement of quality of parts, we've typically had, three, three and a half percent deceleration in in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year, we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have, let's say on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit. Let's call it 4% or so on top of that. So that is a significant element. When we believe, what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic, was we had a lot of what I call our financially fragile customers. Those lower socio economic customers that had two things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed, and they had money, because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated as those two things ended in March 15 of 21 and early September 21, on enhanced unemployment, that we would see it slow down. I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years as people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right versus thinking they're going to get a new car in six months, so don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and use car prices being up I think the last time I saw it, something like 38% I think people in particular are more challenged economically, customers are thinking I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it. And I think that also, all levels of consumer appear to still be very, very healthy financially, versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years, any period where there's a tax refund or something, we see a big spike in our business stimulus, we saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business, it's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long, your guess is as good as mine. Mine hasn't been very good, either. Yes, three very complex questions. I think the answers are yes, yes and yes. Let me start and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well. Yes, we've had a long term algorithm that says you know how do we grow store count that 2% to 3%? How do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times, and maybe faster in these recessionary environments? How do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to share to do share repurchases that push us in and around double digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time? You remember, Michael, we had, I think, 41 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. So that's still long term generally, the model that we believe. However, we've had the most incredible six straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is, I would have thought we would have experienced that. By now, I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growths over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought six and 12 months ago. But once so we may have a slowdown at some point. But I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any. You asked would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages? And I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate, while we make sure we get great returns, and I think any organization's running a roughly a 40% ROIC, we've proven that we know how to how to leverage our capital structure. Jamere, anything that you would say differently, or do you want to address his last point? Let me jump in on that, too, Zach. I think when you look at what's happened over the last three or four years, to margins, you need to make sure that we don't lose sight of what happened to our DIY business over the last two years. Our same store sales and DIY are up 20% on a two year basis. We are getting a ton of leverage because of that outside sales group, our hope, and my hope is that we maintain all of it, or certainly a significant amount of it, we that's yet to be seen. But that changed the economics of the operating margin in the DIY business. Our focus, whether it's 19%, or 20%, is to is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return. And sometimes our margin, our operating margin might go down, because I've said for many times, if we could double our commercial business, at a substantially lower operating margin. Tomorrow, we would do it, because it doesn't require a lot of capital, and it would grow our operating profit dollars tremendously. Yes, I'll first start with you have to remember that our business is generally an inelastic business. Except for some reason, whenever the low end consumer has excess cash, we see a significant pop in our business. But I'll go back to what I said earlier, we historically haven't seen it revert back to the norms. The look at our business in the quarter, our retail business, our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10%, during the depths of the crisis, and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that, I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not. And then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation, and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time. The bigger question is the one that you're bringing up. If we continue to see significant inflation across the market, does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low end consumer? And ultimately, do we see a deceleration as a result of that? And I think that's a logical thesis. But we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition. Yes, thank you very much, Zack, Happy Holidays to you too. It's a great question, Chris, and I'm very happy that Jamere has not allowed us to reverse our long term history of not giving guidance. I don't know the answer to it, right? Yes, we'll be going up against the stimulus payment around the first of the year. Yes, we're going to be something we've talked about a lot, historically, we'll be going up against a pretty significant weather event, towards the end of our quarter and beginning of the next quarter. For us, we're going to maximize our performance and optimize our performance in whatever sales environment we have. We don't have to change, if we thought we were going to be plus two or down 2% on a historical basis, we don't have to change how we operate. And if we left that stimulus, and we have a little bit of a headwind for four weeks, so be it. We're running this business for the long term. As I've said in the prepared remarks, the valuation needs to be placed on this company depends on how our investors and particularly our long term investors feel our cash flow is going to be three to five years from now. And that's the lens that we're looking at. If we go through a tough quarter, because our business is up 25%, from pre pandemic, so be it, we need to make sure that we're making the investments today that allow us to continue to have this amazing cash flow generation for the long term. Thanks, Brian. It's a great question, Brian. I think the answer is yes, but it's ever changing. And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. You talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers, our business is up 25% or more since the pre pandemic level. Our supply chain, our manufacturers and their supply chains nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. Our teams have done a really, really, really good job of managing through it. That said, we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time. And they'll go down a little bit and they'll come up a little bit, but we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis. To your point, are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future? And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do, we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects, we're playing a little bit of Whack a Mole. In the beginning, it was particular categories, sandpaper. Now it's tools and brake rotors. We also back in the summer time we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai, to the U.S. Now it's can we get them through the ports in the U.S. and our team's done, been really creative about getting the ships, but now also finding different ports across the country to go to. So we are seeing it get better. But we are nowhere out of the woods on stage saying that next month, we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year, which is always a difficult time in any supply chain. So it'll be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring, early summer, we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought, okay, this one is easing, there's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges. I think we already have Brian. I talked in my prepared remarks, we're going to make the most significant investments that we've seen in our supply chain. Because we've seen this this surge in volume. Now, I don't want to spook everybody. Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million, $150 million kind of range over last year. And it \u2013 but it will have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years. And as we've talked about as a team, think over the long term, we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point, when you've been through a surge in volume, like we've experienced over the last 20 months, that was probably a little pennywise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments. We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last four years, from inventory assortments to mega hubs and hubs, to investments in the Duralast brand, to investments in price, investments in technology, the single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it. But we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business. So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today, we're looking at, are there other places that we can invest? I also want to say, one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done at nearly at the same level is we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture, through things like emergency time off. The last time I've tallied up, what we'd invested from emergency time off vaccine incentives and those kinds of things. We were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again, today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this, if we're going to have values that we state, it's imperative that we live consistent with those values. And I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Brian. So before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today. Thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care"

With me today are Phil Danielle, our CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.  Regarding the fourth quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the investor relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their incredible contributions during fiscal 2023 that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states they continued putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 7.4% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 12.9%. It's important to remember that these results build on the phenomenal three year performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022.  Candidly, Phil, Jamere, Tom Newbern, and I felt at some point we would see our sales per store migrate closer to pre-pandemic levels. That hasn't happened. And at this stage, we do not expect it will. To put it in perspective, our domestic average weekly sales per store are 33% higher than in 2019, growing from $35,600 a week to $47,300 a week. This level of growth and sales also drove enormous growth in operating profit, where this year's $3.474 billion was 61% above 2019, when adjusted for the 2,019, 53 week. That is remarkable growth, especially for a 44-year old enterprise. We could not have achieved this success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization.  We have several updates for you this morning. First, I'm sure you've noticed the new table in our press release. We are now presenting our same store sales results for domestic, international and total company. We're also reporting our international same store sales, which includes both Mexico and Brazil, on both an actual and constant currency basis.  Why the change? The answer is International is becoming a larger and larger part of our business, and we are investing a sizable amount of our growth capital in those countries. As we evaluate important growth metrics, we think it is important to assess it in total. As we know this is a change we are committed to providing you with each component individually for at least five quarters, as our objective is to enhance your visibility.  Next, our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter compared to 1.9% last quarter, and about half of our fiscal 2023 growth of 3.1%. Our performance in retail was respectable and generally in line with our expectations. But as was well documented last quarter, our commercial sales performance in the second half of our fiscal year declined meaningfully and to us unacceptably. We ended with 3.9% growth in domestic commercial sales.  Our performance in both retail and commercial in the first half of the quarter was disappointing, but during this period we experienced very mild weather. As we reached the second half of the quarter, and temperatures escalated materially, so did our sales. Specifically for the first eight weeks of the quarter our retail comps were flat, but increased 3.4% in the second half. Commercial experienced a similar trajectory, ending particularly strong in the last four weeks of the quarter, up over 7%.  Regarding regional results, we saw a material performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. The total comp difference was well over 300 basis points and over 450 basis points for commercial. We attribute this to the lack of winter weather and snowfall in the latter part of last winter in that region. This has led to lower growth trends in undercar categories. Both those are things that \"happened to us, not what we did to enhance and improve our performance.\"  Last quarter, we highlighted that we were not executing at our peak levels. We have made many changes since then, and are pleased with the improvements in execution we are seeing. We aren't there yet. But we're on a really good path. We also recently completed another strategic review of our commercial business. We have validated our direction and have some exciting new enhancements that we will be testing over the next few quarters. We also made significant improvements in the information technology that we use to operate our commercial business, and we opened many more commercial programs, reaching 90% domestic penetration for the first time in our history.  Even more encouraging is how strong those new openings are starting and how many -- many weeks -- or they're just a few weeks old. Ultimately we will operate in a favorable and unfavorable macro and weather environment. We want to share our perspectives with you so you can understand our performance. But ultimately, it is our actions that will determine our long term success. And we're encouraged by the actions we're taking.  Finally, our strategy supporting our store operations and commercial teams includes several other key elements. Global new store growth, where we disappointingly didn't achieve our goals in FY23, more on that later; continued growth with our hubs and in particular, mega hubs, where we are nearing the halfway point of our ultimate goal of having 200 mega hubs and 300 hubs.  It's important to reinforce the continued, very strong performance of these stores, especially the mega hubs, and particularly in commercial; reconfiguring our global supply chain to efficiently process the enhanced sales we have achieved and expect to achieve over the next decade, while optimizing our processes for handling more direct import products from many countries, and more challenging slow turning parts assortments that are critical to our success; and finally continuing to lean in hard on technology improvements to make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable, efficient and effective.  I've given you the high level sound bites on the quarter's results. Now I'd like to introduce Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil?\nPhilip Daniele: Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. I'm honored to be participating in my first earnings release conference call.  I will start by reviewing our Q4 overall same store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, and merchandise categories that drove our performance as well as any regional disparities. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think inflation will impact our business in FY24.  Our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter, on top of last year's exceptionally strong 6.2% growth. I do want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago, our execution improved materially over the quarter. And that execution, which is a hallmark of our success will ultimately deliver better results as we move forward. Our domestic commercial business grew 3.9%. Despite lower than anticipated, we believe we grew share and set another fourth quarter record with $1.5 billion in sales.  For the full year, we generated nearly $4.6 billion up 8.7% from last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, which is identical to last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, material improvements and hub and mega hub coverage, in addition to aggressive growth in the number of those types of stores.  We continue to strengthen the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality products. And we continue to deliver technological enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently with improvements in delivery time and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q4, we opened 156 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them late in the quarter, which had minimal impact on sales, but positions us well for FY24 and beyond.  With these moves, we now have commercial in over 90% of our domestic stores. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for commercial sales growth in FY24 and beyond. We're also very proud of our performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's comp of 1.1%. Additionally for the year, we delivered 1.8% DIY on top of a 2.9% DIY comp last fiscal year, and 11.2% comp in FY21. These results are very solid considering the outsized growth we saw during the pandemic.  The fact that we continue to retain the vast majority of the share we built during the pandemic, and our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY24.  Now let's focus on the sales cadence. Over the quarter, which spanned 16 weeks, early May through the end of August, as Bill mentioned, our same store sales were flat over the first weeks, but increased to 3.4% over the last eight weeks. We were encouraged by the trends we saw as the quarter ended.  Regarding weather, in May and June we experienced cooler and wetter weather trends across the country which negatively impacted our sales trends. By July however, it became very hot across much of the country, and it remained very hot through August. The heat and the associated rebound in sales helped us partially overcome a relatively mild winter, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast, where weather sensitive hard part categories underperformed our expectation. We anticipate that the summer heat will give us some positive momentum as we head into fall. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either hot or cold drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance.  Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 0.8% while our ticket was up 2%. Our transaction count improved as the quarter went along, and in fact, turned positive over the last eight weeks of the quarter. However, the average ticket being up only 2% was the weakest quarterly increase we've seen since FY 2000, as we lapped significantly higher inflation a year ago, where the ticket was up 8%.  Regarding commercial trends, we continue to see traffic and ticket growth, but our commercial ticket growth, just like retail, has shown a marked deceleration compared to recent history as hyperinflation begins to abate. For perspective, our ticket growth was 11% in Q4 last year, versus roughly 2% this year. As expected, some of our commercial customers are experiencing trade down and lower car count as the consumer comes under economic pressure.  In order to continue to grow our comps in '24 we will have to continue to increase share of wallet with our customers. The share data we see continues to encourage us that we are gaining share in the industry despite the macro trends, but recently, not in line with our aspirations, which we intend to change. During the quarter there were some geographic regions that did perform differently than others as there always are. This quarter we saw a material 315 basis point difference between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and the Midwest performing lower.  As the Northeast in the Midwest experienced a very mild, mild winter, with below average snowfall, we've seen less weather sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Headed into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we are not anticipating that weather will have a significant impact on sales.  Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories outperformed our hard part categories. And our hard part business was essentially flat for the quarter. As I said previously, weather sensitive hard parts were clearly impacted by the milder winter weather, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast.  Let me also address inflation in pricing. This quarter, we saw low single-digit inflation and as a result, our ticket average was up roughly 2%. We believe inflation for the first quarter will be similar to the fourth quarter as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels and lapping high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.  Historically, as costs have increased the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry historically has not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost and we believe we have entered one of those periods. For the first quarter of 2024 we expect our DIY sales to be resilient and our commercial trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.  Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our supply chain. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive sales growth with speed to customer and expanded availability.  Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexican and Brazilian businesses. With 804 stores open internationally or 12% of our store base these businesses had impressive performance last fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Phil. And good morning everyone. As both Bill and Phil had previously discussed we had a solid fourth quarter, stacked on top of an impressive fourth quarter last year. 6.4% total company sales growth, 1.7% domestic comp, a 14.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.8% increase in EBIT, and a 14.7% increase in EPS. In addition, our results for the entire fiscal year were very strong as total sales grew 7.4% and EPS grew 12.9%.  We continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total sales were just under $5.7 billion, up 6.4%. For the year our total sales were $17.5 billion, up 7.4% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY19. Our sales are up an amazing 47% or nearly $5.6 billion since 2019.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives starting with our domestic commercial business. For the fourth quarter our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.9% to $1.5 billion and up 25.9% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales.  Our average weekly sales per program were approximately $16,700, down 1.8%. Now it's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was impacted materially by the late in quarter openings of approximately 120 new programs. While these openings depressed the point in time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. These openings are part of our efforts to open more stores with commercial in response to the tremendous opportunity to grow our market share.  Our commercial acceleration initiatives are delivering the expected results, as we grow share by winning new business, and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program and approximately 90% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 156 net new programs, finishing with 5,682 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY23, and we feel good about our prospects heading into the New Year.  For FY23, our commercial sales were $4.6 billion, up 8.7% versus last year, and up 37% from two years ago. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we expect to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. To support our commercial growth we now have 98 mega hub locations with 13 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 98 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. In fact, our commercial mega hub business grew twice as fast as our overall commercial business in Q4.  As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.  We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs in the near term. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited and we're determined to build on our strong momentum.  On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 1.4% for the quarter. For FY23 our DIY crop grew 1.8% and 4.7% on a two year stack basis. The business continues to be remarkably resilient as we've managed to deliver positive comp growth through the cycle. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down slightly and 2% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining traffic counts offset by low to mid-single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.  Importantly, our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwind have driven a positive comp. We're forecasting a consistent and resilient DIY business environment for FY24.  Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. As you may have noticed, we changed our disclosure on our international business, and we will continue to do so going forward. With 12% of our total store base outside of the U.S., the current revenue contribution and the growth prospects moving forward, we simply have to share more about international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 27 new stores in Mexico to finish with 740 stores, and 17 new stores in Brazil ending with 100.  Our same store sales grew 34.1% on a reported basis and 14.9% on a constant currency basis. We remain committed to Mexico and Brazil, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. By 2028, after a robust strategic review of the market and ultimate store comp potential, we revised our strategy and anticipate opening as many as 200 stores annually in these markets in a disciplined fashion, making this an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.  Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margin. For the quarter our gross margin was 52.7%, up 118 basis points, driven primarily by a non-cash $30 million LIFO. credit this quarter. For Q4 last year, we had a $15 million LIFO charge. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 37 basis point improvement in gross margin.  I will point out that we now have $59 million in LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect these to largely reverse over FY24. We're currently modeling $15 million in LIFO credits in Q1 as inflation continues to abate, and we turn our inventory. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $59 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve.  Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.6% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 34 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.  Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10.8% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year benefit. EBIT for FY23 was just under $3.5 billion up 6.2% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $108.7 million, up 70% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q4 and last year.  We're planning interest in the $88 million range for the first quarter of FY24 versus $57.7 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.4% and up from last year's fourth quarter of 22.1%. This quarter's rate benefited 22 basis points from stock options exercised while last year had benefited 70 basis points. For the first quarter of FY24 we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.  Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $865 million, up 6.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.6 million was 6.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $46.46, up 14.7% for the quarter. For FY23 net income was $2.5 million, up 4.1% and earnings per share was $132.36, up 12.9%.  Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash and $701 million in free cash flow. For the year we generated $2.1 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong. And our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was down 0.6% versus Q4 last year while total inventory increased 2.2% over the same period last year driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $201,000 versus negative $240,000 last year, and negative $215,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 124.9% versus last year's Q4 of 129.5%.  Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.  We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts to cash to shareholders. We finished Q4 2.3 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to our leverage objectives, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target in FY24.  To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share.  I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders driven by a high degree of confidence in our strategy, and our exceptional team of AutoZoners.  One last housekeeping point, I'd like to remind you that in FY24, we will have a 53rd week in our financial results. This extra week will be added to our Q4 results. As a result, our fiscal year will now end August 31, 2024. In order to model that extra week, I encourage you to look at our financial breakouts of both our fiscal 2019 and 2,013 fourth quarters, which were the last two years we had the extra week and we show breakouts of the full P&L accordingly.  And now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year, live the pledge. I know this sounds like a very consistent theme for AutoZone. In fact, it was the theme we used in my first full year as CEO in 2006.  I'm asked frequently, what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer goes back to the same point over and over, the culture. I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never emphasize the culture enough. The culture is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It's based on a team-based approach recognizing everyone's contributions and performance and putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity.  It's about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility. And it is so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategies succinctly. As we've accelerated our top line since the onset of the pandemic, our competitive positioning has also materially improved. Our efforts for 2024 will be focused on execution. We have a lot of projects in flight, and we did get them completed. Supply chain improvements will remain a key focus in FY24.  We will continue with our additions of mega hub and hub stores, new distribution centers and international store growth. As you noticed our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 14.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now.  This morning, I'm excited to share after an extensive strategic review of the ultimate number of locations we can have in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. We are announcing our plans for a much more aggressive global store development plan. Over the last five years we've averaged 140 domestic store openings and 50 international openings for a total of roughly 190 new stores a year in the Americas. We plan on accelerating this pace and aspire to open as many as 500 stores five years from now.  So by FY28 we are modeling 500 store openings with the split being 300 in the U.S., 200 internationally. FY24 we will remain around 200, but we will ramp from there. You may be asking why this change of strategy and why now? The answer is our profitability per store is materially higher since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to find new trade areas even in our more mature U.S. markets. Our growth in commercial has materially changed the economics on a per-store basis. We believe this is just the beginning on commercial, and our ROIC, one of the most important metrics we track is over 50%.  Also our international markets are immature. So we continue to see expansion opportunities in Mexico and Brazil, along with putting a toehold at some point in other new markets. I want to stress that we will be diligent and disciplined. We have a long track record of performance with high returns and strong cash flow generation. We have no plans on changing that strategy and approach, where we believe in evolution over revolution. We believe in continuous improvement and we believe in test and learn.  We have been, and remain anchored on our capital allocation strategy. While I spent time talking about our store development strategies for the future, that is not the key focus for us in FY24. The number one focus will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to sales growth. We're excited as we start 2020.  This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this year, $17.5 billion in sales, racing past the $17 billion milestone. DIY comps are 1.8%, most impressively 15.9% on a three year basis. Commercial sales are now $4.6 billion. I personally distinctly remember a goal of $1 billion not that long ago. Average weekly sales domestically of $47,600, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually.  Our Mexico and all data [ph] teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count, and getting to profitability breakeven on the path to substantial profitability in the future. We bought back 3.7 billion in AutoZone stock, the second highest ever, only behind last year's 4.4 billion. And our team has grown our EBIT by 61% in four years. That's remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels. And we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure.  As I've said on several occasions, we have to exit pandemic mode. We had to get back to taking care of the customer. And this requires as close to flawless execution as possible. We have to make sure every store is staffed right, every hour of every day, our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been.  On June 26, we announced our leadership transition plan. And yesterday we announced the next evolution of AutoZone's senior most leadership team. I've had the honor and privilege of being part of this team for nearly 29 years now. And it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We, as part of that leadership transition plan, announced that I would step away from the President and CEO roles, but remain Executive Chairman in January.  As a Board we've been contemplating this transition for many, many years, and began a very robust well-defined disciplined process nearly three years ago. Our goal was to identify a successor and ensure that successor had a fabulous team with them. I think we've accomplished that goal. The company will be in fantastic hands with Phil Danielle leading it. He loves this business, is a car fanatic, and has been here for 30 years, and in the industry for nearly 40 years. With Jamere Jackson leading the finance and store development teams and Tom Newbern now serving as our Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the balance of our talented executive team, our company is in terrific hands.  While it will be bittersweet for me, I'm excited that Phil and the Board have asked me to continue to be very involved for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, I know Phil, Jamere, Tom and I all know, this is a team sport and ultimately it's not about the senior most leaders in this organization. It's about in our case, the pledge, our values, and most importantly, our culture, which at its core is all about having the best most passionate AutoZoners taking care of customers, and the organization prioritizing AutoZoners and their development, or we say -- as we say, caring about others.  Yesterday, we announced another organization changes with the promotion, Bill Hackney to Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. I congratulate Bill, a 38 year AutoZoner who knows this business exceptionally well and has always been a top performer. We also announced that three terrific long term leaders will be retiring around the end of the calendar year. I thank and congratulate Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel, for their partnership, leadership and friendship for all these years. They leave AutoZone a massively better organization than they found it many years ago.  So changes in the air, frankly, it always is. It's amazing to me to see how much our leadership has changed over my near 30 year tenure at AutoZone. To me, that's why the culture. It's why the culture is so important in this organization. With a phenomenal culture, it's not about individuals. It's about the team. It's about the goals, and it's about performance. As we begin this transition, Phil and I both shared that not only do we both feel we embody the culture, both of us believe we are products of this culture.  We've learned extraordinary lessons from our three decades at AutoZone. Most importantly, always put the customer first, execution wins. People want to play on winning teams and be recognized for their performance. Details matter. Listen to those closest to the customer, and so much more. Phil and I, both continue to say, and it may sound like a clich\u00e9, but we believe it. AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us.  Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is live. \nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nPhilip Daniele: Hey, Bret. \nBret Jordan: You called out market share gain in the commercial space in the fourth quarter. Then you said, not in line with your aspirations. But then also said that pricing is rational. What do you think is happening in the space? Are there peers that are showing relatively better in-stocks? Or really was it just your regional footprint and exposure to some of those softer markets that made the difference? \nBill Rhodes: It's a terrific question, Bret. And there's a lot of different elements as you would expect. Again, we are not satisfied with our commercial growth at this level. And we're going to change that, and we're encouraged about the direction that we're heading. I think part of it Bret is a comparison versus last year. You mentioned in-stocks. Last year, 18 months ago, we got very aggressive with some key categories and a lot of merchandise, when frankly a lot of our less sophisticated competitors were not in great in-stock positions.  As we're beginning to lap that significant outsized growth last year, that's certainly a challenge for us. And we're beginning to get past that point in time. We also mentioned that we've had some challenges in the Midwest and Northeast, particularly with under cart categories, and particularly in commercial where we just didn't have that winner that we so desperately want and need. And we've suffered in those under cart categories.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And a big picture question, I guess on the international. When you look at the, obviously different vehicle demographic and economy, but how do you see the underlying growth rates in the DIY and the DIFM segments in Brazil and Mexico, sort of on a longer term basis?\nBill Rhodes: That's a great question. We've been in Mexico for nearly 25 years now. There's just not great data there, Bret. And so you don't have the terrific kind of information that we get from the Auto Care Association. So we don't have great data down there. We're working to try to see if we can get some better data. But what we know is we've been in Mexico now, as I said, almost 25 years and we continue to grow significantly and think that we have a lot of growth left in front of us, not just in new stores but on same store sales.  There are still categories where we are massively under penetrated, there are still categories we don't participate in at all. And as we learn more about that business, we're continuing to grow. Same things happened in Brazil. We're just much earlier in Brazil. \nBret Jordan: But fair to think an older car base that drives a better underlying growth than U.S. \nBill Rhodes: I think in Mexico, clearly the car basis is older, and there's a lot of U.S. cars, there's also a lot of Mexico manufactured vehicles. Brazil is very different in that the size of the vehicles and in particularly, the engine sizes in Brazil are massively smaller. I mean, if you have a two liter engine in Brazil, that's a big car. Many of them are 1.4 liters and the like. So we still got a lot to learn in Brazil. But we're excited about where we are. We believe we see a path to great success, but we're still losing money there. We got to fix that over the next couple of years. \nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you. \nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nSimeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to the retirees and promotees. My first question is, I may have missed, is double digits still the goal for commercial? And if so what's the -- how should we think about the timeframe to getting there? \nBill Rhodes: Absolutely is still the goal. Keep in mind, we still have pretty low share in that, 4.5% range or so. So we're under share. And we think there's still tremendous opportunity for us to gain share. Like we said, we're not happy with our performance in the Q4 timeframe. We do feel like we're exiting the quarter at a higher rate, and we believe will continue to improve from this point forward. But we're not back to where we want to be. But we do see line of sight to getting back to that double digit growth over time. \nSimeon Gutman : And then maybe the follow up, the way you've built the business in commercial, it's been methodical, and you've had some periods of faster growth. But it's been cumulative. And my question is now that you're focused on it, again, how do we get comfortable with timing that, prescriptively, your business really accelerates, call it in the next few quarters versus why not take the year to get some of the traction from the things that you're working on? \nBill Rhodes: Well, like I said, we talked, in Q3 or Q4 that our execution in the commercial arena wasn't where we expected it to be. And we've been working on that. We saw that performance and the execution levels improve as we worked through Q4. We're not finished yet. We'll frankly, never be finished. Execution is a long term strategy. But we continue to get better. And we think we continue to improve our business model. Like we said, we've opened up more hubs, more mega hubs. We continue to strengthen our store side assortments. And we're also continuing to leverage the technology enhancements that we've made over the last couple of years.  And those will continue to mature. And we're not standing still. That technology enhancements will continue as we move through this next year. \nSimeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Your line is live.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I'll add my congrats as well on all the new roles. Hey, want to follow up on the commercial business. And that last point, if you could maybe just elaborate on the execution shortfalls that you've seen. What are we talking about here, is that availability? Is it something more sales-related? Just any more context on that and how you're fixing that and the response so far? And then I'll add a follow up. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Now on the execution -- thanks for the question. On the execution, I think if you go back to the pandemic, and some of the challenges of the pandemic, we obviously struggled with in-stock. We struggled with staffing, as everybody did. And we struggled with store level execution. Our primary objectives were keep our AutoZoners safe, take care of the customers, keep our stores in-stock.  Nothing, there wasn't any -- this big one area that got broken. It was a lot of little things. And at AutoZone, we expect to operate executionally solid every single day. We didn't achieve that. We're continuing to work on that. And we're taking off the execution marks to get back to flawless execution day in and day out. That frankly, takes time and it will continue to improve. We liked the improvements we saw in Q4. I wouldn't say we're done. We think there's still opportunities to improve and we'll continue down that path. It's just part of our culture. Execute flawlessly.\nSeth Sigman: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow-up on another point made earlier about traffic and volume improving through the quarter, and I think that coincides with inflation moderating. Can you just give us a little bit more perspective on what you've seen historically, as it relates to elasticity? And then just in general, how are you thinking about inflation for this coming fiscal year? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. So the first point I'll make on inflation is that, we've been comping hyperinflation relative to our store industry trends for quite some time now. And so as inflation has sort of moderated and faded to sort of the normal rates, those are the dynamics that we've been experiencing. As it relates to our business moving forward, we expect inflation to be in the low-to-mid single digit range that will impact our tickets. On the DIY side, as we've said, we've historically seen transaction counts decline kind of low single digits, if you will.  And so we expect to be operating our business closer to historic norms moving forward. In terms of the macro environment, and how that's played out from an inflation standpoint. We haven't seen to this point, sort of a wobble from the consumer. We think it's been a two-speed world for a while where the low end consumer has been under some pressure, but consumers that have higher incomes have been doing well. And the net result of that is our business on the DIY side has been very, very resilient.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is live.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great, thank you. I just, a question on expansion and store growth. I mean, just given that the cost of construction and the cost of capital has gone up quite a bit in the last couple of years, how are you thinking about capital allocation? Just it seems like store growth is a pretty big part of your long term plans. But just thinking about where that capital can be best deployed, in which areas, maybe rural areas, or international, where you think you're going to get the best return?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah, thank you, Liz. We think we're going t o get a great return basically, in all three countries, whether that be urban environments or rural environments. And I go back to when you're running a ROIC of 50%, that shows that we can get really good returns. Yes, we're making this announcement when construction costs are higher, interest rates are higher and on and on. We're making decisions that are 40-year decisions. And we believe we've got a long runway for opening significant amounts of new stores. And once we finished that strategic review back in June, we made the decision that we're going to accelerate and get back to 500 stores a year.  Now remember, that'll be between 3% and 3.5% organic store growth. So it's not like we're talking about going to 10% growth. We think having something that's growing in that range makes a lot of sense for the long term.\nJamere Jackson: Now the only thing I'll add, Liz, is that, to your point around capital allocation, this doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework. Managing our leverage target at 2.5 times EBITDAR gives us a tremendous amount of financial firepower, to invest in our existing assets, to invest in this growth profile that Bill's talking about, but also to give meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders. So doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework as we move forward.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great, thank you. And then, you talked about Mexico and Brazil. Now in Brazil, you're still losing some money there. What does the profit profile look like in Mexico or just for the international operations in total? And how should we think about the impact on the total company margin profile as those stores grow as a percentage of AutoZone's total?\nBill Rhodes: Well, it's certainly a tale of two countries. We are losing money in Brazil. We haven't disclosed specifics in Mexico, but I'll just say that we are very pleased with the profitability profile, and particularly the return profile in Mexico.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great, thank you. \nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Also wanted to follow up on the commercial side. You talked about 7% in the last four weeks. So to clarify was that comped, and as we look forward, clearly August was hot, and you got a weather bump there. So you talked about improving from what you've seen. I guess, what's the right trend line to think about of the 7% versus the 2.5% that you actually did for the quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah, the 7%, just to be clear, was a total growth in those last four weeks of the quarter. So it improved over the quarter timeframe. I'd like to forecast that we're going to improve from there. It could be bumpy. Nothing's a straight line. I'll tell you, if you think about the weather performance over the quarter, like we said, the beginning parts of the quarter, the first month of May and June, were particularly cool and wet. And although that had probably a more material impact on the DIY side of the business, it impacts commercial as well.  And as it got hot, you see those bigger ticket categories, like per se, air conditioning, for example. Those are big categories and big jobs. And as you get those failures due to heat, it helps the comps and the total growth. So we think that weather story will help us a little bit. The hot summer will help us as we move through the beginning of Q4. And then we'll move into a normal weather pattern as we as we go through Q2 and the rest of the year.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it? And then -- okay, got it. So the 7% was total. So the comp side of it [ph] for me was more like a 5%, I guess. Is that right? And then as you think about '24, any other high level comments? I know you don't guide. Jamere, you talked about some LIFO tailwinds that, persist early, and then probably turn to some year-over-year headwinds. Anything else to think about in the P&L in terms of SG&A per store, or other comments on gross margin and so forth? Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. So as we think about FY24, I think there are a handful of dynamics that you need to sort of wrap your mind around as you build your models. Number one, we're forecasting a very consistent and resilient DIY business. And Phil and Bill talked about some of those dynamics as part of their prepared comments.  The second dynamic that we're focused on, as Phil alluded to, is an improving growth profile in our commercial business, again, we were very pleased with where we exited the fourth quarter. I believe we got the momentum going into the first quarter and next year. I think the third dynamic that you mentioned is around LIFO. We've got $59 million of LIFO that we expect to largely get back through the P&L. So as you're working your way through your modeling, you can expect most, if not all of that, to come back to us this year.  And then from an expense profile standpoint we said longer term SG&A will grow in line with sales. We are an investment mode, particularly in IT in some of the areas that are underpinning some of the growth initiatives that we're talking about. So that's how I focus.  And then the last one I just mentioned is just on -- from an international standpoint. You've seen us post our international numbers. This morning, we've got two years, quite frankly, where the business has been on fire. And we're very excited about the growth profile in our international business. So as you think about where we are, we feel good about the growth prospects going forward. We think, from a margin standpoint, we've made tremendous strides in gross margin excluding LIFO. And we've got a consistent, resilient domestic DIY business, which still is the lion's share of our businesses as we move forward. \nChristopher Horvers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is live.\nHenry Carr : Hi, this is Henry Carr on behalf of Michael Lasser. Good morning, and thanks for taking our question. We've been hearing about elevated levels of deferred maintenance and weak car counts in the industry. When thinking about returning to a sustainable high single digit or low double digit growth in commercial, how are you factoring in this occurrence, is it a reaffirmed goal? And is there any way to quantify it? \nBill Rhodes: Yeah, we don't have terrific data on that. Obviously, we're in our commercial customer shops all the time. And we're hearing the same things. Frankly, we've been hearing it since about February that car counts are down, particularly for people that are in the tire business. And as you know, when a technician takes off a tire, it provides a whole another opportunity for sales. You get a chance to see what's going on with the braking systems and chassis systems and the like.  So we don't have a great history on what are the exact members, but we think it is -- has been a softer environment. I think some of that has to do with the economic challenges that we're seeing. We haven't operated in the commercial business at this level for a long period of time. So we don't know the cycles like we do in the DIY business. But I think our belief is when economic pressures happen we get trade down from DIY to DIFM or sorry, from DIFM to DIY in certain cases. And I suspect that's what we're experiencing now.  How long will that last? You tell me what the economic cycle is going to look like. And again, we have a lot of discussions about short term sales performance. Our focus is not on the short term sales performance. Our focus is on what are we doing in our business to make our business better competitively? And how are we going to grow sales and share profitably over the long term? \nHenry Carr : Thank you. And just as a quick follow up, I believe the mega hubs came in at 13 in fourth quarter, and if I'm not mistaken that might be a little bit short of where you were targeting for '22 to '25 for full year, fiscal year '23. Are most of these openings just going to roll into 2023? Is there another way we should think about it? Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: You want me to do Jamere's performance review in public?\nJamere Jackson: I was just going to say, did he pay you to ask that question? So obviously, store development falls under my purview. We are short of where we need to be and when Phil and Bill talked about things that we need to execute better on, certainly what we're doing from a store development standpoint, fits squarely in that category. As I said, last quarter, we got 20 open this past fiscal year. We would have liked that number to be closer to 25. But what I'll tell you is that our pipeline is very strong as we move into FY24. And we're committed to get to the 200 number. So you'll see us start to accelerate that mega hub target.  And it's important for our business. It's important not just for the commercial business, but also for the DIY business, because of the outsized growth that we see in our mega hubs. So we're working our way through it, and we'll get better as we move forward.\nHenry Carr : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is live.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is also on the commercial business, just in terms of where you're not getting as much share, as you expected. Is it in more in the national accounts versus [indiscernible] security accounts? Are there any specific regions that are underperforming your expectations?\nPhilip Daniele: Yeah, I mean, there's -- the national account versus what we call the UDS account or the general repair shop down the street, the business growth between the two has been pretty consistent. Frankly, I will say within some of those national accounts, I think it's been more around two segments that have not performed as well for us recently. One is the used car market, kind of the buy-here, pay-here, growth has not been as good and the used car markets that are sold within new car dealerships, those markets haven't been as good for us.  And like Bill mentioned earlier, the groups that deal with tires have been softer. We didn't have a great winter. Those tire changes, going from a summer tire to a winter tire and vice versa, didn't happen like you would normally expect. And as Bill mentioned, when you pull that tire off, and you get to see that the brakes are rusted and the calipers frozen and the suspension parts aren't working as well as they should be, or maybe something's broken, that opportunity to get the wheel off, just generates a bigger repair.  Now the other thing is, as people push maintenance off, there becomes more failures in the repair cycle. So longer term, pushing that deferred maintenance off is good for us. But those have been the pressure points over the last couple of months.\nSeth Basham: Understand those being the pressure points, but would you assess those are also the areas where you're not getting as much share as you expected?\nPhilip Daniele: Yeah, I don't know that we're not gaining share in those categories. I think, over the last couple of years, we know we've grown a significant share in some of those categories. I believe everybody would be down pretty commensurately. And some of those categories aren't going to return to a more normal cycle until you go through another winter cycle of snow. So I think they will be depressed. We'll see those categories, be under a little bit of pressure until we get through another normal winter cycle.\nBill Rhodes: So I'll add that I do think, like we said earlier, we have -- we grew share exponentially over a couple of years. And part of that was because our in-stock position was massively better, certainly than our WD competitors. I think we've ceded some of that share back to them as they've gotten back in-stock.\nSeth Basham: Yeah, that's exactly my follow up is going to be Bill, just thinking about that in-stock position, when we start to cycle that improvement by your competitors, is that here into the fiscal first quarter, or is it going to take another couple of quarters?\nBill Rhodes: I think we're beginning to cycle it now. But as you said, it's going to take some time not every category was the same, not everyone competitor was the same. So we'll probably be dealing with it for six more months but we probably past the height of it.\nSeth Basham: Great. Thanks, guys. \nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today will be coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is live.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. So I guess I'm still confused, outside of whether what has the main execution challenge has been on the commercial segment? Part one. And then part two, kind of related to that is, what specific changes are you making to the business to help accelerate growth as we kind of roll here into -- further into '24? Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thanks, Scot. I think the answer is there's not one single thing. I think we tried to make that clear. We -- as we've said, for the last two quarters, we were operating differently during the pandemic. Everybody had to operate differently. Because we were having to make decisions on the fly every day. As we've come out of the pandemic, we've lost a few of our disciplines. These are things like writing the right schedule. We've experienced exceptionally high turnover. We don't have the same level of, of experience in our stores that we had then.  And we've just got to get back to making sure that we're dotting the I's and crossing the t's. And we're delivering parts on time, that we've got the right hand stock levels, and on and on and on. There is not one major thing. These are thousand paper cuts. That has been the hallmark of this organization. I put our execution up against anybody. And we weren't as sharp as we needed to be, and we're making those improvements today.\nScot Ciccarelli: And then specific changes you're making. Is it just better blocking and tackling for lack of a better term Bill?\nBill Rhodes: I think that that is the biggest change that we're making. But that's not the sole thing that we're doing. Phil mentioned that we got a lot of technology that we've deployed in the commercial business. Over the last six months we've really refined that technology. And we're excited about what it means. We have two or three major technological enhancements that are coming in the first quarter or two this year, specifically in the commercial business that are all focused on how do we execute better? How do we decrease delivery times? How do we make sure that we're delivering the right parts at the right time? And we're excited about that.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: All right. Thank you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe our industry is in a strong position. And our business model is solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.  As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Philip Daniele",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. I'm honored to be participating in my first earnings release conference call.  I will start by reviewing our Q4 overall same store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, and merchandise categories that drove our performance as well as any regional disparities. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think inflation will impact our business in FY24.  Our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter, on top of last year's exceptionally strong 6.2% growth. I do want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago, our execution improved materially over the quarter. And that execution, which is a hallmark of our success will ultimately deliver better results as we move forward. Our domestic commercial business grew 3.9%. Despite lower than anticipated, we believe we grew share and set another fourth quarter record with $1.5 billion in sales.  For the full year, we generated nearly $4.6 billion up 8.7% from last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, which is identical to last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, material improvements and hub and mega hub coverage, in addition to aggressive growth in the number of those types of stores.  We continue to strengthen the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality products. And we continue to deliver technological enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently with improvements in delivery time and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q4, we opened 156 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them late in the quarter, which had minimal impact on sales, but positions us well for FY24 and beyond.  With these moves, we now have commercial in over 90% of our domestic stores. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for commercial sales growth in FY24 and beyond. We're also very proud of our performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's comp of 1.1%. Additionally for the year, we delivered 1.8% DIY on top of a 2.9% DIY comp last fiscal year, and 11.2% comp in FY21. These results are very solid considering the outsized growth we saw during the pandemic.  The fact that we continue to retain the vast majority of the share we built during the pandemic, and our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY24.  Now let's focus on the sales cadence. Over the quarter, which spanned 16 weeks, early May through the end of August, as Bill mentioned, our same store sales were flat over the first weeks, but increased to 3.4% over the last eight weeks. We were encouraged by the trends we saw as the quarter ended.  Regarding weather, in May and June we experienced cooler and wetter weather trends across the country which negatively impacted our sales trends. By July however, it became very hot across much of the country, and it remained very hot through August. The heat and the associated rebound in sales helped us partially overcome a relatively mild winter, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast, where weather sensitive hard part categories underperformed our expectation. We anticipate that the summer heat will give us some positive momentum as we head into fall. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either hot or cold drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance.  Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 0.8% while our ticket was up 2%. Our transaction count improved as the quarter went along, and in fact, turned positive over the last eight weeks of the quarter. However, the average ticket being up only 2% was the weakest quarterly increase we've seen since FY 2000, as we lapped significantly higher inflation a year ago, where the ticket was up 8%.  Regarding commercial trends, we continue to see traffic and ticket growth, but our commercial ticket growth, just like retail, has shown a marked deceleration compared to recent history as hyperinflation begins to abate. For perspective, our ticket growth was 11% in Q4 last year, versus roughly 2% this year. As expected, some of our commercial customers are experiencing trade down and lower car count as the consumer comes under economic pressure.  In order to continue to grow our comps in '24 we will have to continue to increase share of wallet with our customers. The share data we see continues to encourage us that we are gaining share in the industry despite the macro trends, but recently, not in line with our aspirations, which we intend to change. During the quarter there were some geographic regions that did perform differently than others as there always are. This quarter we saw a material 315 basis point difference between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and the Midwest performing lower.  As the Northeast in the Midwest experienced a very mild, mild winter, with below average snowfall, we've seen less weather sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Headed into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we are not anticipating that weather will have a significant impact on sales.  Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories outperformed our hard part categories. And our hard part business was essentially flat for the quarter. As I said previously, weather sensitive hard parts were clearly impacted by the milder winter weather, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast.  Let me also address inflation in pricing. This quarter, we saw low single-digit inflation and as a result, our ticket average was up roughly 2%. We believe inflation for the first quarter will be similar to the fourth quarter as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels and lapping high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.  Historically, as costs have increased the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry historically has not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost and we believe we have entered one of those periods. For the first quarter of 2024 we expect our DIY sales to be resilient and our commercial trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.  Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our supply chain. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive sales growth with speed to customer and expanded availability.  Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexican and Brazilian businesses. With 804 stores open internationally or 12% of our store base these businesses had impressive performance last fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Hey, Bret. Yeah, I mean, there's -- the national account versus what we call the UDS account or the general repair shop down the street, the business growth between the two has been pretty consistent. Frankly, I will say within some of those national accounts, I think it's been more around two segments that have not performed as well for us recently. One is the used car market, kind of the buy-here, pay-here, growth has not been as good and the used car markets that are sold within new car dealerships, those markets haven't been as good for us.  And like Bill mentioned earlier, the groups that deal with tires have been softer. We didn't have a great winter. Those tire changes, going from a summer tire to a winter tire and vice versa, didn't happen like you would normally expect. And as Bill mentioned, when you pull that tire off, and you get to see that the brakes are rusted and the calipers frozen and the suspension parts aren't working as well as they should be, or maybe something's broken, that opportunity to get the wheel off, just generates a bigger repair.  Now the other thing is, as people push maintenance off, there becomes more failures in the repair cycle. So longer term, pushing that deferred maintenance off is good for us. But those have been the pressure points over the last couple of months. Yeah, I don't know that we're not gaining share in those categories. I think, over the last couple of years, we know we've grown a significant share in some of those categories. I believe everybody would be down pretty commensurately. And some of those categories aren't going to return to a more normal cycle until you go through another winter cycle of snow. So I think they will be depressed. We'll see those categories, be under a little bit of pressure until we get through another normal winter cycle."

            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Phil Danielle, our CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.  Regarding the fourth quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the investor relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their incredible contributions during fiscal 2023 that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states they continued putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 7.4% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 12.9%. It's important to remember that these results build on the phenomenal three year performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022.  Candidly, Phil, Jamere, Tom Newbern, and I felt at some point we would see our sales per store migrate closer to pre-pandemic levels. That hasn't happened. And at this stage, we do not expect it will. To put it in perspective, our domestic average weekly sales per store are 33% higher than in 2019, growing from $35,600 a week to $47,300 a week. This level of growth and sales also drove enormous growth in operating profit, where this year's $3.474 billion was 61% above 2019, when adjusted for the 2,019, 53 week. That is remarkable growth, especially for a 44-year old enterprise. We could not have achieved this success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization.  We have several updates for you this morning. First, I'm sure you've noticed the new table in our press release. We are now presenting our same store sales results for domestic, international and total company. We're also reporting our international same store sales, which includes both Mexico and Brazil, on both an actual and constant currency basis.  Why the change? The answer is International is becoming a larger and larger part of our business, and we are investing a sizable amount of our growth capital in those countries. As we evaluate important growth metrics, we think it is important to assess it in total. As we know this is a change we are committed to providing you with each component individually for at least five quarters, as our objective is to enhance your visibility.  Next, our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter compared to 1.9% last quarter, and about half of our fiscal 2023 growth of 3.1%. Our performance in retail was respectable and generally in line with our expectations. But as was well documented last quarter, our commercial sales performance in the second half of our fiscal year declined meaningfully and to us unacceptably. We ended with 3.9% growth in domestic commercial sales.  Our performance in both retail and commercial in the first half of the quarter was disappointing, but during this period we experienced very mild weather. As we reached the second half of the quarter, and temperatures escalated materially, so did our sales. Specifically for the first eight weeks of the quarter our retail comps were flat, but increased 3.4% in the second half. Commercial experienced a similar trajectory, ending particularly strong in the last four weeks of the quarter, up over 7%.  Regarding regional results, we saw a material performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. The total comp difference was well over 300 basis points and over 450 basis points for commercial. We attribute this to the lack of winter weather and snowfall in the latter part of last winter in that region. This has led to lower growth trends in undercar categories. Both those are things that \"happened to us, not what we did to enhance and improve our performance.\"  Last quarter, we highlighted that we were not executing at our peak levels. We have made many changes since then, and are pleased with the improvements in execution we are seeing. We aren't there yet. But we're on a really good path. We also recently completed another strategic review of our commercial business. We have validated our direction and have some exciting new enhancements that we will be testing over the next few quarters. We also made significant improvements in the information technology that we use to operate our commercial business, and we opened many more commercial programs, reaching 90% domestic penetration for the first time in our history.  Even more encouraging is how strong those new openings are starting and how many -- many weeks -- or they're just a few weeks old. Ultimately we will operate in a favorable and unfavorable macro and weather environment. We want to share our perspectives with you so you can understand our performance. But ultimately, it is our actions that will determine our long term success. And we're encouraged by the actions we're taking.  Finally, our strategy supporting our store operations and commercial teams includes several other key elements. Global new store growth, where we disappointingly didn't achieve our goals in FY23, more on that later; continued growth with our hubs and in particular, mega hubs, where we are nearing the halfway point of our ultimate goal of having 200 mega hubs and 300 hubs.  It's important to reinforce the continued, very strong performance of these stores, especially the mega hubs, and particularly in commercial; reconfiguring our global supply chain to efficiently process the enhanced sales we have achieved and expect to achieve over the next decade, while optimizing our processes for handling more direct import products from many countries, and more challenging slow turning parts assortments that are critical to our success; and finally continuing to lean in hard on technology improvements to make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable, efficient and effective.  I've given you the high level sound bites on the quarter's results. Now I'd like to introduce Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil? Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year, live the pledge. I know this sounds like a very consistent theme for AutoZone. In fact, it was the theme we used in my first full year as CEO in 2006.  I'm asked frequently, what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer goes back to the same point over and over, the culture. I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never emphasize the culture enough. The culture is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It's based on a team-based approach recognizing everyone's contributions and performance and putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity.  It's about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility. And it is so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategies succinctly. As we've accelerated our top line since the onset of the pandemic, our competitive positioning has also materially improved. Our efforts for 2024 will be focused on execution. We have a lot of projects in flight, and we did get them completed. Supply chain improvements will remain a key focus in FY24.  We will continue with our additions of mega hub and hub stores, new distribution centers and international store growth. As you noticed our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 14.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now.  This morning, I'm excited to share after an extensive strategic review of the ultimate number of locations we can have in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. We are announcing our plans for a much more aggressive global store development plan. Over the last five years we've averaged 140 domestic store openings and 50 international openings for a total of roughly 190 new stores a year in the Americas. We plan on accelerating this pace and aspire to open as many as 500 stores five years from now.  So by FY28 we are modeling 500 store openings with the split being 300 in the U.S., 200 internationally. FY24 we will remain around 200, but we will ramp from there. You may be asking why this change of strategy and why now? The answer is our profitability per store is materially higher since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to find new trade areas even in our more mature U.S. markets. Our growth in commercial has materially changed the economics on a per-store basis. We believe this is just the beginning on commercial, and our ROIC, one of the most important metrics we track is over 50%.  Also our international markets are immature. So we continue to see expansion opportunities in Mexico and Brazil, along with putting a toehold at some point in other new markets. I want to stress that we will be diligent and disciplined. We have a long track record of performance with high returns and strong cash flow generation. We have no plans on changing that strategy and approach, where we believe in evolution over revolution. We believe in continuous improvement and we believe in test and learn.  We have been, and remain anchored on our capital allocation strategy. While I spent time talking about our store development strategies for the future, that is not the key focus for us in FY24. The number one focus will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to sales growth. We're excited as we start 2020.  This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this year, $17.5 billion in sales, racing past the $17 billion milestone. DIY comps are 1.8%, most impressively 15.9% on a three year basis. Commercial sales are now $4.6 billion. I personally distinctly remember a goal of $1 billion not that long ago. Average weekly sales domestically of $47,600, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually.  Our Mexico and all data [ph] teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count, and getting to profitability breakeven on the path to substantial profitability in the future. We bought back 3.7 billion in AutoZone stock, the second highest ever, only behind last year's 4.4 billion. And our team has grown our EBIT by 61% in four years. That's remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels. And we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure.  As I've said on several occasions, we have to exit pandemic mode. We had to get back to taking care of the customer. And this requires as close to flawless execution as possible. We have to make sure every store is staffed right, every hour of every day, our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been.  On June 26, we announced our leadership transition plan. And yesterday we announced the next evolution of AutoZone's senior most leadership team. I've had the honor and privilege of being part of this team for nearly 29 years now. And it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We, as part of that leadership transition plan, announced that I would step away from the President and CEO roles, but remain Executive Chairman in January.  As a Board we've been contemplating this transition for many, many years, and began a very robust well-defined disciplined process nearly three years ago. Our goal was to identify a successor and ensure that successor had a fabulous team with them. I think we've accomplished that goal. The company will be in fantastic hands with Phil Danielle leading it. He loves this business, is a car fanatic, and has been here for 30 years, and in the industry for nearly 40 years. With Jamere Jackson leading the finance and store development teams and Tom Newbern now serving as our Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the balance of our talented executive team, our company is in terrific hands.  While it will be bittersweet for me, I'm excited that Phil and the Board have asked me to continue to be very involved for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, I know Phil, Jamere, Tom and I all know, this is a team sport and ultimately it's not about the senior most leaders in this organization. It's about in our case, the pledge, our values, and most importantly, our culture, which at its core is all about having the best most passionate AutoZoners taking care of customers, and the organization prioritizing AutoZoners and their development, or we say -- as we say, caring about others.  Yesterday, we announced another organization changes with the promotion, Bill Hackney to Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. I congratulate Bill, a 38 year AutoZoner who knows this business exceptionally well and has always been a top performer. We also announced that three terrific long term leaders will be retiring around the end of the calendar year. I thank and congratulate Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel, for their partnership, leadership and friendship for all these years. They leave AutoZone a massively better organization than they found it many years ago.  So changes in the air, frankly, it always is. It's amazing to me to see how much our leadership has changed over my near 30 year tenure at AutoZone. To me, that's why the culture. It's why the culture is so important in this organization. With a phenomenal culture, it's not about individuals. It's about the team. It's about the goals, and it's about performance. As we begin this transition, Phil and I both shared that not only do we both feel we embody the culture, both of us believe we are products of this culture.  We've learned extraordinary lessons from our three decades at AutoZone. Most importantly, always put the customer first, execution wins. People want to play on winning teams and be recognized for their performance. Details matter. Listen to those closest to the customer, and so much more. Phil and I, both continue to say, and it may sound like a cliche\u0301, but we believe it. AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us.  Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. It's a terrific question, Bret. And there's a lot of different elements as you would expect. Again, we are not satisfied with our commercial growth at this level. And we're going to change that, and we're encouraged about the direction that we're heading. I think part of it Bret is a comparison versus last year. You mentioned in-stocks. Last year, 18 months ago, we got very aggressive with some key categories and a lot of merchandise, when frankly a lot of our less sophisticated competitors were not in great in-stock positions.  As we're beginning to lap that significant outsized growth last year, that's certainly a challenge for us. And we're beginning to get past that point in time. We also mentioned that we've had some challenges in the Midwest and Northeast, particularly with under cart categories, and particularly in commercial where we just didn't have that winner that we so desperately want and need. And we've suffered in those under cart categories. That's a great question. We've been in Mexico for nearly 25 years now. There's just not great data there, Bret. And so you don't have the terrific kind of information that we get from the Auto Care Association. So we don't have great data down there. We're working to try to see if we can get some better data. But what we know is we've been in Mexico now, as I said, almost 25 years and we continue to grow significantly and think that we have a lot of growth left in front of us, not just in new stores but on same store sales.  There are still categories where we are massively under penetrated, there are still categories we don't participate in at all. And as we learn more about that business, we're continuing to grow. Same things happened in Brazil. We're just much earlier in Brazil. I think in Mexico, clearly the car basis is older, and there's a lot of U.S. cars, there's also a lot of Mexico manufactured vehicles. Brazil is very different in that the size of the vehicles and in particularly, the engine sizes in Brazil are massively smaller. I mean, if you have a two liter engine in Brazil, that's a big car. Many of them are 1.4 liters and the like. So we still got a lot to learn in Brazil. But we're excited about where we are. We believe we see a path to great success, but we're still losing money there. We got to fix that over the next couple of years. Thank you. Absolutely is still the goal. Keep in mind, we still have pretty low share in that, 4.5% range or so. So we're under share. And we think there's still tremendous opportunity for us to gain share. Like we said, we're not happy with our performance in the Q4 timeframe. We do feel like we're exiting the quarter at a higher rate, and we believe will continue to improve from this point forward. But we're not back to where we want to be. But we do see line of sight to getting back to that double digit growth over time. Well, like I said, we talked, in Q3 or Q4 that our execution in the commercial arena wasn't where we expected it to be. And we've been working on that. We saw that performance and the execution levels improve as we worked through Q4. We're not finished yet. We'll frankly, never be finished. Execution is a long term strategy. But we continue to get better. And we think we continue to improve our business model. Like we said, we've opened up more hubs, more mega hubs. We continue to strengthen our store side assortments. And we're also continuing to leverage the technology enhancements that we've made over the last couple of years.  And those will continue to mature. And we're not standing still. That technology enhancements will continue as we move through this next year. Now on the execution -- thanks for the question. On the execution, I think if you go back to the pandemic, and some of the challenges of the pandemic, we obviously struggled with in-stock. We struggled with staffing, as everybody did. And we struggled with store level execution. Our primary objectives were keep our AutoZoners safe, take care of the customers, keep our stores in-stock.  Nothing, there wasn't any -- this big one area that got broken. It was a lot of little things. And at AutoZone, we expect to operate executionally solid every single day. We didn't achieve that. We're continuing to work on that. And we're taking off the execution marks to get back to flawless execution day in and day out. That frankly, takes time and it will continue to improve. We liked the improvements we saw in Q4. I wouldn't say we're done. We think there's still opportunities to improve and we'll continue down that path. It's just part of our culture. Execute flawlessly. Yeah. So the first point I'll make on inflation is that, we've been comping hyperinflation relative to our store industry trends for quite some time now. And so as inflation has sort of moderated and faded to sort of the normal rates, those are the dynamics that we've been experiencing. As it relates to our business moving forward, we expect inflation to be in the low-to-mid single digit range that will impact our tickets. On the DIY side, as we've said, we've historically seen transaction counts decline kind of low single digits, if you will.  And so we expect to be operating our business closer to historic norms moving forward. In terms of the macro environment, and how that's played out from an inflation standpoint. We haven't seen to this point, sort of a wobble from the consumer. We think it's been a two-speed world for a while where the low end consumer has been under some pressure, but consumers that have higher incomes have been doing well. And the net result of that is our business on the DIY side has been very, very resilient. Yeah, thank you, Liz. We think we're going t o get a great return basically, in all three countries, whether that be urban environments or rural environments. And I go back to when you're running a ROIC of 50%, that shows that we can get really good returns. Yes, we're making this announcement when construction costs are higher, interest rates are higher and on and on. We're making decisions that are 40-year decisions. And we believe we've got a long runway for opening significant amounts of new stores. And once we finished that strategic review back in June, we made the decision that we're going to accelerate and get back to 500 stores a year.  Now remember, that'll be between 3% and 3.5% organic store growth. So it's not like we're talking about going to 10% growth. We think having something that's growing in that range makes a lot of sense for the long term. Well, it's certainly a tale of two countries. We are losing money in Brazil. We haven't disclosed specifics in Mexico, but I'll just say that we are very pleased with the profitability profile, and particularly the return profile in Mexico. Thank you. Yeah, the 7%, just to be clear, was a total growth in those last four weeks of the quarter. So it improved over the quarter timeframe. I'd like to forecast that we're going to improve from there. It could be bumpy. Nothing's a straight line. I'll tell you, if you think about the weather performance over the quarter, like we said, the beginning parts of the quarter, the first month of May and June, were particularly cool and wet. And although that had probably a more material impact on the DIY side of the business, it impacts commercial as well.  And as it got hot, you see those bigger ticket categories, like per se, air conditioning, for example. Those are big categories and big jobs. And as you get those failures due to heat, it helps the comps and the total growth. So we think that weather story will help us a little bit. The hot summer will help us as we move through the beginning of Q4. And then we'll move into a normal weather pattern as we as we go through Q2 and the rest of the year. Yeah, we don't have terrific data on that. Obviously, we're in our commercial customer shops all the time. And we're hearing the same things. Frankly, we've been hearing it since about February that car counts are down, particularly for people that are in the tire business. And as you know, when a technician takes off a tire, it provides a whole another opportunity for sales. You get a chance to see what's going on with the braking systems and chassis systems and the like.  So we don't have a great history on what are the exact members, but we think it is -- has been a softer environment. I think some of that has to do with the economic challenges that we're seeing. We haven't operated in the commercial business at this level for a long period of time. So we don't know the cycles like we do in the DIY business. But I think our belief is when economic pressures happen we get trade down from DIY to DIFM or sorry, from DIFM to DIY in certain cases. And I suspect that's what we're experiencing now.  How long will that last? You tell me what the economic cycle is going to look like. And again, we have a lot of discussions about short term sales performance. Our focus is not on the short term sales performance. Our focus is on what are we doing in our business to make our business better competitively? And how are we going to grow sales and share profitably over the long term? You want me to do Jamere's performance review in public? So I'll add that I do think, like we said earlier, we have -- we grew share exponentially over a couple of years. And part of that was because our in-stock position was massively better, certainly than our WD competitors. I think we've ceded some of that share back to them as they've gotten back in-stock. I think we're beginning to cycle it now. But as you said, it's going to take some time not every category was the same, not everyone competitor was the same. So we'll probably be dealing with it for six more months but we probably past the height of it. Thank you. Thanks, Scot. I think the answer is there's not one single thing. I think we tried to make that clear. We -- as we've said, for the last two quarters, we were operating differently during the pandemic. Everybody had to operate differently. Because we were having to make decisions on the fly every day. As we've come out of the pandemic, we've lost a few of our disciplines. These are things like writing the right schedule. We've experienced exceptionally high turnover. We don't have the same level of, of experience in our stores that we had then.  And we've just got to get back to making sure that we're dotting the I's and crossing the t's. And we're delivering parts on time, that we've got the right hand stock levels, and on and on and on. There is not one major thing. These are thousand paper cuts. That has been the hallmark of this organization. I put our execution up against anybody. And we weren't as sharp as we needed to be, and we're making those improvements today. I think that that is the biggest change that we're making. But that's not the sole thing that we're doing. Phil mentioned that we got a lot of technology that we've deployed in the commercial business. Over the last six months we've really refined that technology. And we're excited about what it means. We have two or three major technological enhancements that are coming in the first quarter or two this year, specifically in the commercial business that are all focused on how do we execute better? How do we decrease delivery times? How do we make sure that we're delivering the right parts at the right time? And we're excited about that. All right. Thank you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe our industry is in a strong position. And our business model is solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.  As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Phil. And good morning everyone. As both Bill and Phil had previously discussed we had a solid fourth quarter, stacked on top of an impressive fourth quarter last year. 6.4% total company sales growth, 1.7% domestic comp, a 14.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.8% increase in EBIT, and a 14.7% increase in EPS. In addition, our results for the entire fiscal year were very strong as total sales grew 7.4% and EPS grew 12.9%.  We continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total sales were just under $5.7 billion, up 6.4%. For the year our total sales were $17.5 billion, up 7.4% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY19. Our sales are up an amazing 47% or nearly $5.6 billion since 2019.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives starting with our domestic commercial business. For the fourth quarter our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.9% to $1.5 billion and up 25.9% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales.  Our average weekly sales per program were approximately $16,700, down 1.8%. Now it's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was impacted materially by the late in quarter openings of approximately 120 new programs. While these openings depressed the point in time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. These openings are part of our efforts to open more stores with commercial in response to the tremendous opportunity to grow our market share.  Our commercial acceleration initiatives are delivering the expected results, as we grow share by winning new business, and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program and approximately 90% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 156 net new programs, finishing with 5,682 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY23, and we feel good about our prospects heading into the New Year.  For FY23, our commercial sales were $4.6 billion, up 8.7% versus last year, and up 37% from two years ago. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we expect to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. To support our commercial growth we now have 98 mega hub locations with 13 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 98 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. In fact, our commercial mega hub business grew twice as fast as our overall commercial business in Q4.  As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.  We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs in the near term. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited and we're determined to build on our strong momentum.  On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 1.4% for the quarter. For FY23 our DIY crop grew 1.8% and 4.7% on a two year stack basis. The business continues to be remarkably resilient as we've managed to deliver positive comp growth through the cycle. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down slightly and 2% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining traffic counts offset by low to mid-single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.  Importantly, our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwind have driven a positive comp. We're forecasting a consistent and resilient DIY business environment for FY24.  Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. As you may have noticed, we changed our disclosure on our international business, and we will continue to do so going forward. With 12% of our total store base outside of the U.S., the current revenue contribution and the growth prospects moving forward, we simply have to share more about international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 27 new stores in Mexico to finish with 740 stores, and 17 new stores in Brazil ending with 100.  Our same store sales grew 34.1% on a reported basis and 14.9% on a constant currency basis. We remain committed to Mexico and Brazil, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. By 2028, after a robust strategic review of the market and ultimate store comp potential, we revised our strategy and anticipate opening as many as 200 stores annually in these markets in a disciplined fashion, making this an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.  Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margin. For the quarter our gross margin was 52.7%, up 118 basis points, driven primarily by a non-cash $30 million LIFO. credit this quarter. For Q4 last year, we had a $15 million LIFO charge. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 37 basis point improvement in gross margin.  I will point out that we now have $59 million in LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect these to largely reverse over FY24. We're currently modeling $15 million in LIFO credits in Q1 as inflation continues to abate, and we turn our inventory. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $59 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve.  Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.6% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 34 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.  Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10.8% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year benefit. EBIT for FY23 was just under $3.5 billion up 6.2% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $108.7 million, up 70% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q4 and last year.  We're planning interest in the $88 million range for the first quarter of FY24 versus $57.7 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.4% and up from last year's fourth quarter of 22.1%. This quarter's rate benefited 22 basis points from stock options exercised while last year had benefited 70 basis points. For the first quarter of FY24 we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.  Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $865 million, up 6.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.6 million was 6.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $46.46, up 14.7% for the quarter. For FY23 net income was $2.5 million, up 4.1% and earnings per share was $132.36, up 12.9%.  Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash and $701 million in free cash flow. For the year we generated $2.1 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong. And our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was down 0.6% versus Q4 last year while total inventory increased 2.2% over the same period last year driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $201,000 versus negative $240,000 last year, and negative $215,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 124.9% versus last year's Q4 of 129.5%.  Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.  We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts to cash to shareholders. We finished Q4 2.3 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to our leverage objectives, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target in FY24.  To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share.  I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders driven by a high degree of confidence in our strategy, and our exceptional team of AutoZoners.  One last housekeeping point, I'd like to remind you that in FY24, we will have a 53rd week in our financial results. This extra week will be added to our Q4 results. As a result, our fiscal year will now end August 31, 2024. In order to model that extra week, I encourage you to look at our financial breakouts of both our fiscal 2019 and 2,013 fourth quarters, which were the last two years we had the extra week and we show breakouts of the full P&L accordingly.  And now I'll turn it back to Bill. Now the only thing I'll add, Liz, is that, to your point around capital allocation, this doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework. Managing our leverage target at 2.5 times EBITDAR gives us a tremendous amount of financial firepower, to invest in our existing assets, to invest in this growth profile that Bill's talking about, but also to give meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders. So doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework as we move forward. Yeah. So as we think about FY24, I think there are a handful of dynamics that you need to sort of wrap your mind around as you build your models. Number one, we're forecasting a very consistent and resilient DIY business. And Phil and Bill talked about some of those dynamics as part of their prepared comments.  The second dynamic that we're focused on, as Phil alluded to, is an improving growth profile in our commercial business, again, we were very pleased with where we exited the fourth quarter. I believe we got the momentum going into the first quarter and next year. I think the third dynamic that you mentioned is around LIFO. We've got $59 million of LIFO that we expect to largely get back through the P&L. So as you're working your way through your modeling, you can expect most, if not all of that, to come back to us this year.  And then from an expense profile standpoint we said longer term SG&A will grow in line with sales. We are an investment mode, particularly in IT in some of the areas that are underpinning some of the growth initiatives that we're talking about. So that's how I focus.  And then the last one I just mentioned is just on -- from an international standpoint. You've seen us post our international numbers. This morning, we've got two years, quite frankly, where the business has been on fire. And we're very excited about the growth profile in our international business. So as you think about where we are, we feel good about the growth prospects going forward. We think, from a margin standpoint, we've made tremendous strides in gross margin excluding LIFO. And we've got a consistent, resilient domestic DIY business, which still is the lion's share of our businesses as we move forward. I was just going to say, did he pay you to ask that question? So obviously, store development falls under my purview. We are short of where we need to be and when Phil and Bill talked about things that we need to execute better on, certainly what we're doing from a store development standpoint, fits squarely in that category. As I said, last quarter, we got 20 open this past fiscal year. We would have liked that number to be closer to 25. But what I'll tell you is that our pipeline is very strong as we move into FY24. And we're committed to get to the 200 number. So you'll see us start to accelerate that mega hub target.  And it's important for our business. It's important not just for the commercial business, but also for the DIY business, because of the outsized growth that we see in our mega hubs. So we're working our way through it, and we'll get better as we move forward."

Sir, you may begin.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to providing our customers with WOW! Customer Service, which has been the secret to our long-term, consistent success. For the third quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 5.8%, which included a 1.9% domestic same store sales comp. While our topline results were below our expectations at the start of the quarter, our sales improved later in the quarter as we experienced improved weather. We were pleased to deliver operating profit growth north of 9% and EPS growth of 17.5%. Both our operating profit and EPS growth were the highest growth rates we've had in over a year. As many retailers have reported, March was a tough month, as cool, wet weather impacted customer traffic. In addition, snow accumulations were down significantly in February and March for much of the country, which also had some impact on our business. We mentioned in our last call that weather, particularly during tax refund season, really matters. Unfortunately, it was unfavorable this year, as our results reflect. We also, after rapid growth and extensive market share gains in commercial, experienced some headwinds this quarter and our growth was disappointing to us. We were lapping tremendous growth last year and had some internal and external factors that impacted our growth this quarter. We have had some sectors of this business that had been extremely challenged with rising interest rates and high used car prices. Additionally, during our rapid growth over the last couple of years, we also unintentionally de-emphasized some of our tried and true disciplines. As I've said for the last six months or so, as we exit pandemic mode, we must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution, which I believe will help us reignite topline growth. We have good initiatives in flight in both our retail and commercial businesses, and we are determined to move with urgency to reaccelerate our sales and share growth. Fortunately, as this difference between our domestic same store sales growth and our total sales growth implies, our international team, particularly in Mexico, delivered very strong sales growth for the quarter. Our teams in Mexico and Brazil continue to do a great job, offering differentiated customer experiences, which is leading to strong sales growth. This morning, we will review our third quarter same store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional callouts. We'll also share how inflation is, in fact, impacting our cost in retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY '23. Moving to the specifics for the quarter, domestic same store sales were up 1.9%; our net income was $648 million; and our earnings per share was $34.12, increasing 17.5%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 4.5% domestic same store sales comp; and on a three-year basis, a 33.4% stacked comp. Our three-year stacked comp was in line with what we've seen in the last three quarters. Domestic retail sales were up 2.2%, and our domestic commercial growth was 6.3%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records, with $1.11 billion in sales, as we generated an additional $66 million in sales than in Q3 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered $4.54 billion in annual commercial sales, up a strong 14.4% over last year. We also set another Q3 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,800. As I've mentioned earlier, March was a bit of an outlier in the quarter's domestic sales results. We had a greater than 3% comp in February, but fell to a negative 1% in March, before recovering back to just under 4% in April and early May. On a regional basis, we experienced slower growth in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets than the rest of the country. This held true for both our DIY and commercial businesses. Our business on the West Coast was in line with our remaining markets. Average ticket grew 4% in retail and commercial for the quarter, decreasing 1% from last year. After the most significant product cost inflation we have seen in decades, we are seeing those trends moderate and are negotiating some cost reductions from our vendors, as both product cost and freight inflation are slowing or have subsided. Additionally, while not anywhere close to historical norms, we saw wage inflation moderate to approximately 4%. While the staffing environment has substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation pulling back much from these levels, as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we've had to manage through external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives did just that this past quarter and included new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. While our sales moderated this past quarter, we remain focused on growing our share over time and becoming the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this quarter, we delivered a 0.6% comp. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 4% versus last year and our transaction count trends were down 3%. From the data we have available, we continued to gain both dollar and unit share during the quarter. Our sales floor outperformed hard parts, with approximately a 3% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales floor categories is attributable to both discretionary categories improving and the hard parts categories slowing. It was encouraging to see our sales floor items performing so well. Specifically, batteries, oil, and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this summer, as we expect miles driven improvements, while our growth initiatives continue delivering strong results. Let me also address our pricing strategies. In Q3, we continued experiencing mid-single digit pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the fourth quarter, as we are lapping the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. We remain excited about our growth initiatives, our team's focus on execution, and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both our retail and commercial businesses over the last few years. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by our commercial business, as we execute on opening additional hub and mega hub stores, have an improving in-stock position, and improve customer service. We also believe our DIY business will remain resilient, as the difficult macro environment is pointing customers to continue maintaining their vehicles. We will, as always, be transparent about what we're seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to reiterate our plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil, with almost 800 stores combined across these two markets. As previously noted, these businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be successful. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had solid results for our third quarter. This quarter, we delivered a 1.9% domestic comp growth, a 9.3% increase in EBIT, and a 17.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4.1 billion, up 5.8%, reflecting continued strength in our industry, solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 6.3% to just over $1.1 billion and were up just over 32% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,786, up 1.2%. We experienced growth across both our local customer base and national accounts, with local being the stronger of the two categories. Our results for the quarter set another record for highest weekly sales volume in the history of the chain at $92.5 million. I want to reiterate that our commercial business is strong and we believe we grew share despite a deceleration in our growth rates this quarter. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 26 net new programs, finishing with 5,526 total programs. As expected, commercial growth continues to lead the way in FY '23, and we continue to focus on growing our business faster. Our strategy remains intact, as we continue to gain share in the industry. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I'll add some color on our progress. We now have 85 mega hub locations, with four new ones opened in Q3. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was roughly $16,800, the 84 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and continued to grow significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q3. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network for both DIY and commercial. This strategy is working. We will open 22 to 25 new mega hubs in FY '23, and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. Many of you've heard me say that in the near term, our commercial business should grow double digits as far as the eye can see, and we maintain that conviction despite this quarter's results. We are significantly underpenetrated with a four to five share in an addressable market that is approaching $100 billion. The investments that we have made in our Duralast brand, expanding our coverage and assortment, adding more hubs and mega hubs, building technologies and improving our customer service continue to pay significant dividends and have a long runway. Nothing has changed in our views on what we can accomplish going forward, although we still have work to do to get back to this performance. Moving to our domestic retail business, we delivered a 0.6% comp in Q3. Like our domestic commercial business, retail has been resilient and we continue to grow share and deliver positive comp growth despite a dismal March. We exited the quarter much stronger and we're focused on execution in Q4. We saw a 4% ticket growth, as Bill mentioned, and we saw traffic down 3% from last year's levels. However, excluding the middle four weeks of the quarter, traffic was in line with last quarter, when we were down only 2%. This past quarter, we continued to gain unit and dollar share across the retail segment, a reflection of the relative strength of our business. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, with both the new and used car markets posing significant challenges for our customers. We expect these markets to remain challenged for a longer period of time than we originally assumed, which should be a tailwind for DIY. These dynamics, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of 2023. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened six new stores in Mexico to finish with 713 stores and two new stores in Brazil, ending with 83. On a constant currency basis, we continue to accelerate our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With just over 11% of our total store base currently outside the US and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, we are bullish on international growth and we're adding stores and supply chain capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was up 56 basis points, including a $17 million LIFO credit, which drove 42 basis points of improvement. Excluding the LIFO benefit, our gross margin increase over last year's quarter was driven by higher merchandise margins, which more than offset a drag from the commercial business mix. With this quarter's LIFO gain, we have taken our remaining LIFO balance to $89 million. And as I mentioned over the last few quarters, hyperinflation and freight cost was the primary driver for the charges we took in the P&L. Freight costs have continued to abate over the past several months, and we expect this trend to continue and drive a similar LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges that we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance, as we have done historically. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 5.5% versus last year's Q3, as SG&A levered 10 basis points versus last year. As we've said previously, we are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will continue to manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $858 million, up 9.3% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $17 million LIFO credit, EBIT would have been up 7.1% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $74.3 million, up 77% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q3-end last year. We are planning Interest expense in the $105 million area for the fourth quarter versus $64 million in last year's fourth quarter. Higher debt levels and higher borrowing rates, especially at the short end of the borrowing curve, are driving the increase in interest expense. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.4%, below last year's third quarter rate of 20.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 595 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 284 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $648 million, up 9.3% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 19 million was 7% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $34.12, up 17.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO credit, our net income would have increased 7.1% and our EPS growth would have been 15.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $554 million in free cash flow versus $682 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated just over $1.4 billion versus just over $1.6 billion a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 4.3% versus Q3 last year, and total inventory increased 7.4%, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives, and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $215,000 versus negative $216,000 last year and negative $227,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 126.5% versus last year's Q3 of 127.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $908 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter-end, we had just under $850 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet, and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 6% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.3 times EBITDAR, and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area. To wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and growing commercial and international businesses. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now, I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this past quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2023. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first are what define us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. This upcoming quarter will be very busy for us. We'll be opening over 100 stores in the Americas. We'll also remain focused on those initiatives that we have underway to grow sales in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned previously, we are doubling down on execution and are focused on driving share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Hi, good morning guys.\nBill Rhodes: Hi Bret.\nBret Jordan: Could you talk a little bit more about the internal factors that impacted growth? I think you said you'd deemphasized some internal disciplines in the prepared remarks. Could you maybe give us some more color there and maybe what the turnaround time on those disciplines might be?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, it's a great question, Bret. Thank you for it - yes, I would - I want to make - be very careful how I say this. We unintentionally deemphasize some of the processes and procedures that we have in place, and that's not to be surprising. During the pandemic, we had to do a lot of things differently. And also in the commercial business, in particular, we were growing very, very rapidly. And we just got away from some of the process, procedures that we have in place. And we are going back to those and reemphasizing those. But to your point, that's not going to turn around in a day. It's going to turn around in months, not days or weeks. And we're working very diligently on it today. But - it's some simple things like periodic - how are we deploying our sales force, what our national account focus is? And just things like that, that we have very disciplined processes that just in the midst of the pandemic, we kind of turned our back on a little bit.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then a question on the Q4 outlook, just given the call out of the weather impact in March, if we go back to past years like '17 or maybe 2012, where real mild winter negatively impacted the early summer. Are you seeing any of that as we go into the fourth quarter or was it really just sort of a one quarter event with the weather?\nBill Rhodes: I think that's a great question, too, Bret. And you're exactly right. We've seen it in the past. The one-time that's different this year is, we did have winter in December. So in 2017, we never had a winter. I also talked about that our brakes category has been a little bit softer. That can be a place where we see some lingering effects. I don't think it's going to be anywhere on the order of magnitude of what we saw in '17, but it might be a little bit softer.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Christopher, your line is life. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, good morning everybody.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning.\nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of questions on the top line, the rebound that you saw in April and May, can you talk about how DIY and Do-It-For-Me performed in that rebound? And Jamere, you talked about the low double-digit as far as the eye can see is your expectation that you can get back to that low double-digit pace in Do-It-For-Me in the fourth quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Chris, I'm going to let Jamere answer that second part if you don't mind. It was his statement. I think he's ready for that, too and I am as well. I think - the businesses trended very similarly. I think one of the things that I also pointed out, it was not just that the weather was poor. The weather hit us at the worst time of the year for us during the all-important tax refund season. You all have seen tax refunds were down a little bit this year. But to us, the bigger implication was the weather was just pretty awful. It was cold and wet and mild during that period of time. And so, we saw both businesses trend down and they both have improved at some level, like I called out in the prepared remarks. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So listen, as I said in my remarks, I mean, we're still committed to being a double-digit grower over time. We're underpenetrated; we have roughly a, four to five share and that gives us an opportunity to create a faster growing business. We're executing our growth playbook and that growth playbook, quite frankly, still has a lot of runway associated with it, and we saw significant share gains over the past three years. So things like improving the quality of our parts and our Duralast offerings, expanding our assortments with Mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology, the competitive pricing that we've done, all of those things still have a lot of legs associated with them. So when I think about what Bill talked about as it relates to execution, first, we believe that we grew share in commercial despite the growth rate deceleration. And secondly, we believe that those growth initiatives still have a lot of runway. And we have other initiatives in flight, as Bill mentioned, that we'll execute in Q4 and during FY '24 that we believe will accelerate growth. So nothing's changed in our strategy. Nothing has changed in our outlook as we move forward.\nBill Rhodes: I don't think anything has changed in our commitment. We need to be a double-digit grower in commercial. And we weren't this quarter.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then on the gross margin line, so - a two-part question. So as input and freight costs come down from your vendors, how are you thinking about maybe passing along some of that back to the consumer? Is that different from prior cycles? And then understandably, you're not - you're only going to get the LIFO back? But then ultimately, we get the turn of that inventory, and I know you're working hard to sort of leverage or increased scale with these vendors given the growth and Do-It-For-Me. So shouldn't we see have line of sight gross margin expansion beyond, just recapturing the LIFO headwinds?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, I'll take the first part and turn it back to Jamere to talk about LIFO. As far as - first of all, we have not seen meaningful reductions in product costs at this point in time. We have seen meaningful reductions in freight cost. But if you recall, we did not even attempt to pass on all the freight costs to our customers, because we knew it was somewhat of an anomaly, and would reverse course at some order of magnitude. So as we are beginning to see some product costs reductions, I don't anticipate that we will reduce pricing as a result of those. And for one really strong reason, our wage inflation has been more than double what we've experienced in my 28 years here. We have to somehow get paid for that wage inflation, too, in the P&L. And so, if we get some reduction in product costs, I will anticipate that those will be used to offset some of that wage inflation. Jamere, you want to talk about LIFO?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So as I mentioned, we were up 56 basis points and 42 basis points of that was a LIFO tailwind. The remaining margin was driven by, as I said, merchandising margin actions, which more than offset the natural mix drag that we had from commercial. So as we continue to see those freight costs abate, we'll see those gains come back through to the P&L. And then as Bill said, what that means for us going forward is all of the things that we're working on in terms of merchandise margin actions will actually be accretive to the business, if you will, and we'll get back to our normal state of running the margin intensity playbook that we've run in the past. So, we feel pretty good about that. We've seen some inflation cool off in the supply chain. But as Bill said, the stickiest portion of that are wages and wages, we don't anticipate going down. So, there'll still be some cost pressures there. But it's good to actually be in a position to have some deflationary conversations, now versus where we were when we were in the heart of the pandemic when quite frankly, everything was moving with red arrows in terms of inflation. So, we think we have some opportunity there, and that should give us some margin tailwind as we move forward.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks very much. Have a great rest of spring.\nJamere Jackson: Yes, you too.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, good morning, everyone. Kind of a follow-up to the prior question. I wanted to ask what the commercial run rate looks like. It's going through some normalization. You both have said double-digit. I assume that's comp, not just total sales? And that's going to be at least two-x what the industry grows at in theory, if we take the historic run rate. So why is that, call it, high single, even low double why shouldn't that be the normalized run rate? Or - how else are you thinking about it, yes, so I'll leave it at that?\nBill Rhodes: First of all, you said same-store I don't think we said same-store maybe Jamere did in his remarks. I just think, Simeon, we've got less than a 5% market share. We have over 15% in the retail business. We have a very fragmented industry in commercial with some competitors that, frankly, don't have a lot of the strengths that we have. I would anticipate us to grow meaningfully ahead of the market. And the market over long periods of time, you know DIFM is running 4%, 4.5%. So we - to me, growing double that, seems like it makes sense. Frankly, we didn't do it this quarter. We've got some work to do to reaccelerate our growth, but we also were celebrating some 25% and 27% growth over this period of time. The other thing that Jamere worked on is, we're not sitting here and sitting on our hands either. We're also working on - what are, the next generation of initiatives that we're going to deploy to make us provide better customer service for our commercial customers and be a better partner with them. I'm excited about some of the things that we're working on. They're not even in test yet. And as you know, we will go off and test them. But we're committed not to a quarter's growth rate in commercial. We're committed to being the largest player in the commercial business over the long run.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And my follow-up is, are you seeing anything with regard to price in terms of competitive posture? Is anything visible on the street? And then thinking about it yourself I know we talked about not engaging in it again, but it seems like the industry could go through another nice wave here with credit crunch and continued aging of the vehicle population?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, great question. Yes. Have we seen things in the pricing environment in the commercial sector different than before? The answer is absolutely yes. One of our competitors well-advertised that they had changed their pricing posture. But I want to back up and I want to remind everybody, we did something similar about two years ago. And when we did it, first of all, we had tested it in six markets and then 14 markets before we rolled it to the other 40 some odd markets. We knew what was going to work. And it had nothing to do with our pricing posture versus our close-end competitors. It had everything to do with trying to optimize our value proposition versus the warehouse distributors who hold the vast majority of share in this industry. As we've seen a competitor move their pricing, we see no indications that, that competitor has - is lower than us on pricing. I think that they seem to have reduced that gap similar to what we did. We don't have perfect visibility to it, but that's what we're seeing at this point in time.\nJamere Jackson: And the other thing I'll remind you, just in terms of our initiatives, pricing was a leg of the stool, if you will. And pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. And what we've always said is we're going to be priced right in the marketplace. So if indeed, there was some action there that suggested we needed to go to something, we would certainly do that to continue on this journey, as Bill mentioned before, of growing our market share and growing our gross margin dollars. That's been a winning playbook for us.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you both.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you Simeon.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hi, good morning, and thank you. Is there a way to size up the impact of internal factors versus external factors on the comp this quarter? And as you think about all the moving parts around tax refunds and weather and perhaps some deferred maintenance from a gradually slowing consumer, to what extent do you view these Q3 headwinds as a one-off or transitory versus the beginning of perhaps a bigger change in trend for the industry?\nBill Rhodes: I don't necessarily know that the industry changed. We'll have to see as we get more visibility to what happened across the industry. Certainly, our results changed. I can't go through and parse it piece-by-piece clearly, the weather implications from March or an anomaly that should not repeat themselves. I don't anticipate in the summer-time, they're using not a lot of weather impacts in the summer or fall. They generally have more pronounced in winter and spring, when the weather is more volatile. I think some of these internal things that we're talking about, as I said a minute ago, they're going to take us a little time, because we can start doing the processes again. But the ramifications and the outcomes that come along with those processes and as I said, they're going to take months, but we'll get there. Again, we're playing for the long game.\nZach Fadem: Got you. And then on your SG&A per store, it stepped back down to that 2.5% range. To what extent was this planned versus a pivot from slowing sales? And then as we look forward, is it fair to say that we've now returned to a more normalized lower single-digit run rate from here or would you expect it to step back up as sales perhaps recover?\nJamere Jackson: Well, I think what we've said historically is we've been very disciplined on SG&A growth, and we've grown SG&A sort of in line with the top line. And you saw this quarter that as sales were a little bit lighter, we were able to deliver upon that. But what I'll also reiterate is that we're going to invest in SG&A in a disciplined way for the things that we need to do to create a faster growing business. One of the areas that I've talked about in the past is the investments that we're making in IT, for example, to improve our speed, to improve our productivity, to improve the way that we're doing business in our stores and improve the experience that our customers have with us. And so to the extent that we need to lean in and invest a little bit more in SG&A to deliver upon that, we will. But this is a business that has been very, very disciplined about managing the SG&A line. And when we need to manage it to deliver a certain result, we'll do that, but we're not going to do that at the expense of our growth initiatives.\nZach Fadem: Got it, appreciate the time guys.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you, Zach.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Steven, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning.\nSteven Forbes: I wanted to focus on the domestic Mega-hub initiative. So can you first just confirm the year-end target? I think you said '22 to '25 new Mega-hubs versus seven year-to-date. But I just want confirmation on that? And then, can you speak to any bottlenecks or limitations that would potentially prevent a more accelerated ramp in 2024 and beyond or just any comment on how the Mega-hub real estate pipeline looks today?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, we've talked about our growth initiatives still having a lot of runways. And quite frankly, the Mega-hub is one of those. Candidly, Bill talked about execution. We would like to open more, and we would like to open them sooner. And this is a matter of execution versus a macro or competitive issue. So we've got a big quarter plan for Q4. And the teams are working on all the things that we need to work on from site identification to streamlining our processes to get more open faster. But this very clearly is an execution point. I want store development inside our company. And when we talk about places where we need to exit pandemic mode and have better execution, this is certainly one of them.\nSteven Forbes: And then maybe just a follow-up, staying on the footprint opportunities, you talked about international, but curious maybe if you could expand on how you sort of expect the footprint in both Brazil and Mexico to grow over the coming years? And then you also mentioned ROIC, so curious if you could just update us on how the return profile of the international location compares to the company average today?\nBill Rhodes: Sure. So in Mexico, excluding the pandemic, we've opened 40 stores a year for a very long period of time. We didn't open as many in the pandemic. Our team down there owes us a few of those openings. So hopefully, we will grow at a little bit faster rate on a store count basis in Mexico going forward. A little over a year ago, we defined our test in Brazil as over and made Brazil a part of our ongoing strategic growth plan. And so, they are now moving forward very rapidly. We're going to open 20 some odd stores this fiscal year and hopefully, we'll grow from there. So, it will become a bigger and bigger part of our organic - sorry, of our organic growth. On Brazil, the ROIC is negative. We've said it several times as - until we get to scale, some level of scale, we are continuing to lose money in Brazil because of the overhead infrastructure and warehouse and delivery infrastructure. We clearly see - a line of sight to profitability, and we see a line of sight to good returns. In Mexico, our returns are better than they are in the United States. It's been a very good performing market for us for 25 years now. And the most exciting part is as we get further and further in the growth spectrum, we see more and more growth in front of us in Mexico. So, we don't see any slowing down anytime soon.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Scot, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. It makes sense that some of these execution issues can't be fixed in days or weeks, but it would also imply that they've been going on for a while. So I guess my question is like why would the slowdown show up so starkly this quarter? I guess I would have expected more of a trend line rather than a step function change in, let's call it stack growth trends? Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: I think it's a fair question. And I want to be careful and not to say that all of this was due to those processes. I think that that's an element. We talked about weather. And there's, other things that are happening in the marketplace. So, I don't want to pin at all on that. And you're right. Those things have been going on for probably a year to two years. They're just going to take some - it's not putting those processes back in place. It's going to change it. It's the outcomes that come along with those processes weeks and months later.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. And I think what you're hearing from our tone here is that, number one, we believe that the industry is healthy, and they're very healthy industry dynamics. Number two, we're continuing to grow share, but we have set a very ambitious goal to grow our business faster, particularly in commercial, where we said our business should grow double-digits. And as we look at the path forward, while we don't see an immediate snap back to that potentially. We think all the growth initiatives that we have in place, all the new things that we have in flight, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to go do that. So these are not things to Bill's point, where we're saying - we're pinning everything on some macro issue or pinning everything on execution. But we control our own destiny and the things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, are things that will help us drive better performance as we move forward.\nBill Rhodes: And the only thing I'd add further, we're playing the long game. Yes, we're disappointed with a 6% growth. That's not going to deter us. With in fact it makes us hungrier and work harder, so we're looking at this over the very long-term.\nScot Ciccarelli: That's helpful. And then just a quickie, hopefully, how big of a sales gap in sales performance did you see in different markets that may help us better kind of gauge the impact of weather in the quarter? Thanks guys.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I mean, we saw mixed results. We talked a little bit about - the comments about the Northeast and the Midwest that clearly where we underperformed and those are markets that, quite frankly, if we get some decent weather here over the next quarter or so, we could see that rebound and produce a better result. But those are probably two areas regionally where we saw slightly lower performance than we saw across the rest of the chain.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning, thank you all for taking my question. So Rhodes, your commercial business decelerated at the same time there was a meaningful acceleration in the performance of the commercial businesses of one of your peers. What does that tell you about structural limitation in terms of your commercial business's ability to gain market share?\nBill Rhodes: It's an interesting way to put it, Michael. Yes, I'll be crystal clear. That is not lost on us what you just pointed out. I'll also point out that, as I mentioned in the pricing discussion, they embarked on a - pivot in their strategy a little over a year ago and not dissimilar to what happened to us two years ago was they changed their competitiveness versus other sets of customers - competitors in the marketplace. And obviously, that strategy has worked. And it - so happened to coincide with the slowdown for us. I don't necessarily pin those two things together.\nJamere Jackson: From my vantage point, Michael, I mean, again, as we've said before, they grew share, and those results were very impressive, but we also grew share as well. And our focus, again, is on how do we grow faster and win even larger shares than what we've grown over the past quarter or so. And that focus hasn't changed.\nMichael Lasser: And a follow-up on your prior statement, Jamere, in order to get back to the double-digit growth for your commercial business, does that mean even to see an improvement in sales per existing customers or an increase in your total customer count to get to that level?\nJamere Jackson: Well, we clearly, as we've talked about, we're a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. So - and that opportunity for us is to grow our share of wallet with our existing customers. And it's also to grow new business both in national and with locals are up and down the street as we affectionately call them in-house. And we believe that opportunity is still in front of us. So, as we look at our commercial business going forward, what gives us a tremendous amount of confidence, the things that we put in place have worked. We know that we have some things that are in flight today that are very, very promising that we're launching in Q4 and over the next year or so. And we think those things are going to pay dividends for us as well, but it's clearly an opportunity for us to go deeper in the wallets of our existing customers and grow new customers at the same time.\nMichael Lasser: Thanks very much.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Bellinger from ROTH MKM. David, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bellinger: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So if we look back at this quarter, 3% comp in February, close to 4% in April and May as you move past some of these weather and tax refund fluctuations. So is that a good sustainable run rate to think about for comp sales growth from here and as you hold on to price and continue to make these underlying investments in the business?\nBill Rhodes: As you know, David, we \"don't give guidance\" but we pointed out and called out March as the anomaly. So your supposition is generally in line with that thinking.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. And then - just a follow-up on your prepared remarks, you talked about the sales floor and some discretionary categories, believe improving, I believe, is what you said. So that seems that odds with some of the other retailer comments out there. So anything to read into that, is there more of a trade-down benefit behind it? And maybe a positive for those types of categories, if we see more indications of just a broader spending slowdown, just how do you think about those specific categories?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. If you recall, the categories that I called out were not necessarily discretionary. They're sales floor categories, but batteries, oil and wipers, none of those are discretionary. I don't think we've seen a big rebound in our discretionary business, except we've seen it a little bit improved at times as we've gotten back into in-stock. Those are some places we didn't have the in-stock levels that we would have liked. But generally, the places where we've seen the sales floor recover were more maintenance-oriented categories.\nDavid Bellinger: Great, thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. My first question is on inflation. Thanks for giving us the ticket up 4% and traffic down 2% for the company. Was it fair to say that inflation might be up six and that the difference might be items of basket or trade down or mix if we look at average ticket?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, that's the right ZIP code. We saw inflation up kind of in the mid-single digit-ish range, if you will. And then there's, always things in the basket and mix that can cause you to have a slightly different ticket print than that.\nBill Rhodes: Greg, I'd also like to remind you that historically for a long time, this industry has a trajectory that has pressure on customer count and growth in average ticket, because of the technological innovations that are happening in components on a vehicle. So, we've seen our ticket growth 3%, 3.5%, 4% basically since I've been in this business with generally a drag on transaction counts. So the gap between where we are today and where we are historically is closed considerably.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then my second question is, you went through weather and geographies. Is there any difference on how the more urban or densely populated stores are performing versus rural? I'm just thinking that's one thing we've seen from de-densification over COVID and with shrink, particularly impacting some retailers, a lot of retailers.\nBill Rhodes: I think shrink would be a different story than sales. We don't see any big significant difference in our sales trajectory in rural versus urban environments. Clearly, it's a tough environment out there on the shrink front. Our team is managing shrink okay. We have some trends that are a little bit worse than what they have been, and we're focused on that. But as you know, a lot of retailers are talking about organized retail crime and it's a real problem. Fortunately for us, there are a lot of times focused on more consumable items, which are not necessarily available in an AutoZone store.\nGreg Melich: And in certain areas, you haven't like chain store hours to sort of either protect employees or anything you have to go to that extreme?\nBill Rhodes: Absolutely not, no we do put guards in certain stores to make sure that we do control the environment.\nGreg Melich: Right thanks, and good luck.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning is coming from Steven Zaccone from Citi. Steven, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSteven Zaccone: Great, good morning, everyone thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on pricing. If we think about mid-single digits in the third quarter, what will it be in the fourth quarter? And as we look to next year, would you still expect it to be a slight tailwind to comps or could it, in fact, be flattish?\nJamere Jackson: We expect the fourth quarter to be generally in the same ZIP code as what we saw in Q3. And then as we look to next year, there are several things that are at play here. But the ones that I think you ought to spend the most time thinking about as you're looking to correlate that to what you see in pricing is what we've talked about in the wage environment where wages are still stubbornly high. Let's call it, in the 4% to 5%-ish kind of ZIP code. And I think that sort of translates to at a minimum, what you see - you ought to see from a pricing environment. And there are puts and takes, obviously, from pricing. As Bill mentioned, there will be some categories where we'll see some deflation, some that will see some inflation. But generally speaking, we're fading more to the historical norms than we have in the past.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay, great, thank you. And then I hate to go back to commercial, but I did want to clarify something and just given your commentary about some of these internal factors, is it fair to think the time line to return to double-digit commercial growth may take a couple quarters? Anything you can say on the time line would be helpful for us as we assess our models?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, I think we'll stick with what we've already said. This is not going to turn around in the weeks. It's going to take months. Is that four? Is that eight? I don't know until we get into it.\nSteven Zaccone: Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yes, thank you very much. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry, and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us continue to succeed, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should all remember our countries, heroes both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you once again for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to providing our customers with WOW! Customer Service, which has been the secret to our long-term, consistent success. For the third quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 5.8%, which included a 1.9% domestic same store sales comp. While our topline results were below our expectations at the start of the quarter, our sales improved later in the quarter as we experienced improved weather. We were pleased to deliver operating profit growth north of 9% and EPS growth of 17.5%. Both our operating profit and EPS growth were the highest growth rates we've had in over a year. As many retailers have reported, March was a tough month, as cool, wet weather impacted customer traffic. In addition, snow accumulations were down significantly in February and March for much of the country, which also had some impact on our business. We mentioned in our last call that weather, particularly during tax refund season, really matters. Unfortunately, it was unfavorable this year, as our results reflect. We also, after rapid growth and extensive market share gains in commercial, experienced some headwinds this quarter and our growth was disappointing to us. We were lapping tremendous growth last year and had some internal and external factors that impacted our growth this quarter. We have had some sectors of this business that had been extremely challenged with rising interest rates and high used car prices. Additionally, during our rapid growth over the last couple of years, we also unintentionally de-emphasized some of our tried and true disciplines. As I've said for the last six months or so, as we exit pandemic mode, we must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution, which I believe will help us reignite topline growth. We have good initiatives in flight in both our retail and commercial businesses, and we are determined to move with urgency to reaccelerate our sales and share growth. Fortunately, as this difference between our domestic same store sales growth and our total sales growth implies, our international team, particularly in Mexico, delivered very strong sales growth for the quarter. Our teams in Mexico and Brazil continue to do a great job, offering differentiated customer experiences, which is leading to strong sales growth. This morning, we will review our third quarter same store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional callouts. We'll also share how inflation is, in fact, impacting our cost in retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY '23. Moving to the specifics for the quarter, domestic same store sales were up 1.9%; our net income was $648 million; and our earnings per share was $34.12, increasing 17.5%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 4.5% domestic same store sales comp; and on a three-year basis, a 33.4% stacked comp. Our three-year stacked comp was in line with what we've seen in the last three quarters. Domestic retail sales were up 2.2%, and our domestic commercial growth was 6.3%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records, with $1.11 billion in sales, as we generated an additional $66 million in sales than in Q3 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered $4.54 billion in annual commercial sales, up a strong 14.4% over last year. We also set another Q3 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,800. As I've mentioned earlier, March was a bit of an outlier in the quarter's domestic sales results. We had a greater than 3% comp in February, but fell to a negative 1% in March, before recovering back to just under 4% in April and early May. On a regional basis, we experienced slower growth in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets than the rest of the country. This held true for both our DIY and commercial businesses. Our business on the West Coast was in line with our remaining markets. Average ticket grew 4% in retail and commercial for the quarter, decreasing 1% from last year. After the most significant product cost inflation we have seen in decades, we are seeing those trends moderate and are negotiating some cost reductions from our vendors, as both product cost and freight inflation are slowing or have subsided. Additionally, while not anywhere close to historical norms, we saw wage inflation moderate to approximately 4%. While the staffing environment has substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation pulling back much from these levels, as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we've had to manage through external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives did just that this past quarter and included new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. While our sales moderated this past quarter, we remain focused on growing our share over time and becoming the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this quarter, we delivered a 0.6% comp. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 4% versus last year and our transaction count trends were down 3%. From the data we have available, we continued to gain both dollar and unit share during the quarter. Our sales floor outperformed hard parts, with approximately a 3% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales floor categories is attributable to both discretionary categories improving and the hard parts categories slowing. It was encouraging to see our sales floor items performing so well. Specifically, batteries, oil, and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this summer, as we expect miles driven improvements, while our growth initiatives continue delivering strong results. Let me also address our pricing strategies. In Q3, we continued experiencing mid-single digit pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the fourth quarter, as we are lapping the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. We remain excited about our growth initiatives, our team's focus on execution, and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both our retail and commercial businesses over the last few years. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by our commercial business, as we execute on opening additional hub and mega hub stores, have an improving in-stock position, and improve customer service. We also believe our DIY business will remain resilient, as the difficult macro environment is pointing customers to continue maintaining their vehicles. We will, as always, be transparent about what we're seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to reiterate our plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil, with almost 800 stores combined across these two markets. As previously noted, these businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be successful. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this past quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2023. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first are what define us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. This upcoming quarter will be very busy for us. We'll be opening over 100 stores in the Americas. We'll also remain focused on those initiatives that we have underway to grow sales in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned previously, we are doubling down on execution and are focused on driving share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Hi Bret. Yes, it's a great question, Bret. Thank you for it - yes, I would - I want to make - be very careful how I say this. We unintentionally deemphasize some of the processes and procedures that we have in place, and that's not to be surprising. During the pandemic, we had to do a lot of things differently. And also in the commercial business, in particular, we were growing very, very rapidly. And we just got away from some of the process, procedures that we have in place. And we are going back to those and reemphasizing those. But to your point, that's not going to turn around in a day. It's going to turn around in months, not days or weeks. And we're working very diligently on it today. But - it's some simple things like periodic - how are we deploying our sales force, what our national account focus is? And just things like that, that we have very disciplined processes that just in the midst of the pandemic, we kind of turned our back on a little bit. I think that's a great question, too, Bret. And you're exactly right. We've seen it in the past. The one-time that's different this year is, we did have winter in December. So in 2017, we never had a winter. I also talked about that our brakes category has been a little bit softer. That can be a place where we see some lingering effects. I don't think it's going to be anywhere on the order of magnitude of what we saw in '17, but it might be a little bit softer. Thank you. Good morning. Chris, I'm going to let Jamere answer that second part if you don't mind. It was his statement. I think he's ready for that, too and I am as well. I think - the businesses trended very similarly. I think one of the things that I also pointed out, it was not just that the weather was poor. The weather hit us at the worst time of the year for us during the all-important tax refund season. You all have seen tax refunds were down a little bit this year. But to us, the bigger implication was the weather was just pretty awful. It was cold and wet and mild during that period of time. And so, we saw both businesses trend down and they both have improved at some level, like I called out in the prepared remarks. Jamere? I don't think anything has changed in our commitment. We need to be a double-digit grower in commercial. And we weren't this quarter. Yes, I'll take the first part and turn it back to Jamere to talk about LIFO. As far as - first of all, we have not seen meaningful reductions in product costs at this point in time. We have seen meaningful reductions in freight cost. But if you recall, we did not even attempt to pass on all the freight costs to our customers, because we knew it was somewhat of an anomaly, and would reverse course at some order of magnitude. So as we are beginning to see some product costs reductions, I don't anticipate that we will reduce pricing as a result of those. And for one really strong reason, our wage inflation has been more than double what we've experienced in my 28 years here. We have to somehow get paid for that wage inflation, too, in the P&L. And so, if we get some reduction in product costs, I will anticipate that those will be used to offset some of that wage inflation. Jamere, you want to talk about LIFO? First of all, you said same-store I don't think we said same-store maybe Jamere did in his remarks. I just think, Simeon, we've got less than a 5% market share. We have over 15% in the retail business. We have a very fragmented industry in commercial with some competitors that, frankly, don't have a lot of the strengths that we have. I would anticipate us to grow meaningfully ahead of the market. And the market over long periods of time, you know DIFM is running 4%, 4.5%. So we - to me, growing double that, seems like it makes sense. Frankly, we didn't do it this quarter. We've got some work to do to reaccelerate our growth, but we also were celebrating some 25% and 27% growth over this period of time. The other thing that Jamere worked on is, we're not sitting here and sitting on our hands either. We're also working on - what are, the next generation of initiatives that we're going to deploy to make us provide better customer service for our commercial customers and be a better partner with them. I'm excited about some of the things that we're working on. They're not even in test yet. And as you know, we will go off and test them. But we're committed not to a quarter's growth rate in commercial. We're committed to being the largest player in the commercial business over the long run. Yes, great question. Yes. Have we seen things in the pricing environment in the commercial sector different than before? The answer is absolutely yes. One of our competitors well-advertised that they had changed their pricing posture. But I want to back up and I want to remind everybody, we did something similar about two years ago. And when we did it, first of all, we had tested it in six markets and then 14 markets before we rolled it to the other 40 some odd markets. We knew what was going to work. And it had nothing to do with our pricing posture versus our close-end competitors. It had everything to do with trying to optimize our value proposition versus the warehouse distributors who hold the vast majority of share in this industry. As we've seen a competitor move their pricing, we see no indications that, that competitor has - is lower than us on pricing. I think that they seem to have reduced that gap similar to what we did. We don't have perfect visibility to it, but that's what we're seeing at this point in time. Yes, thank you Simeon. I don't necessarily know that the industry changed. We'll have to see as we get more visibility to what happened across the industry. Certainly, our results changed. I can't go through and parse it piece-by-piece clearly, the weather implications from March or an anomaly that should not repeat themselves. I don't anticipate in the summer-time, they're using not a lot of weather impacts in the summer or fall. They generally have more pronounced in winter and spring, when the weather is more volatile. I think some of these internal things that we're talking about, as I said a minute ago, they're going to take us a little time, because we can start doing the processes again. But the ramifications and the outcomes that come along with those processes and as I said, they're going to take months, but we'll get there. Again, we're playing for the long game. Yes, thank you, Zach. Good morning. Sure. So in Mexico, excluding the pandemic, we've opened 40 stores a year for a very long period of time. We didn't open as many in the pandemic. Our team down there owes us a few of those openings. So hopefully, we will grow at a little bit faster rate on a store count basis in Mexico going forward. A little over a year ago, we defined our test in Brazil as over and made Brazil a part of our ongoing strategic growth plan. And so, they are now moving forward very rapidly. We're going to open 20 some odd stores this fiscal year and hopefully, we'll grow from there. So, it will become a bigger and bigger part of our organic - sorry, of our organic growth. On Brazil, the ROIC is negative. We've said it several times as - until we get to scale, some level of scale, we are continuing to lose money in Brazil because of the overhead infrastructure and warehouse and delivery infrastructure. We clearly see - a line of sight to profitability, and we see a line of sight to good returns. In Mexico, our returns are better than they are in the United States. It's been a very good performing market for us for 25 years now. And the most exciting part is as we get further and further in the growth spectrum, we see more and more growth in front of us in Mexico. So, we don't see any slowing down anytime soon. Yes, thank you. I think it's a fair question. And I want to be careful and not to say that all of this was due to those processes. I think that that's an element. We talked about weather. And there's, other things that are happening in the marketplace. So, I don't want to pin at all on that. And you're right. Those things have been going on for probably a year to two years. They're just going to take some - it's not putting those processes back in place. It's going to change it. It's the outcomes that come along with those processes weeks and months later. And the only thing I'd add further, we're playing the long game. Yes, we're disappointed with a 6% growth. That's not going to deter us. With in fact it makes us hungrier and work harder, so we're looking at this over the very long-term. Thank you. It's an interesting way to put it, Michael. Yes, I'll be crystal clear. That is not lost on us what you just pointed out. I'll also point out that, as I mentioned in the pricing discussion, they embarked on a - pivot in their strategy a little over a year ago and not dissimilar to what happened to us two years ago was they changed their competitiveness versus other sets of customers - competitors in the marketplace. And obviously, that strategy has worked. And it - so happened to coincide with the slowdown for us. I don't necessarily pin those two things together. Thank you. As you know, David, we \"don't give guidance\" but we pointed out and called out March as the anomaly. So your supposition is generally in line with that thinking. Yes. If you recall, the categories that I called out were not necessarily discretionary. They're sales floor categories, but batteries, oil and wipers, none of those are discretionary. I don't think we've seen a big rebound in our discretionary business, except we've seen it a little bit improved at times as we've gotten back into in-stock. Those are some places we didn't have the in-stock levels that we would have liked. But generally, the places where we've seen the sales floor recover were more maintenance-oriented categories. Yes, thank you. Greg, I'd also like to remind you that historically for a long time, this industry has a trajectory that has pressure on customer count and growth in average ticket, because of the technological innovations that are happening in components on a vehicle. So, we've seen our ticket growth 3%, 3.5%, 4% basically since I've been in this business with generally a drag on transaction counts. So the gap between where we are today and where we are historically is closed considerably. I think shrink would be a different story than sales. We don't see any big significant difference in our sales trajectory in rural versus urban environments. Clearly, it's a tough environment out there on the shrink front. Our team is managing shrink okay. We have some trends that are a little bit worse than what they have been, and we're focused on that. But as you know, a lot of retailers are talking about organized retail crime and it's a real problem. Fortunately for us, there are a lot of times focused on more consumable items, which are not necessarily available in an AutoZone store. Absolutely not, no we do put guards in certain stores to make sure that we do control the environment. Yes, thank you. Yes, I think we'll stick with what we've already said. This is not going to turn around in the weeks. It's going to take months. Is that four? Is that eight? I don't know until we get into it. Yes, thank you very much. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry, and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us continue to succeed, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should all remember our countries, heroes both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had solid results for our third quarter. This quarter, we delivered a 1.9% domestic comp growth, a 9.3% increase in EBIT, and a 17.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4.1 billion, up 5.8%, reflecting continued strength in our industry, solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 6.3% to just over $1.1 billion and were up just over 32% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,786, up 1.2%. We experienced growth across both our local customer base and national accounts, with local being the stronger of the two categories. Our results for the quarter set another record for highest weekly sales volume in the history of the chain at $92.5 million. I want to reiterate that our commercial business is strong and we believe we grew share despite a deceleration in our growth rates this quarter. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 26 net new programs, finishing with 5,526 total programs. As expected, commercial growth continues to lead the way in FY '23, and we continue to focus on growing our business faster. Our strategy remains intact, as we continue to gain share in the industry. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I'll add some color on our progress. We now have 85 mega hub locations, with four new ones opened in Q3. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was roughly $16,800, the 84 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and continued to grow significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q3. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network for both DIY and commercial. This strategy is working. We will open 22 to 25 new mega hubs in FY '23, and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. Many of you've heard me say that in the near term, our commercial business should grow double digits as far as the eye can see, and we maintain that conviction despite this quarter's results. We are significantly underpenetrated with a four to five share in an addressable market that is approaching $100 billion. The investments that we have made in our Duralast brand, expanding our coverage and assortment, adding more hubs and mega hubs, building technologies and improving our customer service continue to pay significant dividends and have a long runway. Nothing has changed in our views on what we can accomplish going forward, although we still have work to do to get back to this performance. Moving to our domestic retail business, we delivered a 0.6% comp in Q3. Like our domestic commercial business, retail has been resilient and we continue to grow share and deliver positive comp growth despite a dismal March. We exited the quarter much stronger and we're focused on execution in Q4. We saw a 4% ticket growth, as Bill mentioned, and we saw traffic down 3% from last year's levels. However, excluding the middle four weeks of the quarter, traffic was in line with last quarter, when we were down only 2%. This past quarter, we continued to gain unit and dollar share across the retail segment, a reflection of the relative strength of our business. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, with both the new and used car markets posing significant challenges for our customers. We expect these markets to remain challenged for a longer period of time than we originally assumed, which should be a tailwind for DIY. These dynamics, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of 2023. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened six new stores in Mexico to finish with 713 stores and two new stores in Brazil, ending with 83. On a constant currency basis, we continue to accelerate our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With just over 11% of our total store base currently outside the US and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, we are bullish on international growth and we're adding stores and supply chain capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was up 56 basis points, including a $17 million LIFO credit, which drove 42 basis points of improvement. Excluding the LIFO benefit, our gross margin increase over last year's quarter was driven by higher merchandise margins, which more than offset a drag from the commercial business mix. With this quarter's LIFO gain, we have taken our remaining LIFO balance to $89 million. And as I mentioned over the last few quarters, hyperinflation and freight cost was the primary driver for the charges we took in the P&L. Freight costs have continued to abate over the past several months, and we expect this trend to continue and drive a similar LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges that we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance, as we have done historically. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 5.5% versus last year's Q3, as SG&A levered 10 basis points versus last year. As we've said previously, we are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will continue to manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $858 million, up 9.3% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $17 million LIFO credit, EBIT would have been up 7.1% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $74.3 million, up 77% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q3-end last year. We are planning Interest expense in the $105 million area for the fourth quarter versus $64 million in last year's fourth quarter. Higher debt levels and higher borrowing rates, especially at the short end of the borrowing curve, are driving the increase in interest expense. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.4%, below last year's third quarter rate of 20.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 595 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 284 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $648 million, up 9.3% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 19 million was 7% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $34.12, up 17.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO credit, our net income would have increased 7.1% and our EPS growth would have been 15.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $554 million in free cash flow versus $682 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated just over $1.4 billion versus just over $1.6 billion a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 4.3% versus Q3 last year, and total inventory increased 7.4%, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives, and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $215,000 versus negative $216,000 last year and negative $227,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 126.5% versus last year's Q3 of 127.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $908 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter-end, we had just under $850 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet, and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 6% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.3 times EBITDAR, and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area. To wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and growing commercial and international businesses. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now, I'll turn it back to Bill. Yes. So listen, as I said in my remarks, I mean, we're still committed to being a double-digit grower over time. We're underpenetrated; we have roughly a, four to five share and that gives us an opportunity to create a faster growing business. We're executing our growth playbook and that growth playbook, quite frankly, still has a lot of runway associated with it, and we saw significant share gains over the past three years. So things like improving the quality of our parts and our Duralast offerings, expanding our assortments with Mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology, the competitive pricing that we've done, all of those things still have a lot of legs associated with them. So when I think about what Bill talked about as it relates to execution, first, we believe that we grew share in commercial despite the growth rate deceleration. And secondly, we believe that those growth initiatives still have a lot of runway. And we have other initiatives in flight, as Bill mentioned, that we'll execute in Q4 and during FY '24 that we believe will accelerate growth. So nothing's changed in our strategy. Nothing has changed in our outlook as we move forward. Yes. So as I mentioned, we were up 56 basis points and 42 basis points of that was a LIFO tailwind. The remaining margin was driven by, as I said, merchandising margin actions, which more than offset the natural mix drag that we had from commercial. So as we continue to see those freight costs abate, we'll see those gains come back through to the P&L. And then as Bill said, what that means for us going forward is all of the things that we're working on in terms of merchandise margin actions will actually be accretive to the business, if you will, and we'll get back to our normal state of running the margin intensity playbook that we've run in the past. So, we feel pretty good about that. We've seen some inflation cool off in the supply chain. But as Bill said, the stickiest portion of that are wages and wages, we don't anticipate going down. So, there'll still be some cost pressures there. But it's good to actually be in a position to have some deflationary conversations, now versus where we were when we were in the heart of the pandemic when quite frankly, everything was moving with red arrows in terms of inflation. So, we think we have some opportunity there, and that should give us some margin tailwind as we move forward. Yes, you too. And the other thing I'll remind you, just in terms of our initiatives, pricing was a leg of the stool, if you will. And pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. And what we've always said is we're going to be priced right in the marketplace. So if indeed, there was some action there that suggested we needed to go to something, we would certainly do that to continue on this journey, as Bill mentioned before, of growing our market share and growing our gross margin dollars. That's been a winning playbook for us. Well, I think what we've said historically is we've been very disciplined on SG&A growth, and we've grown SG&A sort of in line with the top line. And you saw this quarter that as sales were a little bit lighter, we were able to deliver upon that. But what I'll also reiterate is that we're going to invest in SG&A in a disciplined way for the things that we need to do to create a faster growing business. One of the areas that I've talked about in the past is the investments that we're making in IT, for example, to improve our speed, to improve our productivity, to improve the way that we're doing business in our stores and improve the experience that our customers have with us. And so to the extent that we need to lean in and invest a little bit more in SG&A to deliver upon that, we will. But this is a business that has been very, very disciplined about managing the SG&A line. And when we need to manage it to deliver a certain result, we'll do that, but we're not going to do that at the expense of our growth initiatives. Yes, we've talked about our growth initiatives still having a lot of runways. And quite frankly, the Mega-hub is one of those. Candidly, Bill talked about execution. We would like to open more, and we would like to open them sooner. And this is a matter of execution versus a macro or competitive issue. So we've got a big quarter plan for Q4. And the teams are working on all the things that we need to work on from site identification to streamlining our processes to get more open faster. But this very clearly is an execution point. I want store development inside our company. And when we talk about places where we need to exit pandemic mode and have better execution, this is certainly one of them. Yes. And I think what you're hearing from our tone here is that, number one, we believe that the industry is healthy, and they're very healthy industry dynamics. Number two, we're continuing to grow share, but we have set a very ambitious goal to grow our business faster, particularly in commercial, where we said our business should grow double-digits. And as we look at the path forward, while we don't see an immediate snap back to that potentially. We think all the growth initiatives that we have in place, all the new things that we have in flight, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to go do that. So these are not things to Bill's point, where we're saying - we're pinning everything on some macro issue or pinning everything on execution. But we control our own destiny and the things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, are things that will help us drive better performance as we move forward. Yes. I mean, we saw mixed results. We talked a little bit about - the comments about the Northeast and the Midwest that clearly where we underperformed and those are markets that, quite frankly, if we get some decent weather here over the next quarter or so, we could see that rebound and produce a better result. But those are probably two areas regionally where we saw slightly lower performance than we saw across the rest of the chain. From my vantage point, Michael, I mean, again, as we've said before, they grew share, and those results were very impressive, but we also grew share as well. And our focus, again, is on how do we grow faster and win even larger shares than what we've grown over the past quarter or so. And that focus hasn't changed. Well, we clearly, as we've talked about, we're a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. So - and that opportunity for us is to grow our share of wallet with our existing customers. And it's also to grow new business both in national and with locals are up and down the street as we affectionately call them in-house. And we believe that opportunity is still in front of us. So, as we look at our commercial business going forward, what gives us a tremendous amount of confidence, the things that we put in place have worked. We know that we have some things that are in flight today that are very, very promising that we're launching in Q4 and over the next year or so. And we think those things are going to pay dividends for us as well, but it's clearly an opportunity for us to go deeper in the wallets of our existing customers and grow new customers at the same time. Yes, that's the right ZIP code. We saw inflation up kind of in the mid-single digit-ish range, if you will. And then there's, always things in the basket and mix that can cause you to have a slightly different ticket print than that. Thank you. We expect the fourth quarter to be generally in the same ZIP code as what we saw in Q3. And then as we look to next year, there are several things that are at play here. But the ones that I think you ought to spend the most time thinking about as you're looking to correlate that to what you see in pricing is what we've talked about in the wage environment where wages are still stubbornly high. Let's call it, in the 4% to 5%-ish kind of ZIP code. And I think that sort of translates to at a minimum, what you see - you ought to see from a pricing environment. And there are puts and takes, obviously, from pricing. As Bill mentioned, there will be some categories where we'll see some deflation, some that will see some inflation. But generally speaking, we're fading more to the historical norms than we have in the past."

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we would like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 9.5% versus 8.6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance as we were up against 15.8% total sales growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. We could not have achieved these results without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Once again, our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts generated double-digit domestic commercial growth and single-digit domestic retail same-store sales growth. As we move further and further away from the societal impacts experienced as a result of the pandemic, we are very pleased with our team\u2019s ability to not only retain the tremendous growth we experienced over the last three years, but continue to grow on top of those phenomenal levels. Our team is relentlessly focused on getting back to normal or, as I call it, quote-unquote, exiting pandemic mode. We must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution. In all candor, we still aren\u2019t there yet. But we also have to reignite our innovation engine. We have some very good initiatives in development in both retail and commercial, and we have some significant improvements underway in our supply chain, as we modernize and expand it for the next decade of growth and beyond. We are halfway through our fiscal year and we are pleased with our performance so far. More encouraging, we feel good about the balance of the year and know our AutoZoners are keenly focused on delivering great service and terrific performance. This morning, we will review our second quarter same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional call-outs. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails, and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let\u2019s now move into more specifics on our performance. Domestic same-store sales were up 5.3%, our net income was $477 million and our EPS was $24.64 a share, increasing 10.5%. Our domestic same-store sales comp was on top of last year\u2019s 13.8% and in line with last quarter\u2019s 5.6% comp. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.1% comp, and get this, on a three-year basis, a 34.3% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results despite the comparison to the last couple of years being the hardest quarterly compare for the entire fiscal year. Now let me spend a few moments on growth, our growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic retail sales up nearly 5% and domestic commercial growth north of 13%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records with $955 million in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $111 million more in sales than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.5 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing 19% over last year. We also set another Q2 record for average weekly sales per store at $14,500 versus $13,500 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 28% this time last year. It was encouraging to see our transaction trends improving from last quarter. Our retail transactions meaningfully improved and were down just 2.2% for the quarter, while our commercial transactions were up mid-single digits and improving. Our average ticket in both retail and commercial experienced solid mid single-digit growth. Ticket growth decelerated from Q1 as we began to lap the acceleration in inflation we experienced this time last year. We are beginning to see signs of product cost and freight inflation slowing, and we expect to see these begin to return to historical norms over time. We are continuing to see -- to experience substantially higher wage inflation than historically in the mid single-digit range, more than double our historical experience. While the staffing environment is substantially improved versus this time last year, we don\u2019t envision wage inflation abating soon as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we have to manage through these external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives are doing just that and include, new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega-hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. Our goal remains over time to become the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us confidence as we move forward. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this past quarter, we delivered a positive 2.7% comp on top of last year\u2019s 8.4%. Our DIY results were similar to last quarter\u2019s results on a one-year and two-year basis and accelerated on a three-year basis. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 5% versus last year. We are pleased with our transaction count trends improving as we reported transactions down just 2%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison to last year. From the data we have available, we continued to retain the majority of the dollar share gains we have built during the pandemic and we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of our success. Our performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of our sales growth for the remainder of the year. As we have shared forever, our second quarter is always the most volatile sales quarter due to the holidays, their timing shifts, and more importantly, weather, specifically extreme temperatures, which all can have a tremendous impact on our weekly sales. This quarter was no different, with softer sales at the beginning of the quarter when the weather was mild and wet, followed by a large spike around Christmas with the very cold temperatures the country experienced. We exited the quarter with normalized growth rates. We do believe we had enough harsh winter weather that we won\u2019t be talking about the lingering effects of a mild winter weather or mild winter for the next several months. Our attention has now turned to tax rebate season, which historically drives enormous demand in our category. Regarding our retail merchandise categories, our sales floor outperformed hard parts with approximately a 1.5% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales for categories is attributable to the discretionary categories improvement. As gas prices naturally have come down and consumer has shown surprising resiliency, our discretionary categories performed better. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to see our battery, oil and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations for much of the quarter. However, it bounced back late and we are encouraged by our recent trends. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this spring, as we expect miles driven to continue improving, while our growth initiatives continued delivering solid results. Let me also address pricing. In Q2, we experienced high single-digit pricing inflation in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the current quarter as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. Over the last three years, we have encouraged investors to keep a keen focus on our two-year and three-year comparisons. As we return to normal, we believe our year-over-year comparisons will be more and more relevant. While it\u2019s difficult to predict sales, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team is improving execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. For our third quarter 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives, combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on our supply chain initiatives. I will start with our in-stock position. I spent several quarters talking about how we were not back to where we were pre-pandemic. I am pleased to report, we are continuing to improve and are very close to our targets. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have worked diligently and creatively to get our levels back up, and we have made enormous progress. There are still a few categories where we are not where we want to be, but we will -- we have line of sight to putting this behind us. This has taken a lot of effort by our vendor community, and I\u2019d like to publicly thank them for their tremendous efforts as well. We know this will pay future dividends. Second, our supply chain initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability are on track. One we have often highlighted is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets closer to the customer will lead to our ability to continue to say, yes, to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Additionally, we have previously announced the development of two new domestic distribution centers and additional capacity in Mexico. All three efforts are under construction and are expected to be completed by early fiscal 2025. These distribution centers will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores but also increase our capacity. With the tremendous sales growth we have experienced since 2020, the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I am excited that -- I am also excited we opened a facility on the West Coast recently to handle direct import product on a timelier and more effective and efficient basis. This new West Coast facility is already paying dividends by allowing products ordered abroad to be distributed to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent sales success, especially in commercial. Simply put, every time we intelligently add inventory to our network our sales grow. Lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil at almost 800 stores combined across the two markets. These businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future, and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be very successful. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter stacked on top of exceptionally strong comps from last year. This quarter we delivered 5.3% domestic comp growth, a 6.9% increase in EBIT and a 10.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.7 billion, up 9.5%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives and let me give a little more color on those growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased just over 13% to $955 million and were up just over 45% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $14,500, up 7.4% and our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest second quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results, as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 41 net new programs, finishing with 5,500 total programs. As expected, commercial growth is leading the way in FY 2023 and we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. We have delivered double-digit sales growth for the past 10 quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I will add some color on our progress. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 81 mega-hub locations with one new one opened in Q2. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $14,500, the 81 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and grew significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q2. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs and more in certain cases and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parks and lifting the entire network. This strategy is working. We are targeting 25 new mega-hubs for FY 2023 and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega-hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers and improving our delivery times. We will build on our strong momentum over the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic retail comp was up 2.7% in Q2. This business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates remain solid and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw our traffic down 2.2% from last year\u2019s levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q1 where traffic was down 4%. We also saw 5% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, and a still challenging new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year\u2019s stimulus injection and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of FY 2023. Now I will say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico to finish with 707 stores and five new stores in Brazil ending with 81. On a constant currency basis, we meaningfully accelerated our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. We are bullish on international growth, and as Bill mentioned earlier, we are adding distribution center capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning in the market. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 69 basis points and included a 27-basis-point headwind stemming from a noncash $10 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 42 basis points in gross margin was driven by supply chain costs and our faster growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter\u2019s LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $106 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight cost is the primary driver for the charges. Both the first quarter and second quarter actuals are below the outlook we gave at the start of each quarter as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months and we expect this trend to continue. As such, we anticipate having minimal if any LIFO charges during the third quarter. As spot rates have come down, we have renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate. We expect to see these quarterly charges start to reverse during FY 2024, and quite possibly, as early as Q4. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance as we have done historically. Now moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.8% versus last year\u2019s Q2 as SG&A levered 24 basis points versus last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $670 million, up 6.9% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Excluding the $10 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 8.5% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 54.5% from Q2 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7 billion versus $5.8 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $72 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. Higher debt levels and expected continuing higher borrowing costs are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.2% and above last year\u2019s second quarter rate of 19.3%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 222 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year\u2019s benefit was 401 basis points. For the third quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Now moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $476.5 million, up 1% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.3 million was 8.6% lower than last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $24.64, up 10.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 2.6% and our EPS growth would have increased 12.3%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $210 million in free cash flow versus $260 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we have generated $900 million versus $930 million a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q2 last year and total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $227,000 versus negative $198,000 last year and negative $249,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 127.7% versus last year\u2019s Q2 of 126.8%. Lastly, I will spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased 906 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end, we had just under $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 4% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.3 times EBITDAR and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area during FY 2023. So to wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are growing our market share, and we are improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the back half of FY 2023, we are bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now I will turn it back to Bill.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered in the second quarter. But we must, we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. This year not only we would be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we will be opening many more mega-hub and hub stores, and we are focused on initiatives to continue driving strong performance in both our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. We remain focused on achieving our store opening goals, both domestically and internationally. We are working diligently to expand and enhance our supply chain and we have to achieve this growth, all while managing our costs appropriately. Simply said, we have to focus on exceptional execution in order to drive continued share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to four years from now and we welcome and accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone, which is led by AutoZoners. Now we would like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bret Jordan at Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning, Bret.\nJamere Jackson: Hi, Bret.\nBret Jordan: On the talk of lower transportation, supply chain costs but higher wage inflation, in this environment, where some of your inputs are going to come down and maybe you have got the opportunity to capture margin as customer prices stay firm, are we less likely to see this over for excess margin, because we have got either price investment from peers or wage inflation that might offset some of the cost of good benefit?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. It\u2019s a fantastic question, Bret. I will start, and Jamere, you are welcome to build on it if you want to. First of all, I think, it\u2019s important for you all to understand, as we saw these enormous spikes in the freight cost, we did not pass all those costs along. I will use brake rotors, for instance. I mean the cost of shipping brake rotors from China to the U.S. were astronomical for a period of time. We couldn\u2019t pass all that costs on to the industry. So some of this is we will recoup some gross margin percentages that we didn\u2019t get in the midst of the freight issue. As we look forward, I think, you have to separate the gross margin piece from the labor piece. We are going to continue to see elevated wage growth. We have seen it now for probably five years, Bret. We will continue to monitor that. Our pricing is really more focused on what our product costs are and what those freight costs are. We will be mindful of labor costs. But generally, that\u2019s not a big driver of what we do with our pricing to the customer. What we need to do is make sure that we are finding ways to be as efficient as possible with the labor that we have, and over time, I think, wage rates will go back to more normalized growth rates.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. And we haven\u2019t seen the moves and actions by our nearing competitors impact our business, really at all. Most of those moves, quite frankly, were targeted in much the same manner as our moves were a couple of years ago, which was how do we all improve our competitive hand relative to the warehouse distributors. So we haven\u2019t seen much of an impact there, and as a result of that, we don\u2019t see a need to make pricing actions to sort of counter what\u2019s being done in the marketplace by some of our newer competitors.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. And then a quick question on ALLDATA. I think you would mentioned expanding the user base. Is there a way to make that a product selling tool as they use your shop management software, is there a way to link it to your inventory or make it more transactional?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. First of all, at ALLDATA, we are very focused on providing value via our ALLDATA offerings to our customers at ALLDATA. We also look for ways that we can enhance our commercial relationship at AutoZone with their customers. We have done a lot of that by cross-selling, leveraging our two sales teams to generate leads for each other. So far, we haven\u2019t really integrated a lot with the, call it, up and down the street customer, but we have made some really meaningful progress with some of our national accounts and have some exciting things underway right now that helps integrate us more and more with them. Over time, that\u2019s certainly the vision that we have, is how can we be on their desktop as both ALLDATA and AutoZone in a seamless way, but we got to make sure that we don\u2019t drive the customer to that, that instead we have a product offering that the customer wants to adopt.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Seth Sigman at Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, everybody. Good morning. My first question is just around the improvement in transactions or ticket count. I guess that coincides with less average ticket growth. But, Bill, to your point, there really shouldn\u2019t be a lot of elasticity in this business since it\u2019s more need based, right? So is there something else that you would point to that\u2019s driving that acceleration in transactions? Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: It\u2019s a great question. Frankly, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you. As you know, you have been following this industry for a long time, one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that for decades and basically for the 28 years that I have been in this business, there has been transaction count declines and they have gone down over time, because the technology that has gone into the parts and products that we sell have increased, and therefore, the price of those products have increased. I often used the example of spark plugs. When I got in this business, we only sold copper clad spark bugs and they were $0.59 and they would last 30,000 miles. Today we sell Iridium spark plugs, it costs $11.99 and they will last 100,000 miles. There\u2019s many, many, many examples like that, 2.2% decline in retail transaction counts is historically very good. I just -- I would caution everybody, as I have mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q2 is our most volatile quarter every year and it is really driven by weather patterns. And so I don\u2019t want to read too much into an improvement in Q2, we were very excited to see it. Let\u2019s see how we do in Q2 and Q3. We are also still going up against the massive surge in growth that we had since 2019 as a result of COVID. So what we are focused on is, we thought for a period of time, that some of the sales growth that we experienced during COVID, we would give back. We are sitting here and have been for the last year saying, I don\u2019t think we are going to give it back, and now we are saying, look, we think we can grow from here and maybe have normalized growth rates and maybe even accelerated slightly growth rates to what we experienced historically, because of our growth initiatives. That\u2019s the way we are thinking about it. Does that make sense?\nSeth Sigman: Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe just one follow-up is on the cost side. You did discuss some external cost pressures. I think you are probably referring to wages and some of your competitors have also talked about wage investments. I guess when we look at your SG&A growth up high-single digits, is it fair to assume that, that already reflects AutoZone investing in its people, investing in its infrastructure, does that already reflect some of those cost pressures that you are referring to?\nJamere Jackson: Certainly does. I mean one of the things that we have been really clear about is that we are going to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster growing business and the two ways that we have done that. One, is investing in labor to maintain high levels of customer service. You saw us do that throughout the pandemic and it paid great dividends for us during that timeframe. The other thing we have talked about is investing in a disciplined way in IT, which is enabling growth in both our DIY and our commercial business. Every one of our growth initiatives, whether it\u2019s on the retail side of the business or the commercial side of the business, includes some element of improving the customer experience and those things have required us to accelerate some of our investments in IT. We like those investments. They are improving the customer experience. They are also improving the experience for our AutoZoners, and quite frankly, we think we will get benefits in terms of productivity in the future.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Could you walk us through the sequential performance for commercial in a little bit more detail as last quarter stepped down a touch on a multiyear basis, while this quarter bounced back nicely. So the question is, could you walk us through what you think could be driving the fluctuation in the do-it-for-me transactions from Q1 to Q2? And then with the three-year commercial compare looking a bit tougher, is it fair to assume that double-digit growth can sustain in the second half of the year?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. Great question. So a couple of things I will highlight. As I have mentioned, we have had 10 straight quarters of double-digit sales growth, and quite frankly, six of the last eight have been above 20%. We like the competitive dynamics in the marketplace today. We also like the fact that we are underpenetrated. We are a four to five share in a huge market that\u2019s approaching $100 billion. So there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to create a faster-growing business. If we look at our business on a two-year basis -- on a two-year stack basis, we are over 45%. So we like where we are from a commercial standpoint and all the initiatives that we have in place, improving the quality of our Duralast brand, expanding our assortments with our mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology and the competitive pricing dynamics that we saw in the marketplace a couple of years ago that we addressed give us a lot of confidence about it. So we have been comfortably double digits. You have heard us say that our goal is to continue to grow that share and growing that share means that we aspire to have a business that\u2019s growing double digits really as far as the eye can see.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And Jamere, just to clarify your gross margin commentary, you mentioned no negative LIFO impact in Q3. Does that mean your LIFO balance of $106 million remained stable in Q3 and Q4 or is it fair to expect that line to gradually or maybe more drastically shrink sequentially? And then big picture, is it fair to say that 52% gross margin is a fair run rate for the business going forward?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. So first, on LIFO, what we said is that, we anticipate minimal if any LIFO charges in 3Q and by the fourth quarter and certainly into FY 2024, we could potentially see that $106 million balance start to burn down, which means we would actually take gains through the P&L. It will take several quarters for us to work our way through $106 million based on our current forecast today. But we will be very transparent about what we are seeing and what gives us this confidence, quite frankly, is that as I mentioned before, we are seeing freight moderate. And as such, in the back half of this fiscal year, barring any disruptions like we have seen in the past, we are not expecting to take any charges and again, possibly see us flipping back to gains. In terms of our gross margin run rate, we have said that our commercial business is going to grow faster than our DIY business and that\u2019s going to put, let\u2019s call it, 35 basis points to 40 basis points of headwind on our gross margins going forward. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that you can expect our gross margins to deteriorate in the perpetuity. We are still running the same play with intensity inside the company to drive margin improvement that will mute some of that, if not offset all of it. So we feel pretty good about those initiatives. Our merchants and our supply chain teams are doing a tremendous job, as Bill mentioned before, not only working on in-stocks, but driving margin improvement. And as some of the cost pressures ease in the marketplace and some of the cost pressures that our vendors and suppliers have been seeing, it gives us an opportunity to go work on margins in a more fulsome way going forward.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hi, guys. I just had a quick question on your outlook for same SKU inflation for the rest of the year. I know you have said you think it\u2019s going to moderate somewhat. Just wondering do you think that would get to like the mid-single digits or low single-digit range?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. I wish I could answer. There\u2019s just so many pushes and pulls right now in the economy with our cost that I am not sure we can answer that. That seems like a reasonable assessment, but we are just going to manage through it just like we have. We have gone through some pretty big cycles over the last 24 months and we are going to manage our business appropriately, whether it\u2019s 5% or 7%, we are just going to manage through it.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And then just a follow-up on an earlier question, I know you mentioned transactions kind of accelerated in the quarter kind of and it really kind of offset some of the ticket decel. Do you think that could continue to happen or is there any data points that you think that, that might not happen again in the second half?\nBill Rhodes: I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. We hope that we can continue to -- we want to grow transactions. I talked about the challenges that are related to that, but our goal is to grow transactions. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are very focused on unit growth. We believe that\u2019s the lifeblood of this organization and we are focused on how do we grow units over the long term in both our retail and commercial business and we have been very pleased with the unit market share gains that we have had over the last three years and we are continuing to grow unit share even after the growth we have had over the last three years.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nJamere Jackson: Hi, Brian.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question, it\u2019s a bit of a follow-up to a prior question, but just with respect -- with regard to the commercial growth, we have seen substantial growth there for a while. As you move past the effects of the pandemic, the growth rates moderated, but still stayed very healthy. I guess how -- the question is how do you think about that longer term trajectory commercial growth and if you look at some of the markets that are maybe more mature for AutoZone, do they always give you insight into either from a market share perspective or more closer to a terminal type growth rate for that business?\nBill Rhodes: Well, terrific questions. I want to be clear about one thing. I don\u2019t believe the vast majority of the growth that we have seen in the commercial business over the last three years was a result of the pandemic. There\u2019s no question. The outside growth in our DIY business was mainly attributable to the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that was the case with commercial. I am sure it had some positive effects. But I think what -- the strategy that we began to deploy about four years ago have really been the driver of our commercial performance. Now as we continue to further and further mature on that strategy, we have seen some deceleration in our commercial growth. It\u2019s still fantastic, but it\u2019s not growing in the 20s. Our goal now is what\u2019s next and we are working on that even as we speak. What are the next levers that we are going to pull to continue to grow in the commercial business? Now just a reminder, we have got mid-teens market share in the retail business and we have about 25% or about 4% total market share in the commercial business. So we have got a tremendous runway in front of us. When you talk about certain markets and what do we see, we certainly have some markets that are more mature than others. I would say the most encouraging thing to me is to see how broad-based the acceleration has been in our 61 regions that we have across the United States. But I was in a market last week, arguably our most mature market, I am not going to tell you where that is. And it has significant hub coverage and it has significant mega-hub coverage and in that market we continue to grow at very rapid rates. And so I am particularly optimistic, as we continue to deploy the strategy of mega-hubs, so we still have -- we have roughly a little over 80 mega-hubs today. We are going to 200, and hopefully, in short order and then we are going to get to 300 hub stores. So that will be 500 stores in the United States with materially different product assortments than we have had historically. To me, that is the biggest part of our strategy.\nBrian Nagel: Yeah. That\u2019s very, very helpful. I appreciate it. And then as a quick follow-up, a different topic, you have mentioned in the prepared comments that you think the winter, I guess, it was harsh enough to drive that typical spring type business, you made that comment. The question I have is, as you look at the weather and it seemed to be very variable across the United States this year, are you seeing it much in the way of as kind of spread your comps between those markets which have been weather impacted versus those that have been less impacted?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. I mean, we always see that. But what my point was, we have been through years where we just didn\u2019t have a winter and it\u2019s not just the spring, frankly, it\u2019s as much in the summertime where we just don\u2019t see the parts failures on the failure side of the business that we do historically and the maintenance side. It\u2019s snow and ice and cold or all put stress on automobiles and we generally see that over the next six months to eight months once the winter subsides. So that\u2019s what I was really getting at. I do have a bit of caution right now. I talked about tax rebates that are flowing right now. The one thing that I worry about a little bit is, we haven\u2019t had great weather in the last week or so. We need to get some good weather, so DIYers can crawl underneath their cars, while these tax rebates are flowing, because we see a massive surge during this time of the year when our customers have more discretionary dollars.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nJackie Sussman: Hi. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Congrats on a good quarter. I guess, first, just on the used car cycle that kind of seems to be this ongoing tailwind for the industry. Is there any way to assess where we are in that cycle and I guess just lapping this higher mix of used cars or an older car fleet become a challenge at some point or do you guys expect a softer landing?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. So, clearly, used cars are still in tight supply and prices are up. We have seen prices moderate a little bit year-over-year, but they are still up 24% or so over a two-year basis. I think the second dynamic associated with that is, the fact that financing costs have gone up fairly significantly as well. So you have got interest rates that have made financing a vehicle, whether it\u2019s new or used, significantly more expensive. I think the combination of those two dynamics puts tremendous pressure on consumers and what we have seen historically is that when the consumer is under pressure, whether it\u2019s a recessionary cycle or it\u2019s a cycle where new and used car prices spike, they tend to hang on to their vehicles longer, invest in repairing those vehicles and ride to the other side of tougher market conditions and we certainly think that, that\u2019s going to be the case. So while the prices have come down, we still see a very tight market that\u2019s out there today, and quite frankly, a market that\u2019s significantly more expensive than what consumers experience prior to the pandemic.\nJackie Sussman: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And just quickly, another on the wage inflation, I guess, that kind of feels like the most stubborn cost pressure, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Is the way to think about it that the cost of business seems structurally higher as a result or are there efficiencies within the labor and fulfillment model you have that you could focus on as an offset?\nBill Rhodes: There\u2019s no question that the cost of doing business are structurally higher. And I just want to make sure I amplify this point, our wage rates are up double, more than double what they normally are and that is stick to your ribs inflation. It will be with us forever. But that\u2019s going to continue. And it\u2019s been going on for five years, not at this level, but we had acceleration before the pandemic and once the pandemic hit, it went up significantly more. But we have been able to manage it. We are looking for creative ways like always to be more and more efficient. But we can\u2019t drive that level of efficiency in a 43-year-old business without some kind of structural change, which we will be looking for, but we haven\u2019t identified at this point in time.\nJamere Jackson: And I just think from a macro standpoint, if you look at unemployment being at 3.4% or so and wage rates being in the -- with a five handle on them, I mean we are in a dynamic where the combination, as Bill said in his remarks, the combination of market pressures and regulatory pressures, which is an increasing push to raise minimum wage rates, this is an environment that we have to plan for in the future. The good news, again, about our industry is that, as we have seen inflationary impacts, whether it\u2019s product cost or it\u2019s wages or it\u2019s freight, I mean, we have typically seen this be an industry that is very disciplined about passing those costs along to consumers and given the relative inelasticity of the demand for our bread and butter products, we expect that to not cause our business to wobble at all.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from David Bellinger at Roth MKM.\nDavid Bellinger: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one on the sequential improvement in discretionary categories. Why do you think that\u2019s happening now, was there anything unique within the Q2 period? And are you seeing differences across demographics, meaning is the discretionary improvement also occurring with your lower or, call it, the lowest income customer base as well?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I mean what we have seen in total is that, our business has been remarkably resilient across both our upper income consumers, but also the lower end consumers. And again, that\u2019s because the lion\u2019s share of our business, our bread and butter categories, if you will or brake fix/failure, maintenance related sort of categories. The knock on effect of that is that to the extent that folks are making purchases for those bread and butter products if you will, then the discretionary categories tend to ride along with that as the basket gets built. So we have been fortunate in that regard. And the other thing that I don\u2019t want to underestimate and I actually want to underscore, is the fact that, we have been very focused on our growth initiatives and our growth initiatives are about driving more customers and more purchase occasions for AutoZone. And as a result of that, we are seeing the opportunity for us to continue to win some market share. So some of that sequential improvement that you are seeing in traffic is actually the impact of some of the things that we have been doing from a growth initiative to drive more customers into our store.\nDavid Bellinger: Thanks, Jamere. And my follow-up on the 4% market share you highlighted before in commercial, do you have a sense of where the more mature markets are tracking in terms of market share and should we think about that as potentially in the double digits at this point and a path to where some of these newer programs can get to in due time?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. We are definitely not in double digits in any markets that I am aware of. I would think maybe we are at 6% in that kind of ballpark. But look, if we have 16% or whatever share in retail, my thing is why can\u2019t we have that in commercial and that\u2019s the kind of thought process we need to have. I think one of our challenges is, sometimes we think about where we are and it limits what we think about the possibilities. We are trying to eliminate some of those glass ceilings, and say, why don\u2019t we have the same amount of share in both, which would mean the commercial business would be meaningfully larger than the retail business?\nJamere Jackson: And the good news for us is it\u2019s not just focused on new customers, but it is increasing our share of wallet with our existing customers. And to Bill\u2019s point, that\u2019s where we are focused as a company at getting what we believe our fair share or what our entitlement should be. We are pretty excited about those initiatives going forward.\nDavid Bellinger: Great. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Michael Lasser at UBS.\nAtul Maheswari: Good morning. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. The first question is on the commercial business, compared to last year, when you were regularly doing 20%-plus to now growing in 13% to 15%. So what has changed, is it just fewer new customer additions or less ticket per customer?\nBill Rhodes: Well, I think, as I said before, I think, part of what\u2019s changed is some of the massive improvements that we have made in our -- from our new strategy on commercial acceleration have matured more, but they are not mature. And so we are -- I would just say it this way, we are very pleased with the commercial growth that we have experienced over the last six months. And as I also said, we are looking for those next items that are in the next part of our strategy, they are going to drive accelerated growth.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. We are continuing to win market share. I mean, I would venture to say that the commercial market is not growing as fast as we are growing, which the knock on to that is that we are growing market share and we are pleased with our progress.\nAtul Maheswari: Got it. It makes sense. Thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you talked about tax refunds, but how are you thinking about near-term trends given some of the data source that tax refunds are lower year-over-year and then there\u2019s potentially some headwinds from Snap as well?\nBill Rhodes: Yeah. Look, we have never talked about Snap. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a big part driver for our business. The data we have available to us shows that tax refunds are remarkably similar to the way they were last year and are slightly up. We look at that data, it usually comes out on Mondays and we see where the big drops happened last week. Last week was a big drop as it was last year on tax refunds. So as far as we are concerned, we see everything on track, we are hoping that we get some great weather that\u2019s very conducive to DIY and that those customers come to us.\nAtul Maheswari: Thank you. Good luck to the rest of the year.\nBill Rhodes: Thank you very much.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks.\nBill Rhodes: Well, before we conclude\u2026\nOperator: Your next question\u2026\nBill Rhodes: Sorry, I thought you were -- I will go ahead. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we would like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 9.5% versus 8.6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance as we were up against 15.8% total sales growth in last year's second quarter. We could not have achieved these results without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Once again, our AutoZoners' efforts generated double-digit domestic commercial growth and single-digit domestic retail same-store sales growth. As we move further and further away from the societal impacts experienced as a result of the pandemic, we are very pleased with our team's ability to not only retain the tremendous growth we experienced over the last three years, but continue to grow on top of those phenomenal levels. Our team is relentlessly focused on getting back to normal or, as I call it, quote-unquote, exiting pandemic mode. We must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution. In all candor, we still aren't there yet. But we also have to reignite our innovation engine. We have some very good initiatives in development in both retail and commercial, and we have some significant improvements underway in our supply chain, as we modernize and expand it for the next decade of growth and beyond. We are halfway through our fiscal year and we are pleased with our performance so far. More encouraging, we feel good about the balance of the year and know our AutoZoners are keenly focused on delivering great service and terrific performance. This morning, we will review our second quarter same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional call-outs. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails, and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let's now move into more specifics on our performance. Domestic same-store sales were up 5.3%, our net income was $477 million and our EPS was $24.64 a share, increasing 10.5%. Our domestic same-store sales comp was on top of last year's 13.8% and in line with last quarter's 5.6% comp. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.1% comp, and get this, on a three-year basis, a 34.3% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results despite the comparison to the last couple of years being the hardest quarterly compare for the entire fiscal year. Now let me spend a few moments on growth, our growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic retail sales up nearly 5% and domestic commercial growth north of 13%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records with $955 million in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $111 million more in sales than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.5 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing 19% over last year. We also set another Q2 record for average weekly sales per store at $14,500 versus $13,500 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 28% this time last year. It was encouraging to see our transaction trends improving from last quarter. Our retail transactions meaningfully improved and were down just 2.2% for the quarter, while our commercial transactions were up mid-single digits and improving. Our average ticket in both retail and commercial experienced solid mid single-digit growth. Ticket growth decelerated from Q1 as we began to lap the acceleration in inflation we experienced this time last year. We are beginning to see signs of product cost and freight inflation slowing, and we expect to see these begin to return to historical norms over time. We are continuing to see -- to experience substantially higher wage inflation than historically in the mid single-digit range, more than double our historical experience. While the staffing environment is substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation abating soon as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we have to manage through these external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives are doing just that and include, new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega-hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. Our goal remains over time to become the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us confidence as we move forward. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this past quarter, we delivered a positive 2.7% comp on top of last year's 8.4%. Our DIY results were similar to last quarter's results on a one-year and two-year basis and accelerated on a three-year basis. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 5% versus last year. We are pleased with our transaction count trends improving as we reported transactions down just 2%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison to last year. From the data we have available, we continued to retain the majority of the dollar share gains we have built during the pandemic and we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of our success. Our performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of our sales growth for the remainder of the year. As we have shared forever, our second quarter is always the most volatile sales quarter due to the holidays, their timing shifts, and more importantly, weather, specifically extreme temperatures, which all can have a tremendous impact on our weekly sales. This quarter was no different, with softer sales at the beginning of the quarter when the weather was mild and wet, followed by a large spike around Christmas with the very cold temperatures the country experienced. We exited the quarter with normalized growth rates. We do believe we had enough harsh winter weather that we won't be talking about the lingering effects of a mild winter weather or mild winter for the next several months. Our attention has now turned to tax rebate season, which historically drives enormous demand in our category. Regarding our retail merchandise categories, our sales floor outperformed hard parts with approximately a 1.5% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales for categories is attributable to the discretionary categories improvement. As gas prices naturally have come down and consumer has shown surprising resiliency, our discretionary categories performed better. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to see our battery, oil and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations for much of the quarter. However, it bounced back late and we are encouraged by our recent trends. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this spring, as we expect miles driven to continue improving, while our growth initiatives continued delivering solid results. Let me also address pricing. In Q2, we experienced high single-digit pricing inflation in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the current quarter as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. Over the last three years, we have encouraged investors to keep a keen focus on our two-year and three-year comparisons. As we return to normal, we believe our year-over-year comparisons will be more and more relevant. While it's difficult to predict sales, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team is improving execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. For our third quarter 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives, combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to give a brief update on our supply chain initiatives. I will start with our in-stock position. I spent several quarters talking about how we were not back to where we were pre-pandemic. I am pleased to report, we are continuing to improve and are very close to our targets. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have worked diligently and creatively to get our levels back up, and we have made enormous progress. There are still a few categories where we are not where we want to be, but we will -- we have line of sight to putting this behind us. This has taken a lot of effort by our vendor community, and I'd like to publicly thank them for their tremendous efforts as well. We know this will pay future dividends. Second, our supply chain initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability are on track. One we have often highlighted is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets closer to the customer will lead to our ability to continue to say, yes, to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Additionally, we have previously announced the development of two new domestic distribution centers and additional capacity in Mexico. All three efforts are under construction and are expected to be completed by early fiscal 2025. These distribution centers will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores but also increase our capacity. With the tremendous sales growth we have experienced since 2020, the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I am excited that -- I am also excited we opened a facility on the West Coast recently to handle direct import product on a timelier and more effective and efficient basis. This new West Coast facility is already paying dividends by allowing products ordered abroad to be distributed to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent sales success, especially in commercial. Simply put, every time we intelligently add inventory to our network our sales grow. Lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil at almost 800 stores combined across the two markets. These businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future, and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be very successful. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered in the second quarter. But we must, we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. This year not only we would be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we will be opening many more mega-hub and hub stores, and we are focused on initiatives to continue driving strong performance in both our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. We remain focused on achieving our store opening goals, both domestically and internationally. We are working diligently to expand and enhance our supply chain and we have to achieve this growth, all while managing our costs appropriately. Simply said, we have to focus on exceptional execution in order to drive continued share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to four years from now and we welcome and accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone, which is led by AutoZoners. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Bret. Yeah. It's a fantastic question, Bret. I will start, and Jamere, you are welcome to build on it if you want to. First of all, I think, it's important for you all to understand, as we saw these enormous spikes in the freight cost, we did not pass all those costs along. I will use brake rotors, for instance. I mean the cost of shipping brake rotors from China to the U.S. were astronomical for a period of time. We couldn't pass all that costs on to the industry. So some of this is we will recoup some gross margin percentages that we didn't get in the midst of the freight issue. As we look forward, I think, you have to separate the gross margin piece from the labor piece. We are going to continue to see elevated wage growth. We have seen it now for probably five years, Bret. We will continue to monitor that. Our pricing is really more focused on what our product costs are and what those freight costs are. We will be mindful of labor costs. But generally, that's not a big driver of what we do with our pricing to the customer. What we need to do is make sure that we are finding ways to be as efficient as possible with the labor that we have, and over time, I think, wage rates will go back to more normalized growth rates. Yeah. First of all, at ALLDATA, we are very focused on providing value via our ALLDATA offerings to our customers at ALLDATA. We also look for ways that we can enhance our commercial relationship at AutoZone with their customers. We have done a lot of that by cross-selling, leveraging our two sales teams to generate leads for each other. So far, we haven't really integrated a lot with the, call it, up and down the street customer, but we have made some really meaningful progress with some of our national accounts and have some exciting things underway right now that helps integrate us more and more with them. Over time, that's certainly the vision that we have, is how can we be on their desktop as both ALLDATA and AutoZone in a seamless way, but we got to make sure that we don't drive the customer to that, that instead we have a product offering that the customer wants to adopt. Yeah. Thank you. It's a great question. Frankly, I don't have a great answer for you. As you know, you have been following this industry for a long time, one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that for decades and basically for the 28 years that I have been in this business, there has been transaction count declines and they have gone down over time, because the technology that has gone into the parts and products that we sell have increased, and therefore, the price of those products have increased. I often used the example of spark plugs. When I got in this business, we only sold copper clad spark bugs and they were $0.59 and they would last 30,000 miles. Today we sell Iridium spark plugs, it costs $11.99 and they will last 100,000 miles. There's many, many, many examples like that, 2.2% decline in retail transaction counts is historically very good. I just -- I would caution everybody, as I have mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q2 is our most volatile quarter every year and it is really driven by weather patterns. And so I don't want to read too much into an improvement in Q2, we were very excited to see it. Let's see how we do in Q2 and Q3. We are also still going up against the massive surge in growth that we had since 2019 as a result of COVID. So what we are focused on is, we thought for a period of time, that some of the sales growth that we experienced during COVID, we would give back. We are sitting here and have been for the last year saying, I don't think we are going to give it back, and now we are saying, look, we think we can grow from here and maybe have normalized growth rates and maybe even accelerated slightly growth rates to what we experienced historically, because of our growth initiatives. That's the way we are thinking about it. Does that make sense? Thank you. Yeah. That's a great question. I wish I could answer. There's just so many pushes and pulls right now in the economy with our cost that I am not sure we can answer that. That seems like a reasonable assessment, but we are just going to manage through it just like we have. We have gone through some pretty big cycles over the last 24 months and we are going to manage our business appropriately, whether it's 5% or 7%, we are just going to manage through it. I think that's a reasonable assumption. We hope that we can continue to -- we want to grow transactions. I talked about the challenges that are related to that, but our goal is to grow transactions. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are very focused on unit growth. We believe that's the lifeblood of this organization and we are focused on how do we grow units over the long term in both our retail and commercial business and we have been very pleased with the unit market share gains that we have had over the last three years and we are continuing to grow unit share even after the growth we have had over the last three years. Thank you. Good morning. Well, terrific questions. I want to be clear about one thing. I don't believe the vast majority of the growth that we have seen in the commercial business over the last three years was a result of the pandemic. There's no question. The outside growth in our DIY business was mainly attributable to the pandemic. I don't think that was the case with commercial. I am sure it had some positive effects. But I think what -- the strategy that we began to deploy about four years ago have really been the driver of our commercial performance. Now as we continue to further and further mature on that strategy, we have seen some deceleration in our commercial growth. It's still fantastic, but it's not growing in the 20s. Our goal now is what's next and we are working on that even as we speak. What are the next levers that we are going to pull to continue to grow in the commercial business? Now just a reminder, we have got mid-teens market share in the retail business and we have about 25% or about 4% total market share in the commercial business. So we have got a tremendous runway in front of us. When you talk about certain markets and what do we see, we certainly have some markets that are more mature than others. I would say the most encouraging thing to me is to see how broad-based the acceleration has been in our 61 regions that we have across the United States. But I was in a market last week, arguably our most mature market, I am not going to tell you where that is. And it has significant hub coverage and it has significant mega-hub coverage and in that market we continue to grow at very rapid rates. And so I am particularly optimistic, as we continue to deploy the strategy of mega-hubs, so we still have -- we have roughly a little over 80 mega-hubs today. We are going to 200, and hopefully, in short order and then we are going to get to 300 hub stores. So that will be 500 stores in the United States with materially different product assortments than we have had historically. To me, that is the biggest part of our strategy. Yeah. I mean, we always see that. But what my point was, we have been through years where we just didn't have a winter and it's not just the spring, frankly, it's as much in the summertime where we just don't see the parts failures on the failure side of the business that we do historically and the maintenance side. It's snow and ice and cold or all put stress on automobiles and we generally see that over the next six months to eight months once the winter subsides. So that's what I was really getting at. I do have a bit of caution right now. I talked about tax rebates that are flowing right now. The one thing that I worry about a little bit is, we haven't had great weather in the last week or so. We need to get some good weather, so DIYers can crawl underneath their cars, while these tax rebates are flowing, because we see a massive surge during this time of the year when our customers have more discretionary dollars. Yeah. Thank you. There's no question that the cost of doing business are structurally higher. And I just want to make sure I amplify this point, our wage rates are up double, more than double what they normally are and that is stick to your ribs inflation. It will be with us forever. But that's going to continue. And it's been going on for five years, not at this level, but we had acceleration before the pandemic and once the pandemic hit, it went up significantly more. But we have been able to manage it. We are looking for creative ways like always to be more and more efficient. But we can't drive that level of efficiency in a 43-year-old business without some kind of structural change, which we will be looking for, but we haven't identified at this point in time. Yeah. We are definitely not in double digits in any markets that I am aware of. I would think maybe we are at 6% in that kind of ballpark. But look, if we have 16% or whatever share in retail, my thing is why can't we have that in commercial and that's the kind of thought process we need to have. I think one of our challenges is, sometimes we think about where we are and it limits what we think about the possibilities. We are trying to eliminate some of those glass ceilings, and say, why don't we have the same amount of share in both, which would mean the commercial business would be meaningfully larger than the retail business? Thank you. Well, I think, as I said before, I think, part of what's changed is some of the massive improvements that we have made in our -- from our new strategy on commercial acceleration have matured more, but they are not mature. And so we are -- I would just say it this way, we are very pleased with the commercial growth that we have experienced over the last six months. And as I also said, we are looking for those next items that are in the next part of our strategy, they are going to drive accelerated growth. Yeah. Look, we have never talked about Snap. I don't think that that's a big part driver for our business. The data we have available to us shows that tax refunds are remarkably similar to the way they were last year and are slightly up. We look at that data, it usually comes out on Mondays and we see where the big drops happened last week. Last week was a big drop as it was last year on tax refunds. So as far as we are concerned, we see everything on track, we are hoping that we get some great weather that's very conducive to DIY and that those customers come to us. Thank you very much. Well, before we conclude... Sorry, I thought you were -- I will go ahead. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter stacked on top of exceptionally strong comps from last year. This quarter we delivered 5.3% domestic comp growth, a 6.9% increase in EBIT and a 10.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.7 billion, up 9.5%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives and let me give a little more color on those growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased just over 13% to $955 million and were up just over 45% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $14,500, up 7.4% and our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest second quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results, as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 41 net new programs, finishing with 5,500 total programs. As expected, commercial growth is leading the way in FY 2023 and we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. We have delivered double-digit sales growth for the past 10 quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I will add some color on our progress. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 81 mega-hub locations with one new one opened in Q2. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $14,500, the 81 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and grew significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q2. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs and more in certain cases and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parks and lifting the entire network. This strategy is working. We are targeting 25 new mega-hubs for FY 2023 and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega-hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers and improving our delivery times. We will build on our strong momentum over the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic retail comp was up 2.7% in Q2. This business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates remain solid and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw our traffic down 2.2% from last year's levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q1 where traffic was down 4%. We also saw 5% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, and a still challenging new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injection and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of FY 2023. Now I will say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico to finish with 707 stores and five new stores in Brazil ending with 81. On a constant currency basis, we meaningfully accelerated our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. We are bullish on international growth, and as Bill mentioned earlier, we are adding distribution center capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning in the market. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 69 basis points and included a 27-basis-point headwind stemming from a noncash $10 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 42 basis points in gross margin was driven by supply chain costs and our faster growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter's LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $106 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight cost is the primary driver for the charges. Both the first quarter and second quarter actuals are below the outlook we gave at the start of each quarter as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months and we expect this trend to continue. As such, we anticipate having minimal if any LIFO charges during the third quarter. As spot rates have come down, we have renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate. We expect to see these quarterly charges start to reverse during FY 2024, and quite possibly, as early as Q4. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance as we have done historically. Now moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.8% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A levered 24 basis points versus last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $670 million, up 6.9% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $10 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 8.5% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 54.5% from Q2 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7 billion versus $5.8 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $72 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42 million in last year's third quarter. Higher debt levels and expected continuing higher borrowing costs are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.2% and above last year's second quarter rate of 19.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 222 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 401 basis points. For the third quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Now moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $476.5 million, up 1% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.3 million was 8.6% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $24.64, up 10.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 2.6% and our EPS growth would have increased 12.3%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $210 million in free cash flow versus $260 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we have generated $900 million versus $930 million a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q2 last year and total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $227,000 versus negative $198,000 last year and negative $249,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 127.7% versus last year's Q2 of 126.8%. Lastly, I will spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased 906 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end, we had just under $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 4% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.3 times EBITDAR and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area during FY 2023. So to wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are growing our market share, and we are improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the back half of FY 2023, we are bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now I will turn it back to Bill. Hi, Bret. Yeah. And we haven't seen the moves and actions by our nearing competitors impact our business, really at all. Most of those moves, quite frankly, were targeted in much the same manner as our moves were a couple of years ago, which was how do we all improve our competitive hand relative to the warehouse distributors. So we haven't seen much of an impact there, and as a result of that, we don't see a need to make pricing actions to sort of counter what's being done in the marketplace by some of our newer competitors. Certainly does. I mean one of the things that we have been really clear about is that we are going to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster growing business and the two ways that we have done that. One, is investing in labor to maintain high levels of customer service. You saw us do that throughout the pandemic and it paid great dividends for us during that timeframe. The other thing we have talked about is investing in a disciplined way in IT, which is enabling growth in both our DIY and our commercial business. Every one of our growth initiatives, whether it's on the retail side of the business or the commercial side of the business, includes some element of improving the customer experience and those things have required us to accelerate some of our investments in IT. We like those investments. They are improving the customer experience. They are also improving the experience for our AutoZoners, and quite frankly, we think we will get benefits in terms of productivity in the future. Yeah. Great question. So a couple of things I will highlight. As I have mentioned, we have had 10 straight quarters of double-digit sales growth, and quite frankly, six of the last eight have been above 20%. We like the competitive dynamics in the marketplace today. We also like the fact that we are underpenetrated. We are a four to five share in a huge market that's approaching $100 billion. So there's a tremendous opportunity for us to create a faster-growing business. If we look at our business on a two-year basis -- on a two-year stack basis, we are over 45%. So we like where we are from a commercial standpoint and all the initiatives that we have in place, improving the quality of our Duralast brand, expanding our assortments with our mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology and the competitive pricing dynamics that we saw in the marketplace a couple of years ago that we addressed give us a lot of confidence about it. So we have been comfortably double digits. You have heard us say that our goal is to continue to grow that share and growing that share means that we aspire to have a business that's growing double digits really as far as the eye can see. Yeah. So first, on LIFO, what we said is that, we anticipate minimal if any LIFO charges in 3Q and by the fourth quarter and certainly into FY 2024, we could potentially see that $106 million balance start to burn down, which means we would actually take gains through the P&L. It will take several quarters for us to work our way through $106 million based on our current forecast today. But we will be very transparent about what we are seeing and what gives us this confidence, quite frankly, is that as I mentioned before, we are seeing freight moderate. And as such, in the back half of this fiscal year, barring any disruptions like we have seen in the past, we are not expecting to take any charges and again, possibly see us flipping back to gains. In terms of our gross margin run rate, we have said that our commercial business is going to grow faster than our DIY business and that's going to put, let's call it, 35 basis points to 40 basis points of headwind on our gross margins going forward. Now that doesn't mean that you can expect our gross margins to deteriorate in the perpetuity. We are still running the same play with intensity inside the company to drive margin improvement that will mute some of that, if not offset all of it. So we feel pretty good about those initiatives. Our merchants and our supply chain teams are doing a tremendous job, as Bill mentioned before, not only working on in-stocks, but driving margin improvement. And as some of the cost pressures ease in the marketplace and some of the cost pressures that our vendors and suppliers have been seeing, it gives us an opportunity to go work on margins in a more fulsome way going forward. Yeah. Hi, Brian. Thanks. Yeah. So, clearly, used cars are still in tight supply and prices are up. We have seen prices moderate a little bit year-over-year, but they are still up 24% or so over a two-year basis. I think the second dynamic associated with that is, the fact that financing costs have gone up fairly significantly as well. So you have got interest rates that have made financing a vehicle, whether it's new or used, significantly more expensive. I think the combination of those two dynamics puts tremendous pressure on consumers and what we have seen historically is that when the consumer is under pressure, whether it's a recessionary cycle or it's a cycle where new and used car prices spike, they tend to hang on to their vehicles longer, invest in repairing those vehicles and ride to the other side of tougher market conditions and we certainly think that, that's going to be the case. So while the prices have come down, we still see a very tight market that's out there today, and quite frankly, a market that's significantly more expensive than what consumers experience prior to the pandemic. And I just think from a macro standpoint, if you look at unemployment being at 3.4% or so and wage rates being in the -- with a five handle on them, I mean we are in a dynamic where the combination, as Bill said in his remarks, the combination of market pressures and regulatory pressures, which is an increasing push to raise minimum wage rates, this is an environment that we have to plan for in the future. The good news, again, about our industry is that, as we have seen inflationary impacts, whether it's product cost or it's wages or it's freight, I mean, we have typically seen this be an industry that is very disciplined about passing those costs along to consumers and given the relative inelasticity of the demand for our bread and butter products, we expect that to not cause our business to wobble at all. Yeah. I mean what we have seen in total is that, our business has been remarkably resilient across both our upper income consumers, but also the lower end consumers. And again, that's because the lion's share of our business, our bread and butter categories, if you will or brake fix/failure, maintenance related sort of categories. The knock on effect of that is that to the extent that folks are making purchases for those bread and butter products if you will, then the discretionary categories tend to ride along with that as the basket gets built. So we have been fortunate in that regard. And the other thing that I don't want to underestimate and I actually want to underscore, is the fact that, we have been very focused on our growth initiatives and our growth initiatives are about driving more customers and more purchase occasions for AutoZone. And as a result of that, we are seeing the opportunity for us to continue to win some market share. So some of that sequential improvement that you are seeing in traffic is actually the impact of some of the things that we have been doing from a growth initiative to drive more customers into our store. And the good news for us is it's not just focused on new customers, but it is increasing our share of wallet with our existing customers. And to Bill's point, that's where we are focused as a company at getting what we believe our fair share or what our entitlement should be. We are pretty excited about those initiatives going forward. Yeah. We are continuing to win market share. I mean, I would venture to say that the commercial market is not growing as fast as we are growing, which the knock on to that is that we are growing market share and we are pleased with our progress. Thanks."

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Text. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we\u2019d like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the enterprise for their commitment to taking care of our customers, which led to the strong results they continue to deliver. It has been a busy first quarter of our new fiscal year, as every day we strive to get back to normal and exit \u2018\u2018pandemic mode\u2019\u2019. This quarter, we opened our new direct import distribution center on the West Coast, continued to improve our in-stock position, and we had our first full national sales meeting since the pandemic began. In fact, we returned to having national sales meetings in every country where we operate and at ALLDATA. These meetings, they are critical to our success, where we celebrate our past accomplishments and lay the groundwork for our future success. Most importantly, they allow us to inspire each other and grow and nurture our unique and powerful culture. For the quarter, as our teams delivered exceptional service, their efforts led to our overall sales growing 8.6% on top of 16.3% last year. Our two-year growth rate marks some of the highest ever. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts generated a positive and accelerating retail same-store sales comp along with another strong commercial comp for the quarter. Thank you, AutoZoners, for always putting customers first which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q1 same-store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We\u2019ll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY \u201823. Our domestic same-store sales comp was a solid 5.6% this quarter, on top of last year\u2019s 13.6%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.2% comp, and on a three-year basis, a 31.5% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results, despite these difficult comparisons. Let me spend a few moments on growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth of 15%. We set a first quarter commercial sales record and over $1 billion in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $138 million more in sales than in Q1 last year. On a trailing four quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.4 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing $820 million over last year. We also set a Q1 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,000 versus 14,400 just last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 27% last year. Our sales growth in the quarter was driven by transaction growth from new and existing customers along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. Our commercial growth of 15%, while still very impressive, and well ahead of industry growth did slow. And unfortunately, we broke our streak of six straight quarters of 20% plus sales growth. While we could easily explain this resulted from a difficult comparison to last year\u2019s Q1 amazing growth of 29.4%, we also saw our transaction counts decline nearly 4 points from the pace we were growing in Q4 of fiscal \u201822. That said, we continue to be pleased with the results from the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings and improvements in coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with reduced delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We believe our offering to our customers is better than ever, and we continue to hear great things from our customers and prospective customers about the strength of our value proposition as we continue to execute our commercial acceleration strategy. Our goal remains, over time, to become the industry leader in both, DIY and commercial in every geography where we operate. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us tremendous confidence as we move forward. We\u2019re also very proud of our organization\u2019s performance in domestic DIY. Our growth in retail since the beginning of the pandemic has been remarkable, representing the highest three-year growth we have experienced in my 28-year tenure with the Company. We delivered a positive 2.6% comp this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 9%. And versus last year\u2019s -- quarter\u2019s growth, DIY grew on a two-year basis and on a three-year basis. While our ticket growth was similar to last quarter, of just over 7%, we are encouraged that our transaction count trends improved, decreasing by 4%. These results are very strong considering the difficult comparison, driven by the lingering effects of stimulus last year. From the data we have available, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous dollar share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And more importantly, we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of success for us. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability for our fiscal year. In terms of sales cadence, our total same-store sales trends were very consistent, increasing in the mid-single-digit range for each of the four-week periods. In addition, for Q1, our two-year comp was 19.2% and our three-year comp was 31.5% and relatively consistent over the four-week periods. We are incredibly pleased with the sustainability of the very large sales and share gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Weather did not have a material impact on our sales this quarter. On a national basis, weather trends were very similar to last year. Regionally, we saw less rainfall in the West and Southeast than last year. But overall, we didn\u2019t feel this drove our results materially. This winter\u2019s weather forecast calls for a slightly colder winter with, as we\u2019ve recently experienced, cooler weather beginning sooner. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, cold or hot drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. During the quarter, there was geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw comp sales in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets underperform the balance of the country by about 260 basis points. We believe that our underperformance in these markets was driven by milder and wetter weather this year. Four our second quarter, winter weather is likely to meaningfully influence our results. As a reminder, our Q2 is historically by far and away the most volatile sales quarter as weather patterns can greatly vary week-to-week. And we have key holidays that fall on different days of the week. At the moment, our forecasting team is telling us winter will likely be colder than last year\u2019s Q2. And if that happens, that would be a positive for our outlook. Now, let\u2019s move into more specifics on our performance. Same-store sales were up 5.6%, our net income was $539 million, and our EPS was $27.45 a share increase$0.45 a share, increasing 6.9%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed sales floor categories, with approximately 1% difference between them. With elevated gas prices, our discretionary categories remain soft. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales and were down 2.5% versus up 8% last year. In general, the categories that are driven by failures performed well and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lap very strong performance last year and again exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this winter as we expect miles driven to improve, while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. In Q1, we experienced 11% pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was also up 11%. We believe both numbers will decrease slightly in the current quarter, as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. But, to be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, thereby increasing margin dollars. It\u2019s also notable that following period\u2019s higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it still remains challenging for us to forecast near to mid-term sales as the economy impacts our customers. What I previously said on the past six quarterly calls is sales have been consistent on both a two-year and three-year stack comp basis. While it\u2019s difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team\u2019s execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Over the past year and a half, the overall macro environment has been a favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our second quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business, as we execute on our differentiating initiatives combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but also increase our capacity. Note that we didn\u2019t expect to grow our business 30%-plus in three years as we have, and the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I\u2019m also excited to announce that we opened a facility on the West Coast to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer. And we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. And we have initiatives in place to continue our growth trajectories in both, our domestic retail and commercial businesses. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses. At almost 800 stores combined, these businesses have had impressive performance again this quarter and should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil in particular, we are targeting to significantly and aggressively expand our store footprint over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\nJamere Jackson: Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, from a sales perspective, we had a strong first quarter stacked on top of an exceptionally strong first quarter last year with 5.6% domestic comp growth. We also had a 4.2% decrease in EBIT and a 6.9% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4 billion, up 8.6%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on some of our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased nearly 15% to $1 billion and were up 44.3% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,000, up 11.1%. And our growth was broad based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set a record for the highest first quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program and approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we\u2019re building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 117 net new programs finishing with 5,459 total programs. As I have said previously, commercial growth will lead the way in FY23. And we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments and local market availability, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past nine quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I\u2019ve noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we\u2019ve discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 80 mega hub locations with two new ones open in Q1. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,000, the 80 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry 80,000 to 110,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as surge as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both, our commercial and DIY business. What we\u2019re learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and list the entire network. This strategy is working. And we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We\u2019re targeting at least 25 new mega hubs in FY23. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers, and improving our delivery times. We\u2019re determined to build on our strong momentum. Our domestic retail business count was 2.6% in Q1. The business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates accelerated from Q4 and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 4% from last year\u2019s levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q4, where traffic was down 7%. We also saw 7% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY businesses continue to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and is still challenging, new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year\u2019s stimulus injection, and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady through the quarter, and we\u2019re forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY23. Now, I\u2019ll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 706 stores and 4 new stores in Brazil ending with 76. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect significant growth in store count internationally over the next five years. And we\u2019re excited about the future. In the spirit of our growth in store count outside of the U.S. we will celebrate our chain\u2019s 7,000th store opening this week in Leon, Mexico. I know Bill looks forward to being there to celebrate this historic event with our AutoZoners. We couldn\u2019t be more proud to celebrate this occasion with our Mexico team. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 242 basis points, driven primarily by a 203 basis-point headwind, stemming from a noncash $81 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 39 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by our faster-growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter\u2019s LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $96 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight costs are the primary driver for the charges. We are still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, and we anticipate approximately $40 million in LIFO charges during the second quarter. Both the first quarter actuals and our second quarter outlook are below the outlook we gave last quarter, as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months. As spot rates have come down, we have also renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate, and I want to remind everyone that at some point we expect to see these quarterly charges reverse, and we will begin to rebuild our LIFO reserve balance. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far, and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our LIFO reserve balances we have done historically. Moving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.6% versus last year\u2019s Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales were flat with last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $723 million, down 4.2% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Excluding the $81 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 6.6% over last year\u2019s quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $57.7 million, up 33.4% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q1 in last year, and our variable rates have increased significantly. We are planning interest in the $60 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42.5 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Higher debt levels and expected higher borrowing costs across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.9% and below last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 21.9%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 446 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year benefited 159 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $539 million, down 2.9% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.6 million was 9.1% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of lower net income, offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $27.45, up 6.9% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 8.3% and our EPS growth would have been 19.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the fourth quarter, we generated $794 million of operating cash flow, and spent $114 million in CapEx, allowing us to generate $680 million in free cash flow versus $676 million a year ago. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 14.4% versus Q1 last year, and total inventory increased 17.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $249,000 versus negative $207,000 last year, and negative $240,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 131% versus last year\u2019s Q1 of 129.4%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter end, we had just under $2.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buyback almost 2% of the shares outstanding at the start of the fiscal year. We have bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q1 at 2.2 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target during FY \u201823. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We\u2019re growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY \u201823, we\u2019re bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I turn it back to Bill, on December 5th, we celebrated Bill\u2019s 28th year anniversary with the Company. And I want to say congratulations to you, Bill. And it\u2019s been a remarkable ride.\nBill Rhodes : Thanks, Jamere. Fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture, a culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on our own opportunities for the New Year. Our team continues to work collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, we\u2019ve done a good job improving our in-stock position. But we still are a couple of hundred basis points below our historical norms. We\u2019re also being smart about adding new inventory coverage. We\u2019re meeting the ever-growing needs of our customers, especially our commercial customers, by being able to say, yes, we\u2019ve got it. It\u2019s a requirement. For the remainder of fiscal \u201823, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. Not only will we be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we\u2019ll be opening more mega hubs and hub stores. And we\u2019re focused on initiatives in place to continue driving strong performance in both, our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. Our vendors must return to providing us the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right, every hour of every day, and our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to focus on exceptional execution. It has made a difference for us for decades. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question this morning is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. So, the first question I have, just with respect to freight costs, and Jamere you talked about this in your comments, and you mentioned the LIFO issues. But I guess the question I have is as we think about your freight costs now and what you\u2019re seeing, where are you now tracking say, versus pre-pandemic? And then, even maybe putting some of the accounting noise aside, at what point could this become a tailwind to gross margins, as it really starts to work through the P&L?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Brian. International freight rates are back at pre-pandemic levels. And one of the things that we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call was this notion that during the height of the pandemic to secure capacity, we entered into some longer-term contracts. We\u2019re now in a position where as the spot rates have come down, we\u2019ve renegotiated some of those contracts. We have a pretty bullish outlook on where international freight rates are going to be for the balance of the year. Domestically, rates are still a little bit high. And as we work our way through the year, we expect those to start to abate a little bit. But domestically, the rates are still a little bit higher than what we would have anticipated. As it relates to LIFO, as you saw in the second quarter, we have lowered our outlook to be about a $40 million charge. And you could see in the back half of the year that abating completely. I won\u2019t be date certain about when we\u2019ll see this flip to gains rolling back through the P&L. But as we said last quarter, it could take the equivalent of three or four quarters before it all rolls through. And we see the gains come back through the P&L that offset the charges that we\u2019ve taken. So, our outlook is positive, and we\u2019re managing the business accordingly.\nBill Rhodes: Can I jump in and add a little color on one other element, not on LIFO, but on our normal product cost? Many of those freight costs are being capitalized as part of the inventory cost. So, we\u2019re going to have elevated product cost outside of LIFO for -- in a business that\u2019s turning 1.5 times a year for nine months or a year, whatever the case may be, once those freight costs abate. So, we\u2019ll continue to have pressure on product cost for foreseeable -- for an extended period of time.\nBrian Nagel: That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color there. And then as a quick follow-up, with respect to traffic, and also going back to the comments you made, so it\u2019s -- I think what you said was that the traffic in the stores, while still down in Q1, had improved from Q4, any comments on maybe the trajectory through the quarter? And then how are you thinking about traffic as we move into -- continue to progress through \u201823 here?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, Brian. So, when we\u2019re talking about traffic, we\u2019re predominantly talking about -- we are talking about our DIY business. I will be first to tell you that our DIY strength in Q1 was stronger than we expected, considerably stronger than we expected. And yes, our traffic counts are down 4%, but that was meaningfully better than -- I believe it was 8% in Q4. Remember -- and you\u2019ve been following this industry for a long time, there is a natural drag on DIY traffic counts that have been happening for 25-years. As you know, technology has gotten better and better on the products that we sell, and so they last longer. But there\u2019s also inherent inflation in those product costs as technologies are added to the products. So, a 4% traffic decline in the DIY business is not abnormal in normal times. And to see it down 4% after the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last three years was very encouraging to us.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone, and Bill, congratulations on the anniversary. My question is actually a follow-up to what you just mentioned, Bill. The traffic or I guess we will look at -- we try to call it units, I don\u2019t know if you would say that they\u2019re synonymous. It did look like it improved sequentially on a single-year basis. We don\u2019t see what the stacks have looked like, I think, on traffic or units. And curious if underlying stacks are also improving such that this is the rebasing and we are in the all clear in terms of units probably done reverting and the negative numbers are normalizing back to that negative 4% that you mentioned.\nBill Rhodes: Well, that\u2019s a strong statement, Simeon, in the all clear. I think we still have a level of anxiety on what the next year or so is going to look like coming off of unprecedented growth over the last three years. If we were on this call last year, we had expectations that our sales -- our same-store sales would decline, and they didn\u2019t. They were up considerably, and they were positive in DIY. Here we are again, comping off a positive DIY number with another positive DIY number. So, I think the farther we get away from the pandemic and the more resiliency we see in the DIY business, the more confidence we have that the gains that we picked up during the pandemic are sustainable. That said, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as \u201call clear\u201d.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is when we look at our business in our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, our volume trends have been strong, as Bill mentioned in his prepared comments. The relative inelasticity of demand there gives us a lot of confidence about that business. But in our discretionary categories, we were down 2.5%. And if you think about where consumers are feeling the most pressure today and where that pressure actually manifests itself, it manifests itself in discretionary purchases. And so, the fact that our discretionary business trends actually improved quarter-over-quarter, give us a lot of confidence about the future. That being said, there\u2019s still a lot of volatility and uncertainty, as Bill mentioned. We\u2019ll continue to manage our business accordingly.\nSimeon Gutman: And then my follow-up is on used car prices. The empirical evidence tied to the industry\u2019s growth isn\u2019t great, statistically speaking. But it certainly has been a benefit. And it still feels like the industry is benefiting from the surge that we\u2019ve seen. Are you finding there\u2019s sensitivity now on the way down? Do you feel like we\u2019re still benefiting from the surge? And then, if so, when does that tail off? And I don\u2019t know if it becomes a headwind or not in your minds?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I look at the macro in a pretty broad way. You\u2019ve got a couple of dynamics going. One, you have an ageing and growing car part. And used car prices, while they\u2019ve started to abate, they\u2019re still up almost 30% over the last two years. New car prices are up closer to 20%. And you\u2019re in an environment where you have rising interest rates that have made financing more challenging. So we do believe that it is still a little bit of a tailwind for our business. And more importantly, we\u2019ve been managing our business to take advantage of all of the robust market opportunities that we have, and this is just one portion of that. I think as we\u2019ve talked about our business and the growth that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not just that macro strength, but inflation has been our friend to some extent, driving higher prices, volumes held up under those dynamics. And our growth initiatives have helped us create a faster-growing business in both DIY and DIFM. So, when you take the combination of what you\u2019re seeing from inflation, from our growth initiatives, from the work that we\u2019ve done with hubs and mega-hubs and this macro strength, those are all the things that are in the soup, if you will, in terms of how our business is growing.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: You had mentioned at the beginning of the call about your improving in-stock position. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about that and where you see yourself by the end of \u201823 from an in-stock position? And then, I\u2019ll follow up with my second question. Thank you.\nBill Rhodes: Sure, Kate. Yes. Our in-stock position today is meaningfully better than it was at this time last year -- well, 18 months ago. It\u2019s up a little bit from this time last year. It\u2019s up a little bit from Q4, but we\u2019re still about 200 basis points below our historical expectations and experiences. When will it resolve? It still -- frankly, Kate, I would have thought it had been resolved by now. But there are certain product categories that are still a challenge, and we\u2019re looking to continue to find new sources in some of those categories and new geographies in some of those categories to help us get past it. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We feel very good about where we are competitively.\nKate McShane: And is there an expectation that you\u2019ll want to do better than the 200 basis points where you are below those expectations? And in terms of how much your sourcing has changed, has it been meaningful since where you used to source pre-pandemic?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. Our sourcing has not changed a significant amount at this point in time. We do have some objectives to diversify the geographies with which we source in basically every category. As far as having higher expectations for in-stock, right before the pandemic, we\u2019d reached an all-time high, which was 100 basis points ahead of where we were historically. So, our supply chain team -- need to remind them that we need to break our old high, which was 100 basis points higher. So, that would be about 300 basis points ahead of where we are right now. And I think they\u2019ll get there. It may take a little more time.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers: So, my first question is just to check the math, on the LIFO the headwinds being halved in the second quarter. So I guess, directionally, should we think about your gross margin headwind in the second quarter being roughly half of what you experienced in the first quarter?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I mean, we expect LIFO charge in the second quarter to be somewhere in the $40 millionish range, if you will. And so that will be significantly less pressure from a gross margin standpoint.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then, is -- as a follow-up to that and then a question on the SG&A side, I mean, is there -- other than the mix headwinds of Do-It-For-Me in gross margin, is there anything else to consider? And then on the SG&A side, SG&A dollar growth year-over-year has been running in this 8% to 10% range over the past four quarters. How much of that is wage and benefit cost inflation versus investing during the good times? And then going forward, how are you thinking about inflation and wages and SG&A in the context of your overall leverage point?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So, from an SG&A standpoint, I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster-growing business. As I said, we were flat as a percentage of sales this past quarter. But we\u2019ve been investing, and we\u2019ve been investing to maintain high levels of customer service. And we\u2019ve been investing because many of our growth initiatives, both on the retail and the commercial side of our business, are underpinned by investments in IT. So IT investments, in particular, are an enabler to what we\u2019re doing from a growth standpoint. As you know, wage pressure is a macro labor market issue, and we certainly haven\u2019t been immune to those dynamics. Historically, our wages have run in the, call it, the 2% ZIP code. It\u2019s been running closer to 5%. And so that\u2019s put some pressure on us. But what I\u2019ll say about SG&A over time is that we will continue to manage it in line with the top line. We\u2019ve been opportunistic as our business has grown to invest at an accelerated pace in some areas to support the growth in our business and to maintain great levels of customer service, and we\u2019ll continue to be very-disciplined about it going forward. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the first part of your question again?\nChris Horvers: Other than the mix of commercial versus DIY, is there any other variables that are different here in the second quarter in the context of that LIFO headwind being halved?\nJamere Jackson: No. We\u2019ve said that our faster-growing commercial business is likely going to put 35 basis points to 45 basis points of pressure on our gross margins. You saw that in this quarter. And we continue to expect our commercial business to grow significantly faster than our DIY business. And those are the kinds of headwinds that you\u2019ll see from a margin standpoint as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Bill, your tax in the commercial business remains quite consistent, but it did slow on a one-year basis. Do you think that\u2019s more related to something happening out of AutoZone where the log diminishing returns are taking over such that you\u2019re still generating similar amount of incremental sales, but it\u2019s just on a larger base, or is there something happening in the underlying trend of the commercial segment itself?\nBill Rhodes: It\u2019s a great question, Michael and one that, frankly, I\u2019m not sure that I can factually answer. I will start with 15% growth in our commercial business, we are all excited about that, especially coming off of the growth that we\u2019ve had in the last couple of years. So, we are pleased with the performance in our commercial business. It\u2019s widespread. The slowdown, the slight slowdown that we\u2019ve experienced is across the board. It\u2019s not national accounts. It\u2019s not up and down the street. It\u2019s not our ProVantage customers. We\u2019ve seen a general slowdown across different customer bases and across geographies. So, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s anything that we\u2019ve done at AutoZone. I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve grown very fast, and we grew 15% on top of it, and we\u2019re pleased with that.\nMichael Lasser: And is this now a more realistic run rate? It will still grow double digits? Is it hard to maintain that 20% that you have been achieving? And my follow-up is one of your competitors recently announced that they\u2019re going to make some price investments. This comes on the heels of another competitor emulating what you had done and make price investments. At what point should we call this a trend, and increased price transparency is just leading to a little bit more price competition within the commercial segment of the auto part retail sector?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, I\u2019ll leave it to you guys to define the trends that you want to do. What I can tell you is our pricing investments that we made about 18 months ago we had nothing to do with our close in competitors. They were focused on looking at our value proposition versus the 80% of the market that\u2019s outside of our close in competitors, and trying to make sure that we were priced right for the value proposition that we were delivering. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that and pleased with we\u2019re believing that our outside growth over the last couple of years has been driven not by taking share from our close in competitors by taking share from the broader market. And so I\u2019m not seeing anything by any indications based upon either of our close in competitors pricing that we see anything very different.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: I wanted to start on the commercial side. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you talked more about some tech investments you\u2019re making to make it easier -- I think you said easier to do business with you guys. Could you provide more detail on what those initiatives are? And then where are we -- what inning are we in, in terms of the rollout of these different tech programs on the commercial side?\nBill Rhodes: Sure, Daniel. Thank you. One of the things that we\u2019ve rolled out over the last couple of years is handheld devices for everybody that\u2019s in the store picking the products and everybody that\u2019s delivering to a commercial customer. And that helps us ensure that we have the exact right product, and it helps us manage delivery times, which we have brought our delivery times down about 20% since we deployed that technology. The other big part of it -- and there\u2019s a lot of different technology things that we\u2019re doing along the way. But the other big one that we\u2019ve done is really how we interact digitally with our commercial customers and -- from providing them access to invoices to making us more seamless to operate together, just trying to take the pressure points out and make a frictionless transaction with us. The handheld pieces have been deployed. We\u2019re continuing to refine the technology. And I suspect that those refinements will probably take up to another year or so. I think the digital integration is less far along. We have more newer ideas that we have yet to embark on, on the digital integration with our customers. And so, that\u2019s got to probably have two or three years of legs to it.\nDaniel Imbro: And then I want to follow up on Chris\u2019 question earlier on LIFO. So, Jamere, you provided a helpful color on 2Q. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expected to recognize some LIFO benefits in the back half of this year that would offset it. So if we just think about the $40 million you\u2019re now guiding for 2Q and a LIFO headwind, should we assume there\u2019s about $120 million of a LIFO benefit that\u2019s going to flow through the gross margin line in the back half of the year? And then, what would the cadence be that you\u2019d expect to recognize that $120 million benefit?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. Well, there are lots of things that will impact when we actually see the reversal of the charges that we take. The biggest one, as we mentioned, is the pace with which freight comes down and we get out of some of the contracts that we\u2019re in. And as I said before, we won\u2019t be date certain about when that actually happens, but we do anticipate that happens. So, it\u2019s moving in the right direction for us. And given that our inventory turns at, call it, 1.5 times, you should expect it to take two or three quarters potentially for us to have all of those costs worked their way through and us to see it turn the other way. So, we\u2019ll give a more fulsome update on our next quarter call. And as I said before, we\u2019ll be very transparent about what we\u2019re seeing.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Bellinger from MKM Partners.\nDavid Bellinger: The first one on commercial. It seems like the transaction counts maybe have been a bit slower this quarter. So, is there anything to read into that? And what type of consumer or customer activity are you seeing? Is there some type of deferral coming into play? Just any other details around the commercial counts would be helpful?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. We\u2019re doing a lot of studying on both our retail and commercial customers because if you think about it, this is a pretty unprecedented environment. I know I\u2019ve never seen inflation rates in the upper single digits and lower double digits. So, we\u2019re paying particular attention to what customer behaviors are happening. As a reminder -- and we certainly have more experience in the DIY business than we do in the commercial business, in the last economic shocks, the last four economic shocks in the U.S., our business has significantly outperformed normal periods of time. So, we\u2019re monitoring that to make sure we understand, particularly what\u2019s going on with the low-end consumer. And then, I think the expectation -- and we don\u2019t have near the evidence here at this point in time, but I believe that there\u2019s an expectation that some commercial customers or some jobs that a commercial customer would normally be done DIFM, can trade down into the DIY sector. And so, we\u2019re watching those kind of trends, but we don\u2019t see anything yet that is alarming to us. We continue to monitor it. And again, we\u2019re pretty darn pleased with the 15% growth in our commercial business.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. And then, just on the commercial program growth, that seemed to step up a little in Q1. It was about 5% year-over-year. Can you give us an update on how those programs are maturing? Is it still something like three to five years for those units to gain some material traction, or are you now seeing an accelerated pace in ramp-up, just given all the progress in the commercial business and the mega hub strategy?\nBill Rhodes: Sure. Well, we certainly stepped up openings in the first quarter. But remember, we\u2019re at about 88% of our stores have the commercial program today. There\u2019s no vision that we\u2019re going to be 100% or anywhere close to that. As you would imagine, the per store and per program economics of our commercial business over the last couple of years have changed pretty meaningfully. So, there are programs that now make sense to be open that two years ago, we might want to service them from another program. So, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. We may open another 100 or so, but I wouldn\u2019t expect for massive growth rates in commercial openings. And you\u2019re exactly right. It typically takes four or five years for those programs to mature. I think as we\u2019ve gotten stronger, they come out of the box higher than they did before. And we\u2019ll see what -- if the maturity lasts as long as it used to. The one place that is very different, they mature -- we don\u2019t know how long it takes for them to mature, but they come out of the gates much higher our mega hubs. It\u2019s amazing to see the volumes that we do almost day one coming out of a mega hub.\nDavid Bellinger: Thank, Bill. Enjoy the trip to Mexico.\nBill Rhodes: All right. Thanks. I look forward to it.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mike Baker at D.A. Davidson.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions. The spread between the ticket growth and inflation widened a little bit. It\u2019s now -- I think it was 4 percentage points in retail versus 3 last quarter. Remind us, is that -- are you seeing -- is it fewer units per transaction? Is it a trade down to less expensive items? Just any color on what\u2019s going on there?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. It\u2019s primarily basket mix that\u2019s impacting that. One of the things we\u2019ve been very disciplined about is moving retails, as we see cost and we\u2019ve been very transparent about what we\u2019re seeing there and been very disciplined about what we\u2019re doing. This is the entire industry.\nMike Baker: So, when you say basket mix, does that mean people trading down to lower more entry-level price points or private label? Just what exactly do you mean by basket mix?\nJamere Jackson: It could actually mean the types of products that are being purchased relative to what we saw in the previous period.\nMike Baker: Okay. And do you see that as any kind of sign of the consumer being strapped, or is it just sort of a random situation? What would cause that, I guess?\nJamere Jackson: Again, as we talked about the consumer, if you think about it from a macro standpoint, I mean, clearly, the consumer is feeling the pinch of inflation on multiple fronts. And quite frankly, inflation is going to erode consumer spending overall. But in our business, where we see the primary pressures in our discretionary categories and our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, the demand has been there. And the actions that we\u2019ve taken from a pricing standpoint have not impacted volume in a meaningful way, so. The other thing I\u2019ll say about just the consumer in general is it\u2019s clearly a two-speed world. The middle and upper end consumers have stronger balance sheets, and they\u2019re continuing to spend in a meaningful way and the lower end consumer is pitched. So, what we\u2019re seeing from our business standpoint is quite frankly consumers, when they have an opportunity, as Bill mentioned, to potentially trade into DIY from DIFM for certain things, they will do that. And these are the kinds of things that we\u2019d expect consumers to do over time. But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that tickets are 1 point or 2 below what we\u2019ve seen historically, most of that again is mix related.\nMike Baker: Well, if I could ask one more, how about the opposite now? Gas prices, believe it or not, are now lower than they were prior to the Russia-Ukraine situation and essentially flat year-over-year. Historically, can you remind us how much relief does that provide to your customers? And can that help offset some of those pressures that you just talked about?\nBill Rhodes: For sure, Mike. No question about it. If you recall -- you followed us for a year. So, one thing that we said that really does matter to our customer is gas prices, and particularly when they get over $4 a gallon. We\u2019ve said that for the last 15 years, there just seems to be something special about that $4 a gallon. Obviously, we\u2019re below that level now. But there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes that are going on with the customer today. We\u2019ve never seen this kind of combination. You got near double-digit inflation. You\u2019ve got low-end wage inflation that\u2019s up 5%, 6% across the marketplace. You\u2019ve got gas prices that went up exponentially and then quickly came back down. So, we\u2019re spending a lot of time looking at different stratus of our customer bases, particularly on the DIY side. And while we see some people trading down into -- on the good, better, best spectrum, we\u2019re not seeing any significant moves at this point in time. But we\u2019re obviously paying a lot of attention to it because these are kind of unprecedented underlying factors that are going into it.\nOperator: And that is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the floor back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for closing remarks.\nBill Rhodes: Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong, and our business model in particular is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress again that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season. And thank you for participating in today\u2019s call and for your interest in our company. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 first quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Text. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we'd like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the enterprise for their commitment to taking care of our customers, which led to the strong results they continue to deliver. It has been a busy first quarter of our new fiscal year, as every day we strive to get back to normal and exit \u2018\u2018pandemic mode''. This quarter, we opened our new direct import distribution center on the West Coast, continued to improve our in-stock position, and we had our first full national sales meeting since the pandemic began. In fact, we returned to having national sales meetings in every country where we operate and at ALLDATA. These meetings, they are critical to our success, where we celebrate our past accomplishments and lay the groundwork for our future success. Most importantly, they allow us to inspire each other and grow and nurture our unique and powerful culture. For the quarter, as our teams delivered exceptional service, their efforts led to our overall sales growing 8.6% on top of 16.3% last year. Our two-year growth rate marks some of the highest ever. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Our AutoZoners' efforts generated a positive and accelerating retail same-store sales comp along with another strong commercial comp for the quarter. Thank you, AutoZoners, for always putting customers first which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q1 same-store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY \u201823. Our domestic same-store sales comp was a solid 5.6% this quarter, on top of last year's 13.6%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.2% comp, and on a three-year basis, a 31.5% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results, despite these difficult comparisons. Let me spend a few moments on growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth of 15%. We set a first quarter commercial sales record and over $1 billion in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $138 million more in sales than in Q1 last year. On a trailing four quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.4 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing $820 million over last year. We also set a Q1 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,000 versus 14,400 just last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 27% last year. Our sales growth in the quarter was driven by transaction growth from new and existing customers along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. Our commercial growth of 15%, while still very impressive, and well ahead of industry growth did slow. And unfortunately, we broke our streak of six straight quarters of 20% plus sales growth. While we could easily explain this resulted from a difficult comparison to last year's Q1 amazing growth of 29.4%, we also saw our transaction counts decline nearly 4 points from the pace we were growing in Q4 of fiscal \u201822. That said, we continue to be pleased with the results from the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings and improvements in coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with reduced delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We believe our offering to our customers is better than ever, and we continue to hear great things from our customers and prospective customers about the strength of our value proposition as we continue to execute our commercial acceleration strategy. Our goal remains, over time, to become the industry leader in both, DIY and commercial in every geography where we operate. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us tremendous confidence as we move forward. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. Our growth in retail since the beginning of the pandemic has been remarkable, representing the highest three-year growth we have experienced in my 28-year tenure with the Company. We delivered a positive 2.6% comp this quarter on top of last year's 9%. And versus last year's -- quarter's growth, DIY grew on a two-year basis and on a three-year basis. While our ticket growth was similar to last quarter, of just over 7%, we are encouraged that our transaction count trends improved, decreasing by 4%. These results are very strong considering the difficult comparison, driven by the lingering effects of stimulus last year. From the data we have available, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous dollar share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And more importantly, we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of success for us. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability for our fiscal year. In terms of sales cadence, our total same-store sales trends were very consistent, increasing in the mid-single-digit range for each of the four-week periods. In addition, for Q1, our two-year comp was 19.2% and our three-year comp was 31.5% and relatively consistent over the four-week periods. We are incredibly pleased with the sustainability of the very large sales and share gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Weather did not have a material impact on our sales this quarter. On a national basis, weather trends were very similar to last year. Regionally, we saw less rainfall in the West and Southeast than last year. But overall, we didn't feel this drove our results materially. This winter's weather forecast calls for a slightly colder winter with, as we've recently experienced, cooler weather beginning sooner. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, cold or hot drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. During the quarter, there was geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw comp sales in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets underperform the balance of the country by about 260 basis points. We believe that our underperformance in these markets was driven by milder and wetter weather this year. Four our second quarter, winter weather is likely to meaningfully influence our results. As a reminder, our Q2 is historically by far and away the most volatile sales quarter as weather patterns can greatly vary week-to-week. And we have key holidays that fall on different days of the week. At the moment, our forecasting team is telling us winter will likely be colder than last year's Q2. And if that happens, that would be a positive for our outlook. Now, let's move into more specifics on our performance. Same-store sales were up 5.6%, our net income was $539 million, and our EPS was $27.45 a share increase$0.45 a share, increasing 6.9%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed sales floor categories, with approximately 1% difference between them. With elevated gas prices, our discretionary categories remain soft. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales and were down 2.5% versus up 8% last year. In general, the categories that are driven by failures performed well and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lap very strong performance last year and again exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this winter as we expect miles driven to improve, while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. In Q1, we experienced 11% pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was also up 11%. We believe both numbers will decrease slightly in the current quarter, as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. But, to be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, thereby increasing margin dollars. It's also notable that following period's higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it still remains challenging for us to forecast near to mid-term sales as the economy impacts our customers. What I previously said on the past six quarterly calls is sales have been consistent on both a two-year and three-year stack comp basis. While it's difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Over the past year and a half, the overall macro environment has been a favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our second quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business, as we execute on our differentiating initiatives combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to give a brief update on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but also increase our capacity. Note that we didn't expect to grow our business 30%-plus in three years as we have, and the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I'm also excited to announce that we opened a facility on the West Coast to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer. And we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. And we have initiatives in place to continue our growth trajectories in both, our domestic retail and commercial businesses. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses. At almost 800 stores combined, these businesses have had impressive performance again this quarter and should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil in particular, we are targeting to significantly and aggressively expand our store footprint over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Thanks, Jamere. Fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture, a culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on our own opportunities for the New Year. Our team continues to work collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, we've done a good job improving our in-stock position. But we still are a couple of hundred basis points below our historical norms. We're also being smart about adding new inventory coverage. We're meeting the ever-growing needs of our customers, especially our commercial customers, by being able to say, yes, we've got it. It's a requirement. For the remainder of fiscal \u201823, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. Not only will we be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we'll be opening more mega hubs and hub stores. And we're focused on initiatives in place to continue driving strong performance in both, our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. Our vendors must return to providing us the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right, every hour of every day, and our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to focus on exceptional execution. It has made a difference for us for decades. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Can I jump in and add a little color on one other element, not on LIFO, but on our normal product cost? Many of those freight costs are being capitalized as part of the inventory cost. So, we're going to have elevated product cost outside of LIFO for -- in a business that's turning 1.5 times a year for nine months or a year, whatever the case may be, once those freight costs abate. So, we'll continue to have pressure on product cost for foreseeable -- for an extended period of time. Yes, Brian. So, when we're talking about traffic, we're predominantly talking about -- we are talking about our DIY business. I will be first to tell you that our DIY strength in Q1 was stronger than we expected, considerably stronger than we expected. And yes, our traffic counts are down 4%, but that was meaningfully better than -- I believe it was 8% in Q4. Remember -- and you've been following this industry for a long time, there is a natural drag on DIY traffic counts that have been happening for 25-years. As you know, technology has gotten better and better on the products that we sell, and so they last longer. But there's also inherent inflation in those product costs as technologies are added to the products. So, a 4% traffic decline in the DIY business is not abnormal in normal times. And to see it down 4% after the growth that we've seen over the last three years was very encouraging to us. Well, that's a strong statement, Simeon, in the all clear. I think we still have a level of anxiety on what the next year or so is going to look like coming off of unprecedented growth over the last three years. If we were on this call last year, we had expectations that our sales -- our same-store sales would decline, and they didn't. They were up considerably, and they were positive in DIY. Here we are again, comping off a positive DIY number with another positive DIY number. So, I think the farther we get away from the pandemic and the more resiliency we see in the DIY business, the more confidence we have that the gains that we picked up during the pandemic are sustainable. That said, I wouldn't characterize it as \u201call clear\u201d. Sure, Kate. Yes. Our in-stock position today is meaningfully better than it was at this time last year -- well, 18 months ago. It's up a little bit from this time last year. It's up a little bit from Q4, but we're still about 200 basis points below our historical expectations and experiences. When will it resolve? It still -- frankly, Kate, I would have thought it had been resolved by now. But there are certain product categories that are still a challenge, and we're looking to continue to find new sources in some of those categories and new geographies in some of those categories to help us get past it. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We feel very good about where we are competitively. Yes. Our sourcing has not changed a significant amount at this point in time. We do have some objectives to diversify the geographies with which we source in basically every category. As far as having higher expectations for in-stock, right before the pandemic, we'd reached an all-time high, which was 100 basis points ahead of where we were historically. So, our supply chain team -- need to remind them that we need to break our old high, which was 100 basis points higher. So, that would be about 300 basis points ahead of where we are right now. And I think they'll get there. It may take a little more time. It's a great question, Michael and one that, frankly, I'm not sure that I can factually answer. I will start with 15% growth in our commercial business, we are all excited about that, especially coming off of the growth that we've had in the last couple of years. So, we are pleased with the performance in our commercial business. It's widespread. The slowdown, the slight slowdown that we've experienced is across the board. It's not national accounts. It's not up and down the street. It's not our ProVantage customers. We've seen a general slowdown across different customer bases and across geographies. So, I don't think that it's anything that we've done at AutoZone. I think it's -- we've grown very fast, and we grew 15% on top of it, and we're pleased with that. Yes, I'll leave it to you guys to define the trends that you want to do. What I can tell you is our pricing investments that we made about 18 months ago we had nothing to do with our close in competitors. They were focused on looking at our value proposition versus the 80% of the market that's outside of our close in competitors, and trying to make sure that we were priced right for the value proposition that we were delivering. We've been very pleased with that and pleased with we're believing that our outside growth over the last couple of years has been driven not by taking share from our close in competitors by taking share from the broader market. And so I'm not seeing anything by any indications based upon either of our close in competitors pricing that we see anything very different. Sure, Daniel. Thank you. One of the things that we've rolled out over the last couple of years is handheld devices for everybody that's in the store picking the products and everybody that's delivering to a commercial customer. And that helps us ensure that we have the exact right product, and it helps us manage delivery times, which we have brought our delivery times down about 20% since we deployed that technology. The other big part of it -- and there's a lot of different technology things that we're doing along the way. But the other big one that we've done is really how we interact digitally with our commercial customers and -- from providing them access to invoices to making us more seamless to operate together, just trying to take the pressure points out and make a frictionless transaction with us. The handheld pieces have been deployed. We're continuing to refine the technology. And I suspect that those refinements will probably take up to another year or so. I think the digital integration is less far along. We have more newer ideas that we have yet to embark on, on the digital integration with our customers. And so, that's got to probably have two or three years of legs to it. Yes. We're doing a lot of studying on both our retail and commercial customers because if you think about it, this is a pretty unprecedented environment. I know I've never seen inflation rates in the upper single digits and lower double digits. So, we're paying particular attention to what customer behaviors are happening. As a reminder -- and we certainly have more experience in the DIY business than we do in the commercial business, in the last economic shocks, the last four economic shocks in the U.S., our business has significantly outperformed normal periods of time. So, we're monitoring that to make sure we understand, particularly what's going on with the low-end consumer. And then, I think the expectation -- and we don't have near the evidence here at this point in time, but I believe that there's an expectation that some commercial customers or some jobs that a commercial customer would normally be done DIFM, can trade down into the DIY sector. And so, we're watching those kind of trends, but we don't see anything yet that is alarming to us. We continue to monitor it. And again, we're pretty darn pleased with the 15% growth in our commercial business. Sure. Well, we certainly stepped up openings in the first quarter. But remember, we're at about 88% of our stores have the commercial program today. There's no vision that we're going to be 100% or anywhere close to that. As you would imagine, the per store and per program economics of our commercial business over the last couple of years have changed pretty meaningfully. So, there are programs that now make sense to be open that two years ago, we might want to service them from another program. So, that's what you're seeing. We may open another 100 or so, but I wouldn't expect for massive growth rates in commercial openings. And you're exactly right. It typically takes four or five years for those programs to mature. I think as we've gotten stronger, they come out of the box higher than they did before. And we'll see what -- if the maturity lasts as long as it used to. The one place that is very different, they mature -- we don't know how long it takes for them to mature, but they come out of the gates much higher our mega hubs. It's amazing to see the volumes that we do almost day one coming out of a mega hub. All right. Thanks. I look forward to it. For sure, Mike. No question about it. If you recall -- you followed us for a year. So, one thing that we said that really does matter to our customer is gas prices, and particularly when they get over $4 a gallon. We've said that for the last 15 years, there just seems to be something special about that $4 a gallon. Obviously, we're below that level now. But there's a lot of puts and takes that are going on with the customer today. We've never seen this kind of combination. You got near double-digit inflation. You've got low-end wage inflation that's up 5%, 6% across the marketplace. You've got gas prices that went up exponentially and then quickly came back down. So, we're spending a lot of time looking at different stratus of our customer bases, particularly on the DIY side. And while we see some people trading down into -- on the good, better, best spectrum, we're not seeing any significant moves at this point in time. But we're obviously paying a lot of attention to it because these are kind of unprecedented underlying factors that are going into it. Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong, and our business model in particular is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress again that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season. And thank you for participating in today's call and for your interest in our company. Have a great day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, from a sales perspective, we had a strong first quarter stacked on top of an exceptionally strong first quarter last year with 5.6% domestic comp growth. We also had a 4.2% decrease in EBIT and a 6.9% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4 billion, up 8.6%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on some of our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased nearly 15% to $1 billion and were up 44.3% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,000, up 11.1%. And our growth was broad based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set a record for the highest first quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program and approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 117 net new programs finishing with 5,459 total programs. As I have said previously, commercial growth will lead the way in FY23. And we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments and local market availability, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past nine quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I've noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 80 mega hub locations with two new ones open in Q1. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,000, the 80 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry 80,000 to 110,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as surge as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both, our commercial and DIY business. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and list the entire network. This strategy is working. And we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We're targeting at least 25 new mega hubs in FY23. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers, and improving our delivery times. We're determined to build on our strong momentum. Our domestic retail business count was 2.6% in Q1. The business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates accelerated from Q4 and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 4% from last year's levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q4, where traffic was down 7%. We also saw 7% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY businesses continue to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and is still challenging, new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injection, and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady through the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY23. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 706 stores and 4 new stores in Brazil ending with 76. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect significant growth in store count internationally over the next five years. And we're excited about the future. In the spirit of our growth in store count outside of the U.S. we will celebrate our chain's 7,000th store opening this week in Leon, Mexico. I know Bill looks forward to being there to celebrate this historic event with our AutoZoners. We couldn't be more proud to celebrate this occasion with our Mexico team. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 242 basis points, driven primarily by a 203 basis-point headwind, stemming from a noncash $81 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 39 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by our faster-growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter's LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $96 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight costs are the primary driver for the charges. We are still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, and we anticipate approximately $40 million in LIFO charges during the second quarter. Both the first quarter actuals and our second quarter outlook are below the outlook we gave last quarter, as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months. As spot rates have come down, we have also renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate, and I want to remind everyone that at some point we expect to see these quarterly charges reverse, and we will begin to rebuild our LIFO reserve balance. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far, and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our LIFO reserve balances we have done historically. Moving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.6% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales were flat with last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $723 million, down 4.2% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $81 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 6.6% over last year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $57.7 million, up 33.4% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q1 in last year, and our variable rates have increased significantly. We are planning interest in the $60 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42.5 million in last year's second quarter. Higher debt levels and expected higher borrowing costs across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.9% and below last year's first quarter rate of 21.9%. This quarter's rate benefited 446 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year benefited 159 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $539 million, down 2.9% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.6 million was 9.1% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of lower net income, offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $27.45, up 6.9% over the prior year's first quarter. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 8.3% and our EPS growth would have been 19.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the fourth quarter, we generated $794 million of operating cash flow, and spent $114 million in CapEx, allowing us to generate $680 million in free cash flow versus $676 million a year ago. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 14.4% versus Q1 last year, and total inventory increased 17.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $249,000 versus negative $207,000 last year, and negative $240,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 131% versus last year's Q1 of 129.4%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter end, we had just under $2.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buyback almost 2% of the shares outstanding at the start of the fiscal year. We have bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q1 at 2.2 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target during FY \u201823. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY \u201823, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I turn it back to Bill, on December 5th, we celebrated Bill's 28th year anniversary with the Company. And I want to say congratulations to you, Bill. And it's been a remarkable ride. Yes. Thanks, Brian. International freight rates are back at pre-pandemic levels. And one of the things that we discussed on last quarter's call was this notion that during the height of the pandemic to secure capacity, we entered into some longer-term contracts. We're now in a position where as the spot rates have come down, we've renegotiated some of those contracts. We have a pretty bullish outlook on where international freight rates are going to be for the balance of the year. Domestically, rates are still a little bit high. And as we work our way through the year, we expect those to start to abate a little bit. But domestically, the rates are still a little bit higher than what we would have anticipated. As it relates to LIFO, as you saw in the second quarter, we have lowered our outlook to be about a $40 million charge. And you could see in the back half of the year that abating completely. I won't be date certain about when we'll see this flip to gains rolling back through the P&L. But as we said last quarter, it could take the equivalent of three or four quarters before it all rolls through. And we see the gains come back through the P&L that offset the charges that we've taken. So, our outlook is positive, and we're managing the business accordingly. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is when we look at our business in our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, our volume trends have been strong, as Bill mentioned in his prepared comments. The relative inelasticity of demand there gives us a lot of confidence about that business. But in our discretionary categories, we were down 2.5%. And if you think about where consumers are feeling the most pressure today and where that pressure actually manifests itself, it manifests itself in discretionary purchases. And so, the fact that our discretionary business trends actually improved quarter-over-quarter, give us a lot of confidence about the future. That being said, there's still a lot of volatility and uncertainty, as Bill mentioned. We'll continue to manage our business accordingly. Yes. I look at the macro in a pretty broad way. You've got a couple of dynamics going. One, you have an ageing and growing car part. And used car prices, while they've started to abate, they're still up almost 30% over the last two years. New car prices are up closer to 20%. And you're in an environment where you have rising interest rates that have made financing more challenging. So we do believe that it is still a little bit of a tailwind for our business. And more importantly, we've been managing our business to take advantage of all of the robust market opportunities that we have, and this is just one portion of that. I think as we've talked about our business and the growth that we're seeing, it's not just that macro strength, but inflation has been our friend to some extent, driving higher prices, volumes held up under those dynamics. And our growth initiatives have helped us create a faster-growing business in both DIY and DIFM. So, when you take the combination of what you're seeing from inflation, from our growth initiatives, from the work that we've done with hubs and mega-hubs and this macro strength, those are all the things that are in the soup, if you will, in terms of how our business is growing. Yes. I mean, we expect LIFO charge in the second quarter to be somewhere in the $40 millionish range, if you will. And so that will be significantly less pressure from a gross margin standpoint. Yes. So, from an SG&A standpoint, I mean, we're going to continue to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster-growing business. As I said, we were flat as a percentage of sales this past quarter. But we've been investing, and we've been investing to maintain high levels of customer service. And we've been investing because many of our growth initiatives, both on the retail and the commercial side of our business, are underpinned by investments in IT. So IT investments, in particular, are an enabler to what we're doing from a growth standpoint. As you know, wage pressure is a macro labor market issue, and we certainly haven't been immune to those dynamics. Historically, our wages have run in the, call it, the 2% ZIP code. It's been running closer to 5%. And so that's put some pressure on us. But what I'll say about SG&A over time is that we will continue to manage it in line with the top line. We've been opportunistic as our business has grown to invest at an accelerated pace in some areas to support the growth in our business and to maintain great levels of customer service, and we'll continue to be very-disciplined about it going forward. And I'm sorry, what was the first part of your question again? No. We've said that our faster-growing commercial business is likely going to put 35 basis points to 45 basis points of pressure on our gross margins. You saw that in this quarter. And we continue to expect our commercial business to grow significantly faster than our DIY business. And those are the kinds of headwinds that you'll see from a margin standpoint as we move forward. Yes. Well, there are lots of things that will impact when we actually see the reversal of the charges that we take. The biggest one, as we mentioned, is the pace with which freight comes down and we get out of some of the contracts that we're in. And as I said before, we won't be date certain about when that actually happens, but we do anticipate that happens. So, it's moving in the right direction for us. And given that our inventory turns at, call it, 1.5 times, you should expect it to take two or three quarters potentially for us to have all of those costs worked their way through and us to see it turn the other way. So, we'll give a more fulsome update on our next quarter call. And as I said before, we'll be very transparent about what we're seeing. Yes. It's primarily basket mix that's impacting that. One of the things we've been very disciplined about is moving retails, as we see cost and we've been very transparent about what we're seeing there and been very disciplined about what we're doing. This is the entire industry. It could actually mean the types of products that are being purchased relative to what we saw in the previous period. Again, as we talked about the consumer, if you think about it from a macro standpoint, I mean, clearly, the consumer is feeling the pinch of inflation on multiple fronts. And quite frankly, inflation is going to erode consumer spending overall. But in our business, where we see the primary pressures in our discretionary categories and our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, the demand has been there. And the actions that we've taken from a pricing standpoint have not impacted volume in a meaningful way, so. The other thing I'll say about just the consumer in general is it's clearly a two-speed world. The middle and upper end consumers have stronger balance sheets, and they're continuing to spend in a meaningful way and the lower end consumer is pitched. So, what we're seeing from our business standpoint is quite frankly consumers, when they have an opportunity, as Bill mentioned, to potentially trade into DIY from DIFM for certain things, they will do that. And these are the kinds of things that we'd expect consumers to do over time. But I wouldn't read anything into the fact that tickets are 1 point or 2 below what we've seen historically, most of that again is mix related."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Phil Daniele, CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about our quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call to see them. As we begin this morning, I want to thank our more than 120,000 AutoZoners for their contributions during fiscal 2024 that resulted in our solid performance. As the first line of our pledge states, they continue putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 5.9% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 13%. As a reminder, this fiscal year had an extra week of results. So, excluding the 53rd week, our sales were up 3.8%, while our EPS was up 10.4%. In the fourth quarter, with our continued focus on what we call Wow! Customer Service, our total sales were up 9%, while EPS was up 11%. On a 16-week basis, our Q4 sales were up 2.6%, while our EPS was up 3.5%. We also delivered 1.3% total company same-store sales, domestic same-store sales growth of 0.2%, and international same-store sales up 9.9%. Our domestic commercial sales accelerated sequentially, finishing up 4.5% versus last year's Q4 of 3.9%. This is on a 16-week versus 16-week basis. We were up 10.9% on a 17-week versus 16-week basis. While our international business continued to comp up approximately 10% in local currencies, we faced a nearly 500 points of currency headwind and our reported growth rate is approximately 5%. As you know, the weaker US dollar has been a tailwind for our reported results, since we began reporting international comps last year in our fourth quarter earnings report. The stronger dollar had a meaningful impact on our reported sales, operating profit, and EPS this quarter. Jamere will update the potential impact of foreign currency on FY '25 later in the call. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in the quarter's results, what has been consistent is that we could not have achieved both this quarter's and this year's success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization. So, let me dive into our sales results. First off, I will say that our domestic DIY results were very similar to last quarter. Q4's DIY comp sales were down about 1%. The impact from the headwind on our discretionary merchandise categories drove the bulk of this decline, similar to last quarter. For our fourth quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 18% of our mix and they were down roughly 5% year-over-year, again similar to our results in previous quarters this fiscal year. We have seen this trend for the entire fiscal year and our belief is that these categories will continue to be pressured until the consumer gets some economic relief and customer confidence improves -- consumer confidence improves. With regards to our inflation impact on the DIY comp, we saw both average ticket and like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1% for the quarter. While still low versus historical norms, the growth is a good trend for us as we would expect inflation in our ticket average to be approximately 3% over time. We anticipate average ticket growth will return to historical industry growth rates as we move farther away from the hyperinflation of the last couple of years. We also saw DIY transactions count down 2%. While our industry overall sales growth rate for DIY appears to be down over the last quarter, it was very encouraging to see our market share growth in DIY. We believe we have a best-in-class offering, and this gives us confidence that when our consumers return to their historical shopping habits, we will be the beneficiaries of that upswing. Secondly, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. Simply put, it was consistent across the country as each of our 10 reporting census regions delivered approximately a 1% negative comp. Third, I will address weather and what we believe the impact was on our DIY business. We clearly saw hot weather across the U.S. this past summer. And in those markets where the weather was hot, our sales increased accordingly. However, across the majority of the country, the weather pattern was similar to the previous year and, therefore, did not have a meaningful impact on our performance. Next, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. While we reported this morning that our commercial sales were up 10.9% for the quarter, on a 16-week comparable basis to last year, our sales were up 4.5%. We were encouraged to see our U.S. commercial sales growth. This past quarter marked another quarter of sequential increases to year-over-year DIFM sales. We saw very little variation in the commercial sales across regions as the entire country was basically running at the overall sales growth rate of 4.5% on a 16-week basis. While we are encouraged by the progress we are making, we still have significant opportunities in front of us to grow market share, with improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of our Duralast brand, and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improve customer service. We are confident about our future. This quarter, inflation on a like-for-like SKU basis was essentially flat, which drove flat pricing and average ticket for commercial. We have seen pricing remain relatively flat as inflation has cooled for goods in our industry. We expect to see slightly more inflation next year, and our assumption is like-for-like SKU retail inflation will be in the low-single-digits in FY '25. For the year, we opened eight hubs and 11 mega-hubs, which is roughly half of what we did in FY '23. We are excited about the ability to resume aggressively opening these important assets in FY '25, although openings will be somewhat second-half loaded. Hubs and mega-hubs lead to comp results that grow faster than the balance of the chain and we are going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets. For our first quarter of FY '25, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to modestly improve. We expect better sales performance in Q2 and the Q3 timeframes. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends change. Before turning the call to Jamere, I would like to take a moment to discuss our international business. We were busy opening stores this quarter. Between Mexico and Brazil, we opened 49 new stores and now have 921 international stores. As you can see from our press release, our same-store sales were just under 10%. We remain committed to growing the number of stores in both Mexico and Brazil. Today, we have 13% of our store -- total store base outside of the U.S. and expect that number will continue to grow. We plan to accelerate our openings by 2028, and we are targeting around 200 international openings per year. We continue to take our U.S. store learnings and introduce them to the international store operations, and we are very excited about our future in international. In summary, we have continued to invest in making end-market inventory assortments better to drive future traffic growth and sales, enhancing our IT systems and our supply chain. In FY '25, we'll continue to ramp up our store openings, specifically our hubs and mega-hubs and drive efficiencies from our new DCs, which are expected to come online in 2025. At AutoZone, we are investing in our future growth initiatives. In FY '24, we invested more than $1 billion in CapEx and are focused on our strategic growth priorities. In FY '25, you will see more of the same. We are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically hubs and mega-hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers, distribution centers that will drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs, IT systems that will improve customer service and improve our AutoZoners' ability to help our customers. We believe that our industry is strong and we have an opportunity to grow market share domestically and internationally. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Before I unpack our results, I want to remind you that each year, our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. Based on the way the calendar fell this year, we had an extra week in our fiscal year and the fourth quarter is based on 17 weeks versus 16 weeks. For comparison, our same-store sales comps are based on a 16-week basis, while our total sales, EBIT, and EPS results will be discussed on a 17-week basis. As Phil has previously discussed, we reported 9% total company sales growth. On a 16-week basis, total company sales were up 2.6%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 0.2% and our international comp was up 9.9% on a constant-currency basis. Total company EBIT grew 6.1% and our EPS grew 11%. I also want to point out that we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates in this quarter. We had a 500-basis-points drag on international sales that resulted in a $32 million headwind to sales, an $8 million headwind to EBIT, and $0.32 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. We continue to deliver solid results despite the economic backdrop, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $6.2 billion and, as I just mentioned, was up 9%. For the year, our total sales were $18.5 billion, up 5.9% versus last fiscal year. Let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 10.9% to $1.7 billion. On a 16-week basis, our domestic commercial business grew 4.5%. For FY '24, our commercial sales were $4.9 billion, up 6.2% versus last year. In the quarter, sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto parts sales and 27% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,700 flat to last year as we lap new programs that we opened that are not at maturity. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 55 net new programs, finishing with 5,898 total programs. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will aggressively pursue growth in commercial, which represents a tremendous growth opportunity for our company. To support our commercial growth, we now have 109 mega-hub locations. While I mentioned a moment ago, our commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 109 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have an objective to have well north of 200 mega-hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in the local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels. On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was down 1.1% for the quarter. For all of FY '24, our DIY comp was down [0.6%] (ph). Despite the industry softness, we continue to gain share in DIY and we are well-positioned when the industry reaccelerates. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2% along with 1% ticket growth. And as we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low- to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in-line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY business has continued to gain share behind our growth initiatives. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds, we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '25. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 31 new stores in Mexico to finish with 794 stores, and 18 new stores in Brazil, ending with 127. Our same-store sales grew 9.9% on a constant-currency basis and 4.9% when taken into account foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to international, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. We're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.5%, down 21 basis points, driven primarily by an unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 32-basis-point improvement in gross margin, driven by continued improvement in merchandising margins. For Q4 last year, we had a $30 million LIFO credit, while this year, we did not have any credits. We previously said that we thought we would have approximately $10 million of LIFO credits in the quarter, which would have equated to 16 bps of higher gross margins or $0.45 a share. At year-end, we had $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L. At the moment, we are not anticipating any charges or credits to our P&L for Q1 of FY '25, as inflation has not materially impacted our LIFO inventory accounting results. I will remind you that in last year's first quarter, we booked $2 million LIFO credit. And as a reminder, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 37 basis points. On a 16-week basis, our SG&A was up 4.6%. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in-line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 6.1% versus the prior year. EBIT for FY '24 was just under $3.8 billion, up 9.1% versus the prior year, driven by top-line growth and gross margin improvement. Interest expense for the quarter was $153.2 million, up 41% from Q4 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.7 billion at Q4-end last year. We're planning interest in the $108 million range for the first quarter of FY '25 versus $91.4 million in this year -- in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.1%, and down from last year's fourth quarter of 22.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 80 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year had benefited 22 basis points. For the first quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $902 million, up 4.3% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.5 million was 6% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $51.58, up a 11% for the quarter. For FY '24, net income was $2.7 billion, up 5.3%, and earnings per share was $149.55, up 13%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $723 million in free cash flow, and for the year, we generated $1.9 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being in an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 3.7% versus Q4 last year, while total inventory increased 6.8% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-store basis, was a negative $163,000 versus negative $201,000 last year and negative $168,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 119.5% versus last year's Q4 of 124.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $711 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter-end, we had just under $2.2 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998 while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share domestically and internationally, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY '25, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so our results reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held constant for Q1 FY '25, then we expect an approximate $55 million drag on revenue, a $16 million drag on EBIT, and a $0.63 a share drag on EPS. And if rates remained at the current spot rates for the full fiscal year 2025, we would expect an approximate $265 million impact to revenues, a $90 million impact to EBIT, and a $3.64 a share impact to full year EPS. And now, I'll turn it back to Phil.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you, Jamere. We're proud of our AutoZoners across the globe and the results our team delivered this past quarter. In FY '24, we focused on improving execution and driving Wow! Customer Service. We made meaningful progress and are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid, and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital to work where we'll have the biggest impact on sales. Our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say \"yes\" to our customers' needs. The top focus areas for fiscal 2025 will remain growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in our international markets. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability, flawless execution and what we call Wow! Customer Service will lead to sales growth and gains in market share. We're excited to start 2025. This time of year, we also enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this past fiscal year: $18.5 billion in sales, headed toward the $20 billion milestone; commercial sales are about to eclipse $5 billion, it wasn't that long ago we just crossed across $2 billion, that was only 2017; average weekly sales domestically of $47,000 a week, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually; our Mexico and our ALLDATA teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil has now more than 100 stores and is growing; we bought back $3.2 billion in AutoZone stock, marking $37 billion in buybacks since the start of our program back in '98. As we start our new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment and discuss our operating theme for this New Year, \"Great People, Great Service.\" I am asked frequently what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer always goes back to the same point over and over again, our AutoZoners and AutoZone's amazing culture. Our AutoZoners have built this culture. This year, we will focus on our AutoZoners like never before. We are determined to improve upon an already existing culture of service. Next week will mark the start of our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis. Just over 3,000 AutoZoners will be in Memphis to learn about our parts and products, celebrate this past year's accomplishments, as well as allowing our leadership to celebrate and recognize the best-performing store and distribution center AutoZoners. We cannot wait to have everyone here. But we can't rest on our laurels and we aren't without our challenges, that's for sure. We must make sure that every store is staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function properly, always, and we have to meet our new store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been. Fiscal 2025's top priorities will continue to be based on improving execution, and we will continue to invest in our following strategic projects: reaccelerate our new hub and mega-hub openings; effectively and efficiently open our new distribution centers and optimize our direct import facility; ramp-up our domestic and international store growth; as discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant-currency basis of 10.2%, continuing several years of very strong growth; and most importantly, reaccelerate our domestic commercial sales growth and continue to gain market share on DIY. Also this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that Ken Jaycox joined AutoZone this past quarter as our Senior Vice President, Commercial. Ken is a strong addition for us, having served most recently at U.S. Steel where he served as their Senior Vice President and Commercial Chief Officer. He has extensive experience in the B2B space and has developed and led world-class sales teams. He is a great cultural fit, and we are fortunate to have Ken join us. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering even better results. We believe in our potential for future growth. We believe in AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Everyone at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning. Hey, Phil, you mentioned accelerating commercial sales growth. You made a hire recently, and we talked about hubs on the call, and I think you're tweaking inventory. Can you talk about timing? What should investors expect? What you expect out of the organization? When we could see commercial sales move to that next level?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah, it's a great question. Thanks, Simeon. I think we will sequentially improve from here. Again, I'd -- like we've talked about on the last couple of calls, I think it's a progressive improvement. I don't think it's going to be a snapback. If you look at the environment out there, the consumer is still pressured and we think that's showing up on both DIY and the commercial side of the business, but we like our strategies that we have in place as far as exactly what you said, incrementally improving the store side assortments at the satellite stores, opening up these hubs and mega-hubs, and adding inventory closer to the customers. And then, we're also working on ways to streamline customer service, specifically improving speed to customer on those harder-to-find parts. So, we like our strategy, and we think we'll continue to build from here.\nSimeon Gutman: And then, a quick follow-up on gross margin. What's left, and how high it can go? Because I think discretionary being down would have hurt you, commercial being up would probably hurt you. So, how do you -- I guess, where is the drive? Where is the strength coming from? And how much can it continue?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah, I think, we got a couple of things working in our favor. One, our merchants are doing a fantastic job driving merchandising margin improvements and negotiating with our supply base, and that team has done a tremendous job for us. So, I think, as we move forward, we'll continue to drive merch margin improvements. We have a little bit of a drag early on because we're adding a couple of DCs associated with the supply chain efforts that we have, but net-net, we think that the merchandising margin improvements will continue to power us moving forward. The one area that we're watching very closely is what's happening in the industry from a pricing standpoint, as Phil alluded to and I alluded to as well, that we're not seeing the average ticket growth. That's largely a function of what we're seeing on the inflation side. As we get some additional inflation that starts to make its way into the industry, we're looking forward to having an opportunity to push retails a little bit harder. So, a very disciplined approach, very strong merchandising margins, and we're looking forward to a pretty good outlook for FY '25.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. Good luck.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nPhil Daniele: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Could you talk about what, if any, are the hurdles to reaccelerating the hub growth now that the three major players are all using a hub strategy? Is it a real estate access issue, or is it just sort of timing of your internal development team?\nJamere Jackson: Phil always smiles when we get this question, because I own store development inside of our organization. We feel very good about what we've done, essentially what we've done over the last year or so is rebuilding our pipeline and our capabilities. Obviously, and we've talked about it here on the call, we struggled a little bit as we got through the pandemic. Everything was generally delayed during that timeframe, but the reality is that there were things that we needed to improve from an operational standpoint to really improve that pipeline. We're pretty excited about where we are on hubs and mega-hubs. We still have our plan to open 200-plus mega-hubs versus our original estimate of 110. We'll build 20-plus in FY '25 and I'm really excited about the fact that we have about 70 mega-hubs in the pipeline today, most of which are under construction. So, I feel good about the team, what we've executed on, et cetera. These are big 30,000-square-foot boxes and tough to find locations, but we've reorganized our team and doubled down on our efforts to get those boxes into the marketplace. I'm excited about what they'll contribute to our future growth prospects.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Then a follow-up on the commercial business. I mean, can you talk about the cadence through the quarter and then any dispersion between national account business versus the up-and-down the street business?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. If you talk about the cadence -- the quarter, like I said, both regionally and the cadence across the quarter were all pretty similar. If you -- the very beginning of the quarter was a little bit lighter. June was great. Some of it due to the hot weather came a little bit earlier this year. And then, when you got into July and August, it was pretty similar to last year from a weather perspective. So, you didn't see meaningful change in July and August from a comp perspective. Where it was hot, we saw all the categories take off like you would expect. So, we had a good summer. It wasn't demonstrably different than last year though. And so, that's kind of how we think about that from a quarter perspective. Sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nBret Jordan: And, I guess, national account versus the up-and-down the street business, are you seeing any change in the independent, the WD competitive landscape out there around the net -- around the up-and-down the street?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. So, on national accounts, that's a great question. We kind of think of our -- the up-and-down the street customer. We think about national accounts and then we have what we call some verticals. And I'll explain kind of how we saw performance across those segments. The up-and-down the street customer has been very resilient, been one of the best-growing segments for us. The national accounts have improved quarter-over-quarter, and part of that improvement has come from a lot of those national accounts are heavily tied towards tires and tires are not as bad as they used to be. The trends have improved. We're seeing more tire replacements, even though those customers generally, I think, are seeing down customer traffic, but tires are not the big drag that they have historically been. The one segment that has not performed very good for us and, as I say, I think it's going to make sense, it's anything related to new cars, used cars, or [buyer payer] (ph) lots. As cars change hands, there's generally an uptick in maintenance. To a used car, they may refurb and put on -- put tires on, put on new brakes, suspension items, change all the filters, do some maintenance, et cetera. And as that new customer picks up the new car, they may continue to personalize it. So, that segment of the business, which we're highly penetrated in, has not performed as well. We think as the environment and the economy improves a little bit and we see more used cars change hands and new cars being sold that will help those two segments of the business.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nChris Horvers: Thanks, and good morning. Can you talk about where you think the DIY -- domestic DIY and domestic commercial markets are growing? You mentioned share gains in DIY, but you comped down [1] (ph). So, any thoughts on where you think those markets are -- grew during the quarter, and how we think about the improvement in the backdrop over FY '25?\nPhil Daniele: Great question. Thank you. So, on DIY, as we said, the biggest pressure point has really been in the discretionary part categories of the business. So, think of that accessories, truck towing performance, things of that nature. That business has been pretty tough for us for at least a year. And when you look at the share gains, that sort of area is where we've seen the most challenging performance. In our maintenance categories and our failure categories on the DIY side of the business, they have been pretty resilient, but it's those headwinds from the discretionary categories that have been tough. And we frankly don't know that that's going to change too much until that our pressured consumer starts to get some economic relief and, frankly, when their confidence starts to improve a bit. On the commercial side, we believe we're still one of the fastest-growing in the industry, a little bit of a tougher comp scenario, but we believe we're growing share and we like our strategies of deploying inventory through the hub and the mega-hub assortments. And we have several strategies that are focused on improving customer service in commercial, and we're seeing really good results from those.\nJamere Jackson: And I would say, just to build on that, I mean, if you think about the growth rates, we actually believe that the DIY market has been down kind of low-single-digits because of those dynamics that Phil talked about, but also the fact that we're not seeing the same level of retail inflation. Tickets are still growing slower than the historical levels and that's put some pressure on it. So, a combination of the consumer sentiment, the fact that we are not seeing retail inflation are sort of driving that business down a little bit. But what we're excited about is the fact that we continue to execute, as Phil mentioned, I mean, we're providing great service to the customer. And as that portion of the industry reaccelerates, we'll be in great shape. And on the commercial side, I mean, as near as we can tell, I mean, commercial has been flat to declining for -- or slightly declining for a few quarters here. And if we look at what we saw this quarter, it was probably in a similar sort of zip code. So, we're excited about the fact that we've accelerated our commercial sales growth. And as we move forward, the execution on our initiatives that Phil talked about, the fact that we'll get more hubs and mega-hubs in our marketplace, all bode well for us as we move forward.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then, a couple of quick margin follow-ups. First on the gross margin. It looks like that 53rd week, the gross margin was maybe 80 basis points lower. So, is there something to read into that? You talked about being positive on gross margin over the year, but some DC pressures. So, is that just accounting nuance or something that we should think about in terms of cadence? And then secondly, on the potential FX headwind, the international implied operating margin for the year is materially higher than the quarter, so what you experience in the fourth quarter. So, is that the 53rd week impact, or is there something going on there?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah, so the 53rd week is always a little bit noisy for us, just in general in terms of how allocations happen, et cetera. So, I wouldn't read much into how you think about it. I mean, overall for the total company, we had about $365 million of sales and about $87 million of EBIT associated with that extra week when you look at it on a like-for-like basis. And I wouldn't -- the margin impacts and SG&A impacts and all those things can get a little bit skewed just based on how you do allocations in the quarter. What I'll say about international and the international margins as we think about it going forward, it's a very strong business for us. Our business in Mexico has basically doubled over the last three fiscal years or so. So, given that significant revenue and EBIT impact of our international footprint, swings in FX rates are going to impact us, et cetera. The teams are doing a great job of executing and we wanted to be really transparent on what we see in terms of FX moving forward and what the margin impact is going to be going forward.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is live.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Phil, Jamere.\nPhil Daniele: Good morning, Steven.\nSteven Forbes: Maybe just a follow-up to start on the commercial business. Maybe if we just focus on sort of weekly sales per commercial program. If we adjust for the extra week contribution, it looks like your sales were sort of down mid-single-digits year-over-year. Any way to help contextualize sort of what's driving that and/or, right, any sort of initial thoughts on how your initiatives on speed of delivery, right, customer service you may help inflect that, right, as we look out over the coming quarters here and potentially get it back to growing?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. Well, again, if you compare the 16-weeks to 16-weeks, we were up 4.5% versus last year. So -- and it sequentially from the last three quarters, that's three quarters in a row of growing trend on our commercial sales. If you look at what we're focused on with the -- obviously, improving our assortments is something we do all the time. I think our merchants have done a fantastic job of improving the store-level assortments and also improving the store -- the hub and mega-hub assortments within any given market that may have one of those types of boxes. What we're focused on is utilizing deployed inventory in a given market, either in a hub or a satellite, and getting that inventory quicker to the customer at the shop level. So, we think of it in terms of time, speed to shop, how quickly can we get that inventory from wherever it may be to the shop, the fastest way to improve customer service. And as you back up to a hub or a mega-hub, the assortments get deeper, and how do we get that product to those customers faster. We've deployed quite a bit of technology over the last couple of years. We continue to leverage that technology and learn how to improve the customer service at the -- for the AutoZoners, allowing them to help the customer better, as well as getting that inventory quicker to the customer wherever that inventory maybe. And we're seeing really good results. We like the strategy. What I'll tell you is, it's dependent on having a hub and a mega-hub, which is why this strategy of having more hubs deployed with those inventory assets closer to the customer is so important. We wish we could go faster. We'll start reaccelerating those hub and mega-hubs later in the year. And then, we've got a -- as Jamere mentioned, we've got a great pipeline. We feel good about the future. We know where we want all of these big boxes to be. Of all the sites, well north of 200 of them on the mega-hub side. We know where they are. It's just a matter of negotiating and getting them open.\nSteven Forbes: I appreciate the color. And then, just a quick follow-up for Jamere. I appreciate the quantification of FX, assuming all things constant, the release, obviously, quantified the EBIT contribution of the extra week. You also called out LIFO. If we add these up, right, we have sort of a mid-single-digit headwind to EBIT growth next year. Is that the right way to frame up sort of the non-controllable headwinds to EBIT growth, or anything else you want to add as we think about sort of cleansing the models here?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah, there's really two pieces. One is, we had about $40 million of LIFO credits that roll through the P&L this year, that become headwinds next year. Now depending on what happens from an inflation standpoint, we've got about $19 million of credits still to come before we go back to an unrecorded balance. So, you could offset maybe half of that $40 million benefit that you had this year on the LIFO side. So that should help you from a modeling standpoint. And then, from an FX standpoint, we try to be transparent about where the spot rates are. We're certainly not making a prediction on where FX is going to land. There are lots of things that will impact that, certainly, things that happened in the U.S. economy, things that happened in the international economies, and some of the political dynamics. So, what we wanted to do is just be really transparent about where the spot rates currently are and what the impact could potentially be on our P&L. We'll update you as we move through the year. It's been pretty volatile. You've seen a pretty significant spike probably to the tune of 20% or 25% in a very short period of time. And again, as I said, given the size of international and our P&L and the profitability of that business, it does have an impact. So, we'll be transparent and share with you exactly what we see as it rolls its way through the P&L.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is live.\nRobbie Ohmes: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping, could you guys talk a little bit more about seeing inflation return and what the drivers to that normally are or what they could be. And maybe as part of that, remind us how historically tariffs and port strikes and things like that impact inflation for you guys?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. So, let me kind of back up, and we've talked about this a couple of different times, the historical growth rates versus what we're seeing today in ticket average. It's been fairly muted over the last year or so at around this 1% retail inflation and ticket average inflation that's been muted, both -- on both sides of the business, similar numbers that are down from historical rates. Over the long-term and I'm talking literally close, somewhere between 20 and 30 years, the industry has generally seen somewhere between 3% and 5% inflation in average ticket and around 1% to 3% decline in transactions, typically driven by inflation of parts as well as technology, enhancements in quality of the product. We believe that sometime in the near-time horizon, we would revert back to a historical growth rate on both of those metrics. What we typically see what drives inflation is mix of business -- drives ticket average is mix of business converting to higher technology parts, which generally speaking are more expensive and inflation caused by product cost. Over the last year, there hasn't been much product costs come into the system. And we all believe that that's because of -- if you look back through the pandemic years when we had the supply chain constraints, we had massive inflation in cost and we took those retails and pushed them to the consumer and we ended up with this hyperinflation. We're now lapping a lot of that and that trend starts to slow down kind of now going through the end of the year, and we would expect that inflation would come back in sometime in '25 and get back to normal. As far as tariffs, your question there that -- those sorts of things have ebbed and flowed over the years. If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer and we'll pass them through. As they turn through, we'll generally raise prices ahead of -- we know what the tariffs will be. We generally raise prices ahead of that. You get some gross margin improvement as the cost of goods turn in and then it flattens out. So, that's historically what we've done. I see no reason this industry has been very consistent on pricing and rational and we believe that all those same metrics are still in place.\nRobbie Ohmes: Thanks. And just a quick follow-up since you brought up the last 20 to 30 years. When over the last 20 to 30 years has the consumer been like this? You guys are talking about on the DIY side a challenged consumer. What happened last time the consumer was like this?\nPhil Daniele: Gosh, I don't know -- well, that's a great question. The consumer is under much different pressure. The bottom-end consumer has been pressured for the last 20 months or so or maybe more, but it's ebbed and flowed over recessions, et cetera. Have we seen the type of inflation that we saw over the last three years? No, not -- certainly not in my lifetime. But generally speaking, in tougher economic times, people will generally defer maintenance and discretionary items early in the cycle. And then, as we get further through the cycle, they start to repair their cars because they realize a little investment today, maintaining their vehicle defers a major repair into the future. So, we think it's going to ebb and flow over time, but we feel like our execution, our improvement in execution and our strategies are the right strategies for us and we'll work over the long-term.\nJamere Jackson: Just a little more on the consumer. I mean, a couple of things really stand out to us. One is, if you look at the economy just in general, I've said this for a while that you've had this sort of this two-speed world where the middle- and upper-income consumers have strong balance sheets and are continuing to spend as normal, and the lower-end is feeling the pinch, particularly in the discretionary categories. The beauty of our business is that the lion's share of our business is relatively inelastic, it's break-fix, it's essential maintenance. Consumers need their vehicles for mobility. So, we tend to power our way through those. What encourages us about the consumer is that even in this environment, you've got unemployment at 4.2%, you've got wage growth at 4%, so wage growth is finally keeping up or outpacing inflation. So, we feel pretty good that as consumer sentiment improves, moving forward, that you'll see some return of normalcy in terms of spending and our business will benefit from that. But the good news again is the lion's share of our business, that break-fix, essential maintenance, is pretty resilient really through all cycles.\nRobbie Ohmes: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is live.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. So, the market has grown accustomed to AutoZone growing its earnings by a double-digit clip with mid-single-digit operating income growth and the rest coming from share repurchases. It seems like your message today is that algorithm might prove elusive for the next few quarters as the headwind to our international business comes into play from FX and some of the other unique factors like LIFO. So, when is it realistic that AutoZone can get back to this double-digit EPS growth algorithm? And is it really incumbent on an acceleration in pricing that's going to both help the top-line as well as the margins moving through 2025? Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. First thing I'll say is that the long-term algo is unchanged. I mean, this is a business that we believe as we look forward will be a consistent, steady grower. It has an opportunity to expand margins that will have a ton of free cash flow at the bottom of the waterfall and we'll buy back shares and do shareholder-friendly things associated with it. In the near term, the things that you've alluded to, things like LIFO, a little bit of pressure on -- from an FX standpoint, may impact that on a quarterly basis, but that long-term algo doesn't change. I think what we're encouraged by is that the growth initiatives that we have as the macro environment improves, you'll see the acceleration in the top-line, which is key to that algo working as we move forward. So, all the things we're working on from a growth initiative standpoint will really start to show up in the results, but in this environment where particularly the consumers have been pressured, DIY has been a little bit soft, it's a little tough to print that number quarter-over-quarter as we move forward. So, we feel good about where we are, we feel good about the fundamentals of the business, the fundamentals of the industry, the fundamentals of our execution, but on a quarterly basis, it's difficult to print the algo as it has been. So, long-term, no change. Short-term, you'll certainly see some impacts from the top-line and some of these other drivers in the business.\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. Just to reiterate, I mean, there definitely will be pressure on the given quarter, but the Mexico business and the international business is an incredible business and growing. We like the profitability of that market and we like our strategies both on the international markets and our opportunities that we still have here in the U.S. So, we're happy with our strategies. Don't like the FX pressure, but we can't. That's not one we can deal with at the moment.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, the margin structure of AutoZone has evolved a bit over the years. It's now more incumbent upon the gross margin expansion to drive stable to flat overall operating margins and offset some growth in SG&A. So, if AutoZone is running into obstacles to grow its gross margin, should the market expect that it can manage its SG&A to moderate that to keep its overall operating margin flattish moving forward?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I think two things associated with that. One is we are continuing to run the gross margin play with intensity inside the company. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, our merchandising teams are doing a fantastic job of finding a way to give us expanding margins even in an environment where we haven't had an opportunity to raise retails as fast, which is a pretty significant achievement for the company. I've also said that in the middle of the P&L that to the extent that the top-lines or the gross margins don't materialize that we have the muscle and we'll make the decisions that are necessary to make sure that we're protecting our operating margins in total and that includes the things that we do on the SG&A line. What we've been able to do over the last couple of years is invest in a very disciplined way in things that are positioning us very, very well for the future in SG&A. So things like IT, payroll to improve service, the payroll that's necessary to support some of these growth initiatives, and those things are all going to pay benefits for us. So, I think the message here is no change to the algo. No outlook that suggests that operating margins are going to be on the decline here. We'll work our way through these. And as we see the top-line return and as we continue to work gross margins and work the middle of the P&L, the operating margin profile of the company is protected.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nPhil Daniele: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Baker from D.A. Davidson. Your line is live.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks guys. Two quick ones. You've alluded a little bit to pricing, competitive pricing. Can you just tell us, we know one of your competitors has been investing in price. Is that impacting the average ticket at all?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah, I would say that they -- we've heard that they're doing that. And at the end of the day, we monitor our pricing all the time. We haven't seen any radical change. I think, specifically, on the commercial side of the business, the vast majority of the share is with the WDs and that's who we focus on in our pricing strategies, and we haven't seen any material change there. And I would say that, if you ask if that's the pressure point for a lack of average ticket growth, the answer is no. The impetus for average ticket growth and retail inflation is really comes from cost. And as the cost comes in, we'll push that cost to the consumer and that's where you get some of that retail average ticket inflation. So, I would say it's not -- that is not the primary reason for the lack of inflation on ticket average. It goes back to this hyperinflation that we had since the supply chain issues of the pandemic.\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I mean, you heard me say in the past, particularly during the pandemic where we saw a pretty significant increase in ticket that inflation is a bit of our friend when it comes to retails, and that dynamic is because, as Phil alluded to, this is a very disciplined rational industry in terms of pricing. And so, even when you are looking at changes that you're making dynamically from a pricing standpoint because you're largely in a break-fix business where you don't necessarily stimulate demand from pricing -- downward pressures on pricing, you generally don't see that happening in our industry. And this industry is rational today, it's been rational for decades.\nPhil Daniele: Exactly.\nMichael Baker: Yeah. Okay. Pretty clear. One follow-up, I guess, maybe in two quick parts. You said you expect first quarter comps to be -- I think you said improving. Why? Is that based on what you're seeing quarter-to-date? And then, you also said accelerating or more store growth. Can you quantify that? How many stores -- you gave us a mega-hub number for next year. How many total stores should we expect in 2025? Thanks.\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. So, Jamere said, I think we're expecting somewhere north of 20 on the mega-hubs. As I said, they'll also be kind of back-end loaded. So, think kind of after Christmas or so will be where the vast majority of those will come in the latter part of the year. So, we like that we will reaccelerate those. We wish that we were going to be earlier in the year. They just, from a timing perspective, are going to come in the back half of the year. As far as the first quarter, what we said was we expect the Q1 to look pretty similar to the last quarter. We don't see a whole lot of -- the consumer is still under the same pressure they were back in over the summertime. The consumer confidence I think is pretty stable at the moment. We wish it would improve, but we don't see a whole lot of catalysts for it to improve. Frankly, maybe until December timeframe after the election, et cetera. So, we expect it to be pretty similar and we think it will improve. We'll get back to a normal growth average ticket growth later in the year. So that's kind of when we see things maybe having a better inflection point. We'd love for winter to get here and have a harsh winter.\nJamere Jackson: And just in terms of...\nMichael Baker: I thought you said you expect first quarter to modestly improve, so...\nPhil Daniele: Yeah, modestly improve from a [DAP] (ph) perspective. That's correct.\nMichael Baker: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question this morning is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, Jamere, you mentioned the car park as a tailwind, but since we're entering a period where new cars from 2018, 2019 are starting to come off warranty and new car sales lagged during the pandemic, just curious why you wouldn't view this as an air pocket or a headwind for the industry. Any thoughts on why that wouldn't be the case?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I think simply put, the cars are lasting longer and they're staying on the road. So, even though the SAAR has come down, you're not seeing cars go to the boneyard. So, as a result of that, the car park has continued to tick up. And you can see that from the data that's out there. I mean, the average age of a vehicle on the road has ticked up to 12.6 years and what all the data suggests based on what we know today is that it's likely going to be one or two ticks higher next year. And that's a combination of what consumer behavior is, but it's also the factor of what's happening with technology. The cars just simply last longer and you're seeing them stay in the car park much longer, which means the average household is fractionally going up a little bit more in terms of the number of vehicles that they have.\nPhil Daniele: Yeah, I think it going to kind of your air pocket. I think that did happen to some degree back in the financial crisis 2007, '08, '09, but your car -- your new car SAARs literally dipped below 10 million annually. And we haven't seen anywhere near that type of a decline in SAARs. So, I don't think it's necessarily going to be an issue. Again, we love the fact that cars are now over 12 years on average and the American consumer is driving a lot. Those are a great tailwinds for us. We like that.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That makes sense. So, maybe fewer newer cars entering the addressable market, but also fewer scraps. So that makes sense. So, just separately, when you look at your SG&A growth on a per-store basis, it was about 1% normalized, a step down from about 3% in Q4. And when you think about managing your business for 2025, could you talk about why this low-single-digit range is the right level for you, particularly in light of the investments that you're making in commercial and also in light of some of the peers stepping up to mid-single-digit to drive share gains?\nJamere Jackson: I mean, what we've said about SG&A is that we'll continue to invest in a disciplined way to support our growth initiatives. And so, to the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in things like store payroll, the work that we're continuing to do in IT to improve the customer experience and improve our AutoZoners experience, we're going to invest into that all day long. But we also very responsible in terms of how we manage that SG&A as we move forward. So, in a softer sales environment, we do the things that we need to do to make sure that we're running efficiently from an SG&A standpoint. So, it's a balanced approach. We're not hesitating to invest in growth initiatives. We haven't pulled back on any investment in growth initiatives, but we are disciplined about how we manage it when the top-line is a little bit softer.\nZach Fadem: Appreciate the time.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you. Appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Phil Daniele, CEO of AutoZone, for closing remarks.

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Before I unpack our results, I want to remind you that each year, our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. Based on the way the calendar fell this year, we had an extra week in our fiscal year and the fourth quarter is based on 17 weeks versus 16 weeks. For comparison, our same-store sales comps are based on a 16-week basis, while our total sales, EBIT, and EPS results will be discussed on a 17-week basis. As Phil has previously discussed, we reported 9% total company sales growth. On a 16-week basis, total company sales were up 2.6%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 0.2% and our international comp was up 9.9% on a constant-currency basis. Total company EBIT grew 6.1% and our EPS grew 11%. I also want to point out that we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates in this quarter. We had a 500-basis-points drag on international sales that resulted in a $32 million headwind to sales, an $8 million headwind to EBIT, and $0.32 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. We continue to deliver solid results despite the economic backdrop, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $6.2 billion and, as I just mentioned, was up 9%. For the year, our total sales were $18.5 billion, up 5.9% versus last fiscal year. Let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 10.9% to $1.7 billion. On a 16-week basis, our domestic commercial business grew 4.5%. For FY '24, our commercial sales were $4.9 billion, up 6.2% versus last year. In the quarter, sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto parts sales and 27% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,700 flat to last year as we lap new programs that we opened that are not at maturity. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 55 net new programs, finishing with 5,898 total programs. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will aggressively pursue growth in commercial, which represents a tremendous growth opportunity for our company. To support our commercial growth, we now have 109 mega-hub locations. While I mentioned a moment ago, our commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 109 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have an objective to have well north of 200 mega-hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in the local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels. On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was down 1.1% for the quarter. For all of FY '24, our DIY comp was down [0.6%] (ph). Despite the industry softness, we continue to gain share in DIY and we are well-positioned when the industry reaccelerates. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2% along with 1% ticket growth. And as we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low- to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in-line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY business has continued to gain share behind our growth initiatives. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds, we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '25. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 31 new stores in Mexico to finish with 794 stores, and 18 new stores in Brazil, ending with 127. Our same-store sales grew 9.9% on a constant-currency basis and 4.9% when taken into account foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to international, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. We're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.5%, down 21 basis points, driven primarily by an unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 32-basis-point improvement in gross margin, driven by continued improvement in merchandising margins. For Q4 last year, we had a $30 million LIFO credit, while this year, we did not have any credits. We previously said that we thought we would have approximately $10 million of LIFO credits in the quarter, which would have equated to 16 bps of higher gross margins or $0.45 a share. At year-end, we had $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L. At the moment, we are not anticipating any charges or credits to our P&L for Q1 of FY '25, as inflation has not materially impacted our LIFO inventory accounting results. I will remind you that in last year's first quarter, we booked $2 million LIFO credit. And as a reminder, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 37 basis points. On a 16-week basis, our SG&A was up 4.6%. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in-line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 6.1% versus the prior year. EBIT for FY '24 was just under $3.8 billion, up 9.1% versus the prior year, driven by top-line growth and gross margin improvement. Interest expense for the quarter was $153.2 million, up 41% from Q4 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.7 billion at Q4-end last year. We're planning interest in the $108 million range for the first quarter of FY '25 versus $91.4 million in this year -- in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.1%, and down from last year's fourth quarter of 22.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 80 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year had benefited 22 basis points. For the first quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $902 million, up 4.3% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.5 million was 6% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $51.58, up a 11% for the quarter. For FY '24, net income was $2.7 billion, up 5.3%, and earnings per share was $149.55, up 13%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $723 million in free cash flow, and for the year, we generated $1.9 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being in an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 3.7% versus Q4 last year, while total inventory increased 6.8% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-store basis, was a negative $163,000 versus negative $201,000 last year and negative $168,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 119.5% versus last year's Q4 of 124.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $711 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter-end, we had just under $2.2 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998 while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share domestically and internationally, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY '25, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so our results reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held constant for Q1 FY '25, then we expect an approximate $55 million drag on revenue, a $16 million drag on EBIT, and a $0.63 a share drag on EPS. And if rates remained at the current spot rates for the full fiscal year 2025, we would expect an approximate $265 million impact to revenues, a $90 million impact to EBIT, and a $3.64 a share impact to full year EPS. And now, I'll turn it back to Phil. Yeah, I think, we got a couple of things working in our favor. One, our merchants are doing a fantastic job driving merchandising margin improvements and negotiating with our supply base, and that team has done a tremendous job for us. So, I think, as we move forward, we'll continue to drive merch margin improvements. We have a little bit of a drag early on because we're adding a couple of DCs associated with the supply chain efforts that we have, but net-net, we think that the merchandising margin improvements will continue to power us moving forward. The one area that we're watching very closely is what's happening in the industry from a pricing standpoint, as Phil alluded to and I alluded to as well, that we're not seeing the average ticket growth. That's largely a function of what we're seeing on the inflation side. As we get some additional inflation that starts to make its way into the industry, we're looking forward to having an opportunity to push retails a little bit harder. So, a very disciplined approach, very strong merchandising margins, and we're looking forward to a pretty good outlook for FY '25. Phil always smiles when we get this question, because I own store development inside of our organization. We feel very good about what we've done, essentially what we've done over the last year or so is rebuilding our pipeline and our capabilities. Obviously, and we've talked about it here on the call, we struggled a little bit as we got through the pandemic. Everything was generally delayed during that timeframe, but the reality is that there were things that we needed to improve from an operational standpoint to really improve that pipeline. We're pretty excited about where we are on hubs and mega-hubs. We still have our plan to open 200-plus mega-hubs versus our original estimate of 110. We'll build 20-plus in FY '25 and I'm really excited about the fact that we have about 70 mega-hubs in the pipeline today, most of which are under construction. So, I feel good about the team, what we've executed on, et cetera. These are big 30,000-square-foot boxes and tough to find locations, but we've reorganized our team and doubled down on our efforts to get those boxes into the marketplace. I'm excited about what they'll contribute to our future growth prospects. And I would say, just to build on that, I mean, if you think about the growth rates, we actually believe that the DIY market has been down kind of low-single-digits because of those dynamics that Phil talked about, but also the fact that we're not seeing the same level of retail inflation. Tickets are still growing slower than the historical levels and that's put some pressure on it. So, a combination of the consumer sentiment, the fact that we are not seeing retail inflation are sort of driving that business down a little bit. But what we're excited about is the fact that we continue to execute, as Phil mentioned, I mean, we're providing great service to the customer. And as that portion of the industry reaccelerates, we'll be in great shape. And on the commercial side, I mean, as near as we can tell, I mean, commercial has been flat to declining for -- or slightly declining for a few quarters here. And if we look at what we saw this quarter, it was probably in a similar sort of zip code. So, we're excited about the fact that we've accelerated our commercial sales growth. And as we move forward, the execution on our initiatives that Phil talked about, the fact that we'll get more hubs and mega-hubs in our marketplace, all bode well for us as we move forward. Yeah, so the 53rd week is always a little bit noisy for us, just in general in terms of how allocations happen, et cetera. So, I wouldn't read much into how you think about it. I mean, overall for the total company, we had about $365 million of sales and about $87 million of EBIT associated with that extra week when you look at it on a like-for-like basis. And I wouldn't -- the margin impacts and SG&A impacts and all those things can get a little bit skewed just based on how you do allocations in the quarter. What I'll say about international and the international margins as we think about it going forward, it's a very strong business for us. Our business in Mexico has basically doubled over the last three fiscal years or so. So, given that significant revenue and EBIT impact of our international footprint, swings in FX rates are going to impact us, et cetera. The teams are doing a great job of executing and we wanted to be really transparent on what we see in terms of FX moving forward and what the margin impact is going to be going forward. Yeah, there's really two pieces. One is, we had about $40 million of LIFO credits that roll through the P&L this year, that become headwinds next year. Now depending on what happens from an inflation standpoint, we've got about $19 million of credits still to come before we go back to an unrecorded balance. So, you could offset maybe half of that $40 million benefit that you had this year on the LIFO side. So that should help you from a modeling standpoint. And then, from an FX standpoint, we try to be transparent about where the spot rates are. We're certainly not making a prediction on where FX is going to land. There are lots of things that will impact that, certainly, things that happened in the U.S. economy, things that happened in the international economies, and some of the political dynamics. So, what we wanted to do is just be really transparent about where the spot rates currently are and what the impact could potentially be on our P&L. We'll update you as we move through the year. It's been pretty volatile. You've seen a pretty significant spike probably to the tune of 20% or 25% in a very short period of time. And again, as I said, given the size of international and our P&L and the profitability of that business, it does have an impact. So, we'll be transparent and share with you exactly what we see as it rolls its way through the P&L. Just a little more on the consumer. I mean, a couple of things really stand out to us. One is, if you look at the economy just in general, I've said this for a while that you've had this sort of this two-speed world where the middle- and upper-income consumers have strong balance sheets and are continuing to spend as normal, and the lower-end is feeling the pinch, particularly in the discretionary categories. The beauty of our business is that the lion's share of our business is relatively inelastic, it's break-fix, it's essential maintenance. Consumers need their vehicles for mobility. So, we tend to power our way through those. What encourages us about the consumer is that even in this environment, you've got unemployment at 4.2%, you've got wage growth at 4%, so wage growth is finally keeping up or outpacing inflation. So, we feel pretty good that as consumer sentiment improves, moving forward, that you'll see some return of normalcy in terms of spending and our business will benefit from that. But the good news again is the lion's share of our business, that break-fix, essential maintenance, is pretty resilient really through all cycles. Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. First thing I'll say is that the long-term algo is unchanged. I mean, this is a business that we believe as we look forward will be a consistent, steady grower. It has an opportunity to expand margins that will have a ton of free cash flow at the bottom of the waterfall and we'll buy back shares and do shareholder-friendly things associated with it. In the near term, the things that you've alluded to, things like LIFO, a little bit of pressure on -- from an FX standpoint, may impact that on a quarterly basis, but that long-term algo doesn't change. I think what we're encouraged by is that the growth initiatives that we have as the macro environment improves, you'll see the acceleration in the top-line, which is key to that algo working as we move forward. So, all the things we're working on from a growth initiative standpoint will really start to show up in the results, but in this environment where particularly the consumers have been pressured, DIY has been a little bit soft, it's a little tough to print that number quarter-over-quarter as we move forward. So, we feel good about where we are, we feel good about the fundamentals of the business, the fundamentals of the industry, the fundamentals of our execution, but on a quarterly basis, it's difficult to print the algo as it has been. So, long-term, no change. Short-term, you'll certainly see some impacts from the top-line and some of these other drivers in the business. Yeah. I think two things associated with that. One is we are continuing to run the gross margin play with intensity inside the company. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, our merchandising teams are doing a fantastic job of finding a way to give us expanding margins even in an environment where we haven't had an opportunity to raise retails as fast, which is a pretty significant achievement for the company. I've also said that in the middle of the P&L that to the extent that the top-lines or the gross margins don't materialize that we have the muscle and we'll make the decisions that are necessary to make sure that we're protecting our operating margins in total and that includes the things that we do on the SG&A line. What we've been able to do over the last couple of years is invest in a very disciplined way in things that are positioning us very, very well for the future in SG&A. So things like IT, payroll to improve service, the payroll that's necessary to support some of these growth initiatives, and those things are all going to pay benefits for us. So, I think the message here is no change to the algo. No outlook that suggests that operating margins are going to be on the decline here. We'll work our way through these. And as we see the top-line return and as we continue to work gross margins and work the middle of the P&L, the operating margin profile of the company is protected. Yeah. I mean, you heard me say in the past, particularly during the pandemic where we saw a pretty significant increase in ticket that inflation is a bit of our friend when it comes to retails, and that dynamic is because, as Phil alluded to, this is a very disciplined rational industry in terms of pricing. And so, even when you are looking at changes that you're making dynamically from a pricing standpoint because you're largely in a break-fix business where you don't necessarily stimulate demand from pricing -- downward pressures on pricing, you generally don't see that happening in our industry. And this industry is rational today, it's been rational for decades. And just in terms of... Yeah. I think simply put, the cars are lasting longer and they're staying on the road. So, even though the SAAR has come down, you're not seeing cars go to the boneyard. So, as a result of that, the car park has continued to tick up. And you can see that from the data that's out there. I mean, the average age of a vehicle on the road has ticked up to 12.6 years and what all the data suggests based on what we know today is that it's likely going to be one or two ticks higher next year. And that's a combination of what consumer behavior is, but it's also the factor of what's happening with technology. The cars just simply last longer and you're seeing them stay in the car park much longer, which means the average household is fractionally going up a little bit more in terms of the number of vehicles that they have. I mean, what we've said about SG&A is that we'll continue to invest in a disciplined way to support our growth initiatives. And so, to the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in things like store payroll, the work that we're continuing to do in IT to improve the customer experience and improve our AutoZoners experience, we're going to invest into that all day long. But we also very responsible in terms of how we manage that SG&A as we move forward. So, in a softer sales environment, we do the things that we need to do to make sure that we're running efficiently from an SG&A standpoint. So, it's a balanced approach. We're not hesitating to invest in growth initiatives. We haven't pulled back on any investment in growth initiatives, but we are disciplined about how we manage it when the top-line is a little bit softer."

            "name": "Phil Daniele",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about our quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call to see them. As we begin this morning, I want to thank our more than 120,000 AutoZoners for their contributions during fiscal 2024 that resulted in our solid performance. As the first line of our pledge states, they continue putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 5.9% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 13%. As a reminder, this fiscal year had an extra week of results. So, excluding the 53rd week, our sales were up 3.8%, while our EPS was up 10.4%. In the fourth quarter, with our continued focus on what we call Wow! Customer Service, our total sales were up 9%, while EPS was up 11%. On a 16-week basis, our Q4 sales were up 2.6%, while our EPS was up 3.5%. We also delivered 1.3% total company same-store sales, domestic same-store sales growth of 0.2%, and international same-store sales up 9.9%. Our domestic commercial sales accelerated sequentially, finishing up 4.5% versus last year's Q4 of 3.9%. This is on a 16-week versus 16-week basis. We were up 10.9% on a 17-week versus 16-week basis. While our international business continued to comp up approximately 10% in local currencies, we faced a nearly 500 points of currency headwind and our reported growth rate is approximately 5%. As you know, the weaker US dollar has been a tailwind for our reported results, since we began reporting international comps last year in our fourth quarter earnings report. The stronger dollar had a meaningful impact on our reported sales, operating profit, and EPS this quarter. Jamere will update the potential impact of foreign currency on FY '25 later in the call. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in the quarter's results, what has been consistent is that we could not have achieved both this quarter's and this year's success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization. So, let me dive into our sales results. First off, I will say that our domestic DIY results were very similar to last quarter. Q4's DIY comp sales were down about 1%. The impact from the headwind on our discretionary merchandise categories drove the bulk of this decline, similar to last quarter. For our fourth quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 18% of our mix and they were down roughly 5% year-over-year, again similar to our results in previous quarters this fiscal year. We have seen this trend for the entire fiscal year and our belief is that these categories will continue to be pressured until the consumer gets some economic relief and customer confidence improves -- consumer confidence improves. With regards to our inflation impact on the DIY comp, we saw both average ticket and like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1% for the quarter. While still low versus historical norms, the growth is a good trend for us as we would expect inflation in our ticket average to be approximately 3% over time. We anticipate average ticket growth will return to historical industry growth rates as we move farther away from the hyperinflation of the last couple of years. We also saw DIY transactions count down 2%. While our industry overall sales growth rate for DIY appears to be down over the last quarter, it was very encouraging to see our market share growth in DIY. We believe we have a best-in-class offering, and this gives us confidence that when our consumers return to their historical shopping habits, we will be the beneficiaries of that upswing. Secondly, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. Simply put, it was consistent across the country as each of our 10 reporting census regions delivered approximately a 1% negative comp. Third, I will address weather and what we believe the impact was on our DIY business. We clearly saw hot weather across the U.S. this past summer. And in those markets where the weather was hot, our sales increased accordingly. However, across the majority of the country, the weather pattern was similar to the previous year and, therefore, did not have a meaningful impact on our performance. Next, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. While we reported this morning that our commercial sales were up 10.9% for the quarter, on a 16-week comparable basis to last year, our sales were up 4.5%. We were encouraged to see our U.S. commercial sales growth. This past quarter marked another quarter of sequential increases to year-over-year DIFM sales. We saw very little variation in the commercial sales across regions as the entire country was basically running at the overall sales growth rate of 4.5% on a 16-week basis. While we are encouraged by the progress we are making, we still have significant opportunities in front of us to grow market share, with improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of our Duralast brand, and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improve customer service. We are confident about our future. This quarter, inflation on a like-for-like SKU basis was essentially flat, which drove flat pricing and average ticket for commercial. We have seen pricing remain relatively flat as inflation has cooled for goods in our industry. We expect to see slightly more inflation next year, and our assumption is like-for-like SKU retail inflation will be in the low-single-digits in FY '25. For the year, we opened eight hubs and 11 mega-hubs, which is roughly half of what we did in FY '23. We are excited about the ability to resume aggressively opening these important assets in FY '25, although openings will be somewhat second-half loaded. Hubs and mega-hubs lead to comp results that grow faster than the balance of the chain and we are going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets. For our first quarter of FY '25, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to modestly improve. We expect better sales performance in Q2 and the Q3 timeframes. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends change. Before turning the call to Jamere, I would like to take a moment to discuss our international business. We were busy opening stores this quarter. Between Mexico and Brazil, we opened 49 new stores and now have 921 international stores. As you can see from our press release, our same-store sales were just under 10%. We remain committed to growing the number of stores in both Mexico and Brazil. Today, we have 13% of our store -- total store base outside of the U.S. and expect that number will continue to grow. We plan to accelerate our openings by 2028, and we are targeting around 200 international openings per year. We continue to take our U.S. store learnings and introduce them to the international store operations, and we are very excited about our future in international. In summary, we have continued to invest in making end-market inventory assortments better to drive future traffic growth and sales, enhancing our IT systems and our supply chain. In FY '25, we'll continue to ramp up our store openings, specifically our hubs and mega-hubs and drive efficiencies from our new DCs, which are expected to come online in 2025. At AutoZone, we are investing in our future growth initiatives. In FY '24, we invested more than $1 billion in CapEx and are focused on our strategic growth priorities. In FY '25, you will see more of the same. We are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically hubs and mega-hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers, distribution centers that will drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs, IT systems that will improve customer service and improve our AutoZoners' ability to help our customers. We believe that our industry is strong and we have an opportunity to grow market share domestically and internationally. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Thank you, Jamere. We're proud of our AutoZoners across the globe and the results our team delivered this past quarter. In FY '24, we focused on improving execution and driving Wow! Customer Service. We made meaningful progress and are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid, and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital to work where we'll have the biggest impact on sales. Our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say \"yes\" to our customers' needs. The top focus areas for fiscal 2025 will remain growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in our international markets. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability, flawless execution and what we call Wow! Customer Service will lead to sales growth and gains in market share. We're excited to start 2025. This time of year, we also enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this past fiscal year: $18.5 billion in sales, headed toward the $20 billion milestone; commercial sales are about to eclipse $5 billion, it wasn't that long ago we just crossed across $2 billion, that was only 2017; average weekly sales domestically of $47,000 a week, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually; our Mexico and our ALLDATA teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil has now more than 100 stores and is growing; we bought back $3.2 billion in AutoZone stock, marking $37 billion in buybacks since the start of our program back in '98. As we start our new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment and discuss our operating theme for this New Year, \"Great People, Great Service.\" I am asked frequently what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer always goes back to the same point over and over again, our AutoZoners and AutoZone's amazing culture. Our AutoZoners have built this culture. This year, we will focus on our AutoZoners like never before. We are determined to improve upon an already existing culture of service. Next week will mark the start of our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis. Just over 3,000 AutoZoners will be in Memphis to learn about our parts and products, celebrate this past year's accomplishments, as well as allowing our leadership to celebrate and recognize the best-performing store and distribution center AutoZoners. We cannot wait to have everyone here. But we can't rest on our laurels and we aren't without our challenges, that's for sure. We must make sure that every store is staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function properly, always, and we have to meet our new store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been. Fiscal 2025's top priorities will continue to be based on improving execution, and we will continue to invest in our following strategic projects: reaccelerate our new hub and mega-hub openings; effectively and efficiently open our new distribution centers and optimize our direct import facility; ramp-up our domestic and international store growth; as discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant-currency basis of 10.2%, continuing several years of very strong growth; and most importantly, reaccelerate our domestic commercial sales growth and continue to gain market share on DIY. Also this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that Ken Jaycox joined AutoZone this past quarter as our Senior Vice President, Commercial. Ken is a strong addition for us, having served most recently at U.S. Steel where he served as their Senior Vice President and Commercial Chief Officer. He has extensive experience in the B2B space and has developed and led world-class sales teams. He is a great cultural fit, and we are fortunate to have Ken join us. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering even better results. We believe in our potential for future growth. We believe in AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Yeah, it's a great question. Thanks, Simeon. I think we will sequentially improve from here. Again, I'd -- like we've talked about on the last couple of calls, I think it's a progressive improvement. I don't think it's going to be a snapback. If you look at the environment out there, the consumer is still pressured and we think that's showing up on both DIY and the commercial side of the business, but we like our strategies that we have in place as far as exactly what you said, incrementally improving the store side assortments at the satellite stores, opening up these hubs and mega-hubs, and adding inventory closer to the customers. And then, we're also working on ways to streamline customer service, specifically improving speed to customer on those harder-to-find parts. So, we like our strategy, and we think we'll continue to build from here. Thank you. Good morning, Bret. Yeah. If you talk about the cadence -- the quarter, like I said, both regionally and the cadence across the quarter were all pretty similar. If you -- the very beginning of the quarter was a little bit lighter. June was great. Some of it due to the hot weather came a little bit earlier this year. And then, when you got into July and August, it was pretty similar to last year from a weather perspective. So, you didn't see meaningful change in July and August from a comp perspective. Where it was hot, we saw all the categories take off like you would expect. So, we had a good summer. It wasn't demonstrably different than last year though. And so, that's kind of how we think about that from a quarter perspective. Sorry, what was the second part of the question? Yeah. So, on national accounts, that's a great question. We kind of think of our -- the up-and-down the street customer. We think about national accounts and then we have what we call some verticals. And I'll explain kind of how we saw performance across those segments. The up-and-down the street customer has been very resilient, been one of the best-growing segments for us. The national accounts have improved quarter-over-quarter, and part of that improvement has come from a lot of those national accounts are heavily tied towards tires and tires are not as bad as they used to be. The trends have improved. We're seeing more tire replacements, even though those customers generally, I think, are seeing down customer traffic, but tires are not the big drag that they have historically been. The one segment that has not performed very good for us and, as I say, I think it's going to make sense, it's anything related to new cars, used cars, or [buyer payer] (ph) lots. As cars change hands, there's generally an uptick in maintenance. To a used car, they may refurb and put on -- put tires on, put on new brakes, suspension items, change all the filters, do some maintenance, et cetera. And as that new customer picks up the new car, they may continue to personalize it. So, that segment of the business, which we're highly penetrated in, has not performed as well. We think as the environment and the economy improves a little bit and we see more used cars change hands and new cars being sold that will help those two segments of the business. Great question. Thank you. So, on DIY, as we said, the biggest pressure point has really been in the discretionary part categories of the business. So, think of that accessories, truck towing performance, things of that nature. That business has been pretty tough for us for at least a year. And when you look at the share gains, that sort of area is where we've seen the most challenging performance. In our maintenance categories and our failure categories on the DIY side of the business, they have been pretty resilient, but it's those headwinds from the discretionary categories that have been tough. And we frankly don't know that that's going to change too much until that our pressured consumer starts to get some economic relief and, frankly, when their confidence starts to improve a bit. On the commercial side, we believe we're still one of the fastest-growing in the industry, a little bit of a tougher comp scenario, but we believe we're growing share and we like our strategies of deploying inventory through the hub and the mega-hub assortments. And we have several strategies that are focused on improving customer service in commercial, and we're seeing really good results from those. Thank you. Good morning, Steven. Yeah. Well, again, if you compare the 16-weeks to 16-weeks, we were up 4.5% versus last year. So -- and it sequentially from the last three quarters, that's three quarters in a row of growing trend on our commercial sales. If you look at what we're focused on with the -- obviously, improving our assortments is something we do all the time. I think our merchants have done a fantastic job of improving the store-level assortments and also improving the store -- the hub and mega-hub assortments within any given market that may have one of those types of boxes. What we're focused on is utilizing deployed inventory in a given market, either in a hub or a satellite, and getting that inventory quicker to the customer at the shop level. So, we think of it in terms of time, speed to shop, how quickly can we get that inventory from wherever it may be to the shop, the fastest way to improve customer service. And as you back up to a hub or a mega-hub, the assortments get deeper, and how do we get that product to those customers faster. We've deployed quite a bit of technology over the last couple of years. We continue to leverage that technology and learn how to improve the customer service at the -- for the AutoZoners, allowing them to help the customer better, as well as getting that inventory quicker to the customer wherever that inventory maybe. And we're seeing really good results. We like the strategy. What I'll tell you is, it's dependent on having a hub and a mega-hub, which is why this strategy of having more hubs deployed with those inventory assets closer to the customer is so important. We wish we could go faster. We'll start reaccelerating those hub and mega-hubs later in the year. And then, we've got a -- as Jamere mentioned, we've got a great pipeline. We feel good about the future. We know where we want all of these big boxes to be. Of all the sites, well north of 200 of them on the mega-hub side. We know where they are. It's just a matter of negotiating and getting them open. Yeah. So, let me kind of back up, and we've talked about this a couple of different times, the historical growth rates versus what we're seeing today in ticket average. It's been fairly muted over the last year or so at around this 1% retail inflation and ticket average inflation that's been muted, both -- on both sides of the business, similar numbers that are down from historical rates. Over the long-term and I'm talking literally close, somewhere between 20 and 30 years, the industry has generally seen somewhere between 3% and 5% inflation in average ticket and around 1% to 3% decline in transactions, typically driven by inflation of parts as well as technology, enhancements in quality of the product. We believe that sometime in the near-time horizon, we would revert back to a historical growth rate on both of those metrics. What we typically see what drives inflation is mix of business -- drives ticket average is mix of business converting to higher technology parts, which generally speaking are more expensive and inflation caused by product cost. Over the last year, there hasn't been much product costs come into the system. And we all believe that that's because of -- if you look back through the pandemic years when we had the supply chain constraints, we had massive inflation in cost and we took those retails and pushed them to the consumer and we ended up with this hyperinflation. We're now lapping a lot of that and that trend starts to slow down kind of now going through the end of the year, and we would expect that inflation would come back in sometime in '25 and get back to normal. As far as tariffs, your question there that -- those sorts of things have ebbed and flowed over the years. If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer and we'll pass them through. As they turn through, we'll generally raise prices ahead of -- we know what the tariffs will be. We generally raise prices ahead of that. You get some gross margin improvement as the cost of goods turn in and then it flattens out. So, that's historically what we've done. I see no reason this industry has been very consistent on pricing and rational and we believe that all those same metrics are still in place. Gosh, I don't know -- well, that's a great question. The consumer is under much different pressure. The bottom-end consumer has been pressured for the last 20 months or so or maybe more, but it's ebbed and flowed over recessions, et cetera. Have we seen the type of inflation that we saw over the last three years? No, not -- certainly not in my lifetime. But generally speaking, in tougher economic times, people will generally defer maintenance and discretionary items early in the cycle. And then, as we get further through the cycle, they start to repair their cars because they realize a little investment today, maintaining their vehicle defers a major repair into the future. So, we think it's going to ebb and flow over time, but we feel like our execution, our improvement in execution and our strategies are the right strategies for us and we'll work over the long-term. Yeah. Just to reiterate, I mean, there definitely will be pressure on the given quarter, but the Mexico business and the international business is an incredible business and growing. We like the profitability of that market and we like our strategies both on the international markets and our opportunities that we still have here in the U.S. So, we're happy with our strategies. Don't like the FX pressure, but we can't. That's not one we can deal with at the moment. Thanks, Michael. Yeah, I would say that they -- we've heard that they're doing that. And at the end of the day, we monitor our pricing all the time. We haven't seen any radical change. I think, specifically, on the commercial side of the business, the vast majority of the share is with the WDs and that's who we focus on in our pricing strategies, and we haven't seen any material change there. And I would say that, if you ask if that's the pressure point for a lack of average ticket growth, the answer is no. The impetus for average ticket growth and retail inflation is really comes from cost. And as the cost comes in, we'll push that cost to the consumer and that's where you get some of that retail average ticket inflation. So, I would say it's not -- that is not the primary reason for the lack of inflation on ticket average. It goes back to this hyperinflation that we had since the supply chain issues of the pandemic. Exactly. Yeah. So, Jamere said, I think we're expecting somewhere north of 20 on the mega-hubs. As I said, they'll also be kind of back-end loaded. So, think kind of after Christmas or so will be where the vast majority of those will come in the latter part of the year. So, we like that we will reaccelerate those. We wish that we were going to be earlier in the year. They just, from a timing perspective, are going to come in the back half of the year. As far as the first quarter, what we said was we expect the Q1 to look pretty similar to the last quarter. We don't see a whole lot of -- the consumer is still under the same pressure they were back in over the summertime. The consumer confidence I think is pretty stable at the moment. We wish it would improve, but we don't see a whole lot of catalysts for it to improve. Frankly, maybe until December timeframe after the election, et cetera. So, we expect it to be pretty similar and we think it will improve. We'll get back to a normal growth average ticket growth later in the year. So that's kind of when we see things maybe having a better inflection point. We'd love for winter to get here and have a harsh winter. Yeah, modestly improve from a [DAP] (ph) perspective. That's correct. Yeah, I think it going to kind of your air pocket. I think that did happen to some degree back in the financial crisis 2007, '08, '09, but your car -- your new car SAARs literally dipped below 10 million annually. And we haven't seen anywhere near that type of a decline in SAARs. So, I don't think it's necessarily going to be an issue. Again, we love the fact that cars are now over 12 years on average and the American consumer is driving a lot. Those are a great tailwinds for us. We like that. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Thank you, everyone, for the questions today. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We were excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed into the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on flawless execution and Wow! Customer Service and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call."

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our Web site www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin the call, I want to say thank you to our more than 120,000 AutoZoners across all of our businesses for delivering solid earnings results in the face of a difficult macro environment. With our continued focus on providing what we call WOW! Customer Service, our AutoZoners delivered our total sales increase of 3.5%, total company same store sales up 1.9% and on a constant currency basis, total company same store sales of 0.9%. Also, our operating profit grew 4.9% while our earnings per share grew 7.5%. In spite of our lower than planned sales, we managed our business well and we were able to deliver bottom line results that continued to build on the phenomenal results we've had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere who helped us achieve this quarter's growth. Your dedication to delivering on our commitment of WOW! Customer Service is always inspiring. Before I begin my comments on our third quarter sales, as a reminder, the backdrop to this quarter and every third quarter of our fiscal year includes tax refund season. It is roughly a $300 billion influx of cash to our customers. It begins around Valentine's Day and generally last four to six weeks. These dollars matter to our customers and meaningfully impact their shopping patterns in our stores. This year, refund dollars ended up slightly versus the previous year. However, February refund flows were lower than expected and negatively impacted the first three weeks of the quarter's domestic same store sales. While the refund flows did catch up later in the later weeks, we felt the delayed refunds were a drag on our sales results through February and early March, similar to what you may have heard from other retailers. Secondly, the weather was unfortunately cooler and wetter than we had expected and planned, especially in the Northeast and the Midwest markets. As a result, sales in these markets were noticeably below the remaining markets with this pattern more pronounced over the last eight weeks of our 12 week quarter. Again, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives hard part failures and accelerates maintenance over time, thereby driving higher sales. So on balance, we believe this quarter's sales were impacted negatively by the late start of the tax refund season, while the last eight weeks were impacted by cooler than weather -- than we had planned. Despite these headwinds, we also had many successes. We gained share in our retail business, and we believe we continue to gain share in commercial. We continue to be encouraged by our supply chain initiatives. The construction of our two new domestic DCs are on track for Q2 FY25 opening as well as our continued forward deployment of inventory across both our hubs and our mega hubs. We continue to see progress on our initiatives within our domestic commercial business that give us confidence about accelerated growth. While it is prudent for us to remain cautious on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe sales will accelerate over time. We are excited about our commercial initiatives that are providing deeper parts coverage closer to the customer with faster delivery times, improving customer service and thereby, driving sales. For the third quarter, our total company same store sales were 0.9% on a constant currency basis. As we have mentioned, international has become a more important part of our growth story in this quarter. We delivered another strong quarter, up over 9.3% on a constant currency basis. We continue to be very encouraged with both our short term and long term growth prospects we have internationally and we plan to accelerate new store openings and drive operational improvements in these markets over the next several years. Our domestic same store sales were flat this quarter compared to up 0.3% last quarter and up 1.9% in Q3 of last year. As I mentioned previously, we believe our sales were impacted in the first four weeks of the quarter by the delayed tax refund season and the last eight weeks by the mild wet weather pattern across much of the US. Domestically, we ran a negative 0.7% comp across the first four weeks and collectively across the last eight weeks of plus 0.3% comp. Our commercial business grew 3.3% against last year's Q3 growth of 6.3%. Our commercial results were higher in the first eight weeks and relatively consistent, but slightly lower the last four weeks. The last four weeks comparison were the most difficult of the quarter. Weather impact was more pronounced in the last eight weeks of the quarter and it was during this time that the regional performance disparities became more apparent. The Northeast and the Midwest underperformed the remainder of the country by close to 200 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter. Commercial transaction counts were up and were partially offset by slightly negative ticket growth, which was attributable to similarly negative inflation on a same SKU basis. We opened 20 net new commercial programs and now have commercial in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales for Q3. Despite the choppiness in our commercial sales results this quarter, we are planning for a stronger growth rate in Q4 behind continued execution of our growth initiatives and somewhat easier comparisons. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we've been working on over time, improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality parts and products and technology enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are encouraged by our recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times. As we roll these initiatives to the majority of the chain, we are anticipating faster growth and accelerated share gains. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 1% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of 0.6%. DIY ran negative 2% across the first four weeks of the quarter, positive 0.1% the second four week segment and negative 0.1% comp over the last four weeks. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwestern markets underperformed the remainder of the country by approximately 100 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter similar to our commercial business. Heading into the fourth quarter, we feel weather should be less volatile and we are planning accordingly. Regarding our merchandise categories in the DIY business, our sales floor categories, and particularly discretionary categories, underperformed hard parts. We also saw several seasonal merchandise categories and weather sensitive hard part categories being off our planned results due to the cooler than expected weather. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down approximately 2% while our ticket average was up only 1%. We expect our average ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from the higher inflation from the last couple of years. We attribute our previously mentioned DIY share gains to improve customer service levels in our stores and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels, driven by most of our vendor partners returning to more normalized operations, meaning recovering from the pandemic sales surge and supply chain disruptions. As we look forward, we are continuing to focus on flawless execution and delivering WOW! Customer Service will drive our accelerated sales growth in our domestic business. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 872 stores opened internationally or 12% of our store base, this business had yet again impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our key objectives for fiscal year 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and we believe our improved customer service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We are also focused on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability versus our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on adding capacity to our distribution network. We have two distribution centers that are nearing completion in the US, one in Chao Chilla, California, and the other in New Kent, Virginia. We are also very close to completing the expansion of our Tapeje Mexico DC. And last quarter, we broke ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey, Mexico DC. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed, expanded parts availability and improved efficiencies. These capacity expansions will underpin our future growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Phil. And good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid third quarter with 3.5% total company sales growth, flat domestic comp growth, a 9.3% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 4.9% increase in EBIT and a 7.5% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 3.5%. And let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.3% to just under $1.2 billion and were up 9.6% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,400, down 2.4% versus last year's $16,800. Now as a reminder, we have added over 300 new programs over the last 12 months and these new programs are diluting the overall sales per program. We are, however, extremely pleased that these programs are maturing significantly faster than our historical performance and position us well for the future. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we\u2019re building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 20 net new programs, finishing with 5,843 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and look to gain share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth in the highly fragmented commercial market, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 103 mega hub locations with two net new mega hub opened in Q3. Our mega hub continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs, and grew more than 3 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q3. Our mega hub typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs, drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone store is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hub for the foreseeable future, and we expect to open well north of 200 mega hub at full build-out. These assets are key to our growth plans. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was down 1% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down approximately 2%, offset by approximately 1% ticket growth. Overt time, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q3, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, miles driven back to prepandemic levels, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same store sales grew an impressive 18.1% on an actual basis and 9.3% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores in Mexico to finish with 763 stores, and one store in Brazil ending with 109. We remain committed to international. And given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.5%, up 102 basis points, driven by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 15 basis points from a noncash $24 million LIFO credit in this quarter versus a $17 million LIFO credit in Q3 of last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 87 basis point improvement in gross margin. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have done an exceptional job of driving gross margin improvement this year. I will point out that we now have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect this credit balance to reverse over the next couple of quarters. We're currently modeling approximately $10 million in LIFO credits for Q4 based on the deflation experienced this past year. This compares to $30 million LIFO credit we had in Q4 last year, which means we would have a $20 million net headwind from LIFO in gross profit. As I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year\u2019s Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 76 basis points. On a same store basis, SG&A grew 3.3% as we continue to invest in initiatives that drive speed, productivity and improve customer service. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $900 million, up 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million, up 41% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.3 billion in Q3 last year. We are planning interest in the $148 million range for the fourth quarter versus $109 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curb are driving this increase, along with the extra week that we will have in this year's fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.1% and up from last year's third quarter of 17.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 479 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 595 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $652 million, up 0.6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.8 million was 6.4% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of slightly higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $36.69, up 7.5% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $434 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I will also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of each of our fiscal years. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory was up 7.9%, driven by a combination of inventory per store growth to support our growth initiatives, improvements in in-stock levels along with new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was $168,000 negative versus $215,000 negative last year and negative $164,000 negative last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 119.7% versus last year's 126.5%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $735 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target of 2.5 times and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and free cash flow and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to Q4, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a steady DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Phil.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this last quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2024, but we must continue to focus on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting customer first are what defines us. We are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital investments where they matter most, our stores, distribution centers, and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority has been enhanced execution. We are making good progress. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on our new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of plus 9.3%, continuing several years of strong growth. While I mentioned all these investments in FY24, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. We continue to believe we have a solid plan in place for growth for the foreseeable future. We know our focus on parts availability and WOW! Customer Service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering the results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Could you talk a little bit about the cadence? You commented at the end of the quarter in the commercial business ended a bit softer and obviously very early in Q4, but could you give us any color sort of as we've trended sequentially into the fourth?\nPhil Daniele: The commercial business, like we said, has been choppy. The last four weeks were the more difficult compares for the quarter. And as we said several times, I hate being the weatherman, but this particular spring has been challenging for us from a wet and cooler season. And typically, in the latter half of the quarter, we start seeing some improved performance around the hot weather categories like AC chemicals and AC hard parts and battery sales, et cetera, and we just didn't get that through the last several weeks of the quarter.\nBret Jordan: And then I guess on a calendar year basis, could you just maybe give us some color where you see inflation in pricing for your mix as the compares, I guess, gets\u2026\nPhil Daniele: On the inflation front, that has definitely been challenging as we've come off several years of hyperinflation, if you will, at our average unit retail on both the DIY side and the commercial side, frankly. I suspect the average unit retail same-SKU inflation would get back to more normal growth levels as we move further and further away from the inflation that we had over the previous years. Now those inflation numbers start to come back as we get in the later quarters of the calendar year, and I suspect they'll return to more normalized levels over time.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristian Carlino: It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. First question on gross margin. Supply chain crisis aside, you've grown the commercial business pretty considerably over the past couple of years. So could you speak to, I guess, the degree of vendor rebates you've yet to receive and how long you should benefit from this catch-up period for all the growth that you've had since prior to the pandemic?\nJamere Jackson: Certainly, our gross margins, as it relates to our relationship with vendors, has an opportunity improved. As Phil mentioned previously, we are coming off a period of significant hyperinflation, particularly in the areas like flat -- freight. Quite frankly, we saw snarls across the majority of the supply chain. And it impacted them from the standpoint of having higher labor costs, higher input costs in total. So we're starting to see that abate and that's given us an opportunity to go and negotiate for some deflation as we move forward. We're still in early innings there. And I wouldn't say that all of the inflationary pressures have abated but we're certainly in a much better position today than we were a year ago.\nChristian Carlino: And then now that you're starting to lap some of the earlier signs of maintenance deferral at some of the tire centers, are you starting to see trends improve with that cohort of customers? And just broadly, could you speak to the performance at like the national accounts, the tire centers, the buy here, pay here dealers and then the up and down the [indiscernible]?\nPhil Daniele: I would say if you kind of broke apart those segments that you just talked about, probably the most challenged group of customers or customers that are -- drive their repair revenue from tires. Tires have definitely been a pressure point. I think that downward trend on tires has probably flattened out a little bit. But I still think the tire segment, in particular, is under some pressure and has been for quite a while. On your other segment of customers, the buy here, pay here lot and used car centers, those have been more challenged as well. You think about there was tons of used cars that were sold over the last two years or so, and I think that's just been slower. Also, as the consumers under a little bit more economic pressure due to inflation, not just in our category but across all of retail and across life at the moment, I think there's more pressure on some of those bigger ticket items like tires. New tires is a pretty big purchase for a customer.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on mega hubs. Can you share some math on them? What -- you mentioned 200 over time, can you tell us year-over-year how many should we see per year? And then can you frame the one year lift from them, please?\nJamere Jackson: So certainly, from a mega hub standpoint, we're pretty excited about our future there. As we've announced, we'll likely have over 200 mega hubs at full build-out. Last year, we opened 20, we're likely going to open less than that this year. And we've got work to do. But our pipeline is very strong and our pipeline is robust as we look into FY25. So we're going to go as fast as we possibly can. These are big boxes and difficult to find places. But we've done a really good job and worked really hard to fill up that pipeline and you'll start to see that accelerate as we move into FY25 and beyond.\nPhil Daniele: Hubs are up -- I'll just add on. Hubs are -- these have been great stores for us. I think looking over history, we thought we'd have 30 to 40 of these things in various markets. And now we see line of sight to, like Jamere said, well north of 200 mega hubs. And the hubs are still an important part of our strategy as well, which has slightly less SKU count -- well, 30,000 to 40,000 less SKUs than a mega hub, but both of those store bases are great for us. They help significantly on the commercial side of the business and they lift the DIY market as well. So they're great assets for us and performed better than our normal stores.\nSimeon Gutman: And then can I ask -- I know you don't give forward guidance, in thinking about fiscal '25, the first half and the second half. Are you -- is it fair to think that there's -- not a hockey stick, but it will be second half weighted? In other words, the top line backdrop improves mildly, hopefully from weather, but you are going to lap some big gross margin gains core, non-LIFO while you'll need the top line to lever the expenses. So it looks like you could see some second half weighting in next year. Curious if that's -- some thoughts on sequencing for next year.\nPhil Daniele: Yes, like you said, we don't give guidance, but here's some things that I'll tell you that I'm excited about. One is weather has been challenging. And we -- I think over summer -- summer is going to heat up, we should get some -- the merchandise categories and mix and things of that nature will help our sales as we move a little bit forward. And although slower than we'd like, our commercial initiatives are working and we think those will continue to mature over time. And in a segment where we're underpenetrated in share, below 5% share on the commercial business, we think we have ample opportunity to continue to grow over time with improved service, improved hard part and expanded part availability and better service and delivery on the -- based on the things we talked about, parts investments, mega hub investments and technology investments that will grow our sales. But it won't be -- it's not going to be a hockey stick that turns around in six weeks or something, it's going to take time.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: I wanted to follow up on inflation, because it sounds like it was still across the box slightly positive in the quarter. And -- but I think I heard in commercial that it was same SKU, slightly negative. So could you just give us a little more of the detail on that?\nJamere Jackson: I think two things from an inflation standpoint. Number one, the backdrop is we're coming off a period of significantly more inflation last year. So as we look at this year and look at that impact on our ticket growth, our ticket growth is lower than it's been historically. And quite frankly, that's had an impact on the top line growth. You've heard me say a number of times that while hyperinflation is difficult from a cost standpoint. From a top line standpoint, inflation has been our fronted, and we just don't have that tailwind right now. We do expect inflation to normalize over time but the high freight cost that we had and the significant inflation that we had in the industry, it's just not there right now. And this industry has been very disciplined about passing that inflation through but also in times where the inflation is not there, we've also been disciplined about the pace with which retails are raised. So we feel pretty good with where we are in total. We think inflation is going to return. But right now, it's running significantly lower than it was a year ago and lower than what we've seen historically.\nGreg Melich: And just to be clear, in the quarter, it was zero?\nJamere Jackson: Yes, we saw ticket growth across the business being very muted in the quarter and we're seeing some inflation in certain categories and other categories we're seeing hardly any inflation. And as we manage our way through that, we've just got to make sure that we're pricing dynamically to price for inflation where we see it and in places where you don't see it. Obviously, we're being disciplined like this industry has been for a really long time.\nGreg Melich: So still discipline and you expect it to normalize, but right now, it's not, it's on the\u2026\nJamere Jackson: Yes, it's pretty muted right now.\nGreg Melich: And then my follow-up was just to understand a little bit more about the consumer trends. I know you've talked in the past that we really haven't seen trade down on the DIY side at all. I'm just curious if that started to show up as a way. I think you mentioned maybe fewer items in the basket. Could you just double click on that a little bit?\nPhil Daniele: I think there's a couple of things going on with -- if you kind of think about average ticket, some of it, frankly, has been mix of category, and I'll talk about it in a couple of different ways. One is highly discretionary items have been challenged for a while. Some of those have a great ticket. There's probably slightly fewer pieces in the basket. But I think some of that has been driven by the environment and the weather. Big jobs like air conditioning, if you will, those have been definitely muted in the spring time. Those are big jobs that have big tickets, multiple parts in them. When it rains, you're probably going to sell two wiper blades and when it's nice, people decide to do a tune up, you may have all kinds of filters that have significantly more parts transactions -- pieces per transaction in them. So I think ticket average will improve. It's not going to be improved based on hyper inflation like we've had over the last couple of years. But I do believe it will improve as we move through the summertime and get a better mix of product as we move through some of this more challenging weather scenario.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: Given the slowdown in sales that obviously we're talking about, is there anything else you guys think you can do to accelerate the sales trends, or is it just a matter of executing the way you can and you need the broader environment to improve? And then kind of part two of this is, is there a point at some stage where if sales stayed sluggish, does it potentially tempt you to go through another round of price investments? I know that wasn't the original intent, but a long period of -- so their sales could potentially raise that [temptation], I would think.\nPhil Daniele: Let me start with kind of your first -- the first part of your question. Are there things that we can do to improve? The answer is yes. We're in the process now of doubling down on customer service and execution. And on the commercial side, we're continuing on both sides. We're continuing to invest in hard parts coverage and hubs and mega hubs. Those drive sales. On the commercial side, we continue to invest in ways to service the customer better and faster and we like those initiatives that we have. So I think those help to improve our sales execution, if you will. The second part of the question\u2026\nJamere Jackson: The second part is on pricing. From a pricing standpoint, as I mentioned before, we've been very disciplined on pricing. And we executed around the pricing initiatives a couple of years and it helped us grow our shares and improve our units. We like where we're priced today. And we don't see the need to go move the needle on pricing as a way to go accelerate sales growth. I'll just remind you that the lion's share of the demand in this business is relatively inelastic. So this industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we continue to see that being the case. And to Phil's point, I mean, we're committed and doubling down on our growth initiatives. It's improving the quality of our parts, it's expanding the assortments with mega hubs, it's improving delivery times, leveraging technologies, being competitive on pricing, all those are the kinds of things that are driving our business as we move forward, and we're pretty excited about the future.\nPhil Daniele: Our pricing strategy\u2019s on both DIY, we like where we are and we believe we have the right strategies on both sides of the business. We made those investments several years ago to rightsize those strategies. The industry has been very disciplined on pricing over a long period of time, and we don't see that changing.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: I just wanted to clarify. I think you mentioned in the prepared comments a mention of store growth. And I wondered if that was more of a domestic comment versus international comment? Should we see an acceleration of the store openings here? And we wondered if just with the sheer amount of growth you've seen over the last few years, do you think some of the demand weakness that you're seeing is just due to the sheer volume of what your current store base is handling?\nJamere Jackson: We've talked several quarters ago about our aspirations to expand and accelerate our store growth in the back half of the decade. We historically have built about 150 stores, give or take, a few in domestically. And we think that we can significantly expand that number as we move forward. The drivers there, obviously, are the growth opportunities that we see in DIY but also a significant growth opportunity in commercial. And as we look at that, along with the expanded trade areas in the US, there's an opportunity for us to expand our business domestically. And we're going to do that by accelerating our store growth as we move through the balance of the decade. And then internationally, we've been extremely pleased with what we've seen in Mexico, and we like the growth prospects that we've seen in Brazil. And you've seen what we've posted in terms of same store sales comp growth now for several quarters. And there's an opportunity for us to go faster there as well. So that accelerated store growth is certainly a part of our future growth strategy, and it will help us become a faster growing business as we move forward. And then your comment about the capacity of our stores. I mean one of the things that we've done over time is we've continued to optimize the footprint of our satellite stores and then augment that with what we've done with hubs and mega hubs to jam more parts in a local market closer to customers. It's an important part of the growth strategy, both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward, which is one of the reasons why we talked about expanding the number of mega hubs that we have and our mega hub count will be north of 200 at full build-out.\nPhil Daniele: We just wish they'd come faster. Those -- building new stores takes -- it's a long tail from the time you sign a contract to the time we actually open the doors and start selling parts out of them. It just takes longer than we'd like.\nOperator: Your next question is from Seth Sigman with Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: A couple of follow-ups from my side. So when I look at the gap between your DIY business and the commercial business, it just seems narrower than it's been in the past, certainly pre-pandemic and that's been happening in the last couple of quarters. And if you look at DIY down 1%, it's actually not that different than the range we've seen in the past. So it's really commercial at this lower run rate. I know there's a lot of moving pieces here, but it's more of a macro question, right? Do you think that the commercial end customer is just slowing more? And maybe that's deferral, maybe that's trading down, I'm not sure, but I guess that's really what we're trying to figure out. Is that is that commercial end customer that may be more middle income consumer trading down a little bit more?\nPhil Daniele: Yes, that's tough to figure out exactly what's going on in commercial when you you start talking about how is the customer migrating up or down the cost curve, if you will. We don't get near the segmentation on the commercial side that we do on the DIY side and the retail side of the business. But is the customer trading down, I think if you look at some of the segments that we have, that are more challenged, thinking tires, right? Tire purchase could be well north of $1,000 for a customer. Those -- that segment has been challenged for sure. Some of the new car and used car dealer segments have been a little more challenged, partly because I think they're not selling as many units. So those two segments have been challenged. So if you think are customers migrating down because of bigger jobs or down the good, better, best column, I think that's probably true that a customer may -- they may have normally taken a car to an OE dealer, do they then migrate to a Firestone or something of that nature, and do they migrate to the UDS customer or do the job themselves. I think you could see that but it's very hard to understand how customers move on the commercial side of the business.\nJamere Jackson: And I think part of that, as we think of the commercial market, in general, that's why we've been focused on this notion that we're roughly a five share in what's approaching $100 billion market. Despite the fact that big ticket is pressured across really all of retail and certainly, a big ticket purchase in auto parts is not immune to those dynamics. I mean we still have an opportunity to grow significantly in commercial and an opportunity to grow significantly faster. And so all the things that Phil talked about in terms of our initiatives are the things that we're focused on. And if we do those things and execute on them, then that gives us an opportunity to really accelerate our commercial growth as we move forward.\nSeth Sigman: And just on that last point around accelerating commercial, you mentioned a number of initiatives around service and delivery. Can you just help us better understand operationally what is actually changing, are we adding people, are we adding routes and just how to think about that. And it sounds like you've had some success early on in some of the markets where you have deployed some of these changes. Any sense on the lift they're seeing there that gives you that confidence?\nPhil Daniele: I think we are seeing success. Again, still relatively small in our rollout and that rollout is not very mature at the moment. But we're leveraging some technology, leveraging the technology to handhelds and other technology in our stores to be smarter about how we deliver and where we deliver a part from. We're ultimately able to get the part to the shop faster than we were previously and we're leveraging all of the assets we have in the local market to get those parts to a customer faster, and we like the results that we're seeing. We believe that as we roll these out, our sales will improve in those markets. And ultimately, we'll provide better customer service and gain new customers as well as share of wallet with existing customers.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I have, I know that we've already had a number of questions on commercial, so I apologize also asking about commercial. But just in the near term, if I heard the prepared comments correctly, it sounded like you expected a bit of a strength in here into the end of fiscal '24, the fourth period. So the question I have is, as you look at the business, I think comparisons do get easier. But are there specific sort of say, building blocks, which could help to strengthen the business here in the very near term?\nJamere Jackson: I think you got two dynamics. One, as you mentioned before, is that the comparisons do get a little bit easier in the fourth quarter if you look at our grow-over numbers. But the second one is just the initiatives that Phil talked about. I mean we've been really focused on jamming more parts in the local markets and we've done a great job of doing that, and that's paying dividends for us. And then we've been focused on service and delivery speeds. And if we can win the game in terms of parts availability with jamming those parts in the local market and we can get them to the customer faster, those are things that are going to drive our business as we move forward. So again, we're excited about where we are and excited about the opportunity to accelerate our growth as we move forward. There are always macro challenges that you have to fight your way through and big ticket is pressured. But you combine the fact that we're underpenetrated, we've got a full slate of growth initiatives in place, those are the things that get us excited about the future.\nBrian Nagel: My follow-up, again, it's also a follow-up. But just with respect to the consumer, I mean, look, you operate in a unique part of retail. A lot of the spend that happens at your stores is not necessarily discretionary, but there's a lot of chatter out there right now across consumer about maybe some incremental pressures on the lower income consumer. So the question is, are you seeing that -- as you look at your business and the data that\u2019s available to you, are you seeing clearly or somewhat clearly signs of incremental pressure on this core consumer that's affected their shopping patterns?\nPhil Daniele: I think big ticket, I think, has been a challenge for the consumer in all of retail, not just us. Like you said, big pieces of our business are break fix, starter, alternator, battery, your car is down, you've got to fix it. And those tickets, while they're large, they're not -- it's not thousands of dollars, it's -- a starter and an alternator could be a couple of hundred bucks. Certainly puts pressure on the low end consumer to have to have that money come out of pocket and they're under pressure. But discretionary categories have been under pressure for, frankly, quite some time. They all exploded during the pandemic when there was a lot of money in the consumer's pocket. And they've certainly been more challenged over the last 18 to 24 months and that continues. But maintenance items, I think as customers get more cash strapped, they look at -- if I take care of my car, I know that it will perform better and save me money in the long run. So maintenance items have a tendency to start to trickle up over time. And then the failure items, if you're going to get the car back on the road, you've got to purchase it. We don't have a lot of good, better, best categories. We have some in brakes and a couple of other categories, but that's not a big piece of our business. The vast majority of our sales are on application parts that have -- you have one choice and the customer buys that part to get their car back on the road. And we think that will continue.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Phil, how would you compare and contrast this year for the aftermarket to 2017, which was the last year of challenged trends within the industry? And in your mind, is it really just a function of more cooperative weather that will drive an acceleration for the industry from here or do you think something else needs to happen in order for the backdrop to be more favorable?\nPhil Daniele: It's a great question, I was wondering when the tough weather questions from a winter perspective would come up, and that was kind of that 16%, 17% range you're talking about. It's a great question. It's frankly one we talk about internally all the time. We've had a pretty soft winter weather pattern for the last two years. And when I kind of look across the country, this winter pattern, we got some pretty good weather from a precipitation, snow and temperatures in the Midwest. We got very soft weather patterns relative to driving, break fix part failures on the Eastern seaboard. Wasn't a lot of snow in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., and we didn't have a lot of cold temperatures in those markets. And those typically have meant undercar and brake categories performed very well when you have those types of seasonal patterns. We didn't get that this year and frankly, didn't get it last year. So it's a little undetermined what happens in a long period of time where you haven't had those weather patterns with categories in that half of the country. So I think that is yet to be seen. We don't have the inflation that we had probably back in '17, '18 and frankly, over the last two years to be a benefit. But I do think we'll get a better mix of categories going into the summer selling season than we've had in Q3. So I don't know if I'm really answering your question. I think that's yet to be seen and I think it will prove out over the next four months or so.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is on the underlying gross margin trend outside of the LIFO benefit. It sounds like the LIFO could be about a $20 million drag in 4Q. How much more room do you have to improve the underlying gross margin to offset that type of headwind that you're going to experience, especially as you move into next year where comps could remain uncertain and the market is still expecting double digit EPS growth?\nJamere Jackson: So what I'll say is we've run the gross margin play with intensity and our merchandising teams and our supply chain teams have done a fantastic job. You saw last quarter, we had -- this past quarter, we had almost 90 basis points of margin improvement strictly from what we're doing on the merchandising side and what we're doing with the supply chain. I wouldn't suggest that those numbers are going to be as high as we move forward. We are coming out of a period where we had some pretty significant inflation that we got some deflation. And as we mentioned a little bit earlier, we're not getting the ticket necessarily to help us from a gross margin standpoint. So that will be muted some. But we believe that we'll have the potential to offset most, if not all, of the pressure that you see from a LIFO standpoint.\nOperator: Your final question for today is from Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen.\nMax Rakhlenko: So first, on the speed initiative, can you discuss the pace of the rollout? And when we think -- when we should think that it will be in majority or all of the markets that you have mega hubs in?\nPhil Daniele: We've been working on this for probably a year, year and half, and we started seeing the results that we really liked earlier this year and started ramping it up. We're probably in the middle innings, if you will, of rolling that out to our stores, we've got -- in our networks. We've got some more to go and we'll continue to add incremental stores as we move through the process. But I would say we're in middle innings. We do believe that as we roll this out, again, we believe we get better customer service, faster time to shop. And we believe with that better customer service, we'll gain new customers and grow share of wallet. It won't be an immediate snap but we like the efforts and the growth that we're seeing in those markets.\nMax Rakhlenko: And then just as a follow-up, on the slower mega hubs openings, is that more structural, is it tougher to find boxes in the right areas or is it about execution opportunities on your end? And then it does sound like that the opening should start to accelerate in the next few quarters. Is that right?\nJamere Jackson: The openings will definitely accelerate, and Phil has sort of smiled at me because I own store development as part of my finance responsibilities. And so this is one of my primary objectives for this year. They are big boxes in hard-to-find locations. We've been working through what we need to do from an execution standpoint. I will say it's anybody that's doing new store construction across the business know how challenging the market has been over the last couple of years or so. But we've worked our way through a lot of those challenges this fiscal year. We like the pipeline that we've built and we expect to see that accelerate as we move into FY25.\nPhil Daniele: And I think the good thing is we know exactly where we want these stores in every metro market or adding multiples to a given city or an individual market that may have a smaller number of stores. We know where we want to be. We want to make sure we get them at the right distance from our current locations. And they've got to have good routes so they're easily accessible to the other markets. And then you got to find the spot that is a great retail location and a great place to do to fulfill and get these expanded parts to our shops and our stores fast. And it's just -- it takes time. We'd love to go faster because they're great boxes for us and they know -- they help us on both DIY and commercial.\nMax Rakhlenko: That\u2019s great. Appreciate all the color and best regards.\nPhil Daniele: Great, thank you. Okay. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year but will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics, and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, I ask that we all remember our country's heroes both past and present. We owe these great Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you again for participating in today's call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Phil. And good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid third quarter with 3.5% total company sales growth, flat domestic comp growth, a 9.3% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 4.9% increase in EBIT and a 7.5% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 3.5%. And let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.3% to just under $1.2 billion and were up 9.6% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,400, down 2.4% versus last year's $16,800. Now as a reminder, we have added over 300 new programs over the last 12 months and these new programs are diluting the overall sales per program. We are, however, extremely pleased that these programs are maturing significantly faster than our historical performance and position us well for the future. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 20 net new programs, finishing with 5,843 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and look to gain share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth in the highly fragmented commercial market, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 103 mega hub locations with two net new mega hub opened in Q3. Our mega hub continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs, and grew more than 3 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q3. Our mega hub typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs, drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone store is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hub for the foreseeable future, and we expect to open well north of 200 mega hub at full build-out. These assets are key to our growth plans. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was down 1% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down approximately 2%, offset by approximately 1% ticket growth. Overt time, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q3, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, miles driven back to prepandemic levels, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same store sales grew an impressive 18.1% on an actual basis and 9.3% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores in Mexico to finish with 763 stores, and one store in Brazil ending with 109. We remain committed to international. And given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.5%, up 102 basis points, driven by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 15 basis points from a noncash $24 million LIFO credit in this quarter versus a $17 million LIFO credit in Q3 of last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 87 basis point improvement in gross margin. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have done an exceptional job of driving gross margin improvement this year. I will point out that we now have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect this credit balance to reverse over the next couple of quarters. We're currently modeling approximately $10 million in LIFO credits for Q4 based on the deflation experienced this past year. This compares to $30 million LIFO credit we had in Q4 last year, which means we would have a $20 million net headwind from LIFO in gross profit. As I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year's Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 76 basis points. On a same store basis, SG&A grew 3.3% as we continue to invest in initiatives that drive speed, productivity and improve customer service. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $900 million, up 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million, up 41% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.3 billion in Q3 last year. We are planning interest in the $148 million range for the fourth quarter versus $109 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curb are driving this increase, along with the extra week that we will have in this year's fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.1% and up from last year's third quarter of 17.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 479 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 595 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $652 million, up 0.6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.8 million was 6.4% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of slightly higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $36.69, up 7.5% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $434 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I will also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of each of our fiscal years. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory was up 7.9%, driven by a combination of inventory per store growth to support our growth initiatives, improvements in in-stock levels along with new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was $168,000 negative versus $215,000 negative last year and negative $164,000 negative last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 119.7% versus last year's 126.5%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $735 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target of 2.5 times and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and free cash flow and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to Q4, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a steady DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Phil. Certainly, our gross margins, as it relates to our relationship with vendors, has an opportunity improved. As Phil mentioned previously, we are coming off a period of significant hyperinflation, particularly in the areas like flat -- freight. Quite frankly, we saw snarls across the majority of the supply chain. And it impacted them from the standpoint of having higher labor costs, higher input costs in total. So we're starting to see that abate and that's given us an opportunity to go and negotiate for some deflation as we move forward. We're still in early innings there. And I wouldn't say that all of the inflationary pressures have abated but we're certainly in a much better position today than we were a year ago. So certainly, from a mega hub standpoint, we're pretty excited about our future there. As we've announced, we'll likely have over 200 mega hubs at full build-out. Last year, we opened 20, we're likely going to open less than that this year. And we've got work to do. But our pipeline is very strong and our pipeline is robust as we look into FY25. So we're going to go as fast as we possibly can. These are big boxes and difficult to find places. But we've done a really good job and worked really hard to fill up that pipeline and you'll start to see that accelerate as we move into FY25 and beyond. I think two things from an inflation standpoint. Number one, the backdrop is we're coming off a period of significantly more inflation last year. So as we look at this year and look at that impact on our ticket growth, our ticket growth is lower than it's been historically. And quite frankly, that's had an impact on the top line growth. You've heard me say a number of times that while hyperinflation is difficult from a cost standpoint. From a top line standpoint, inflation has been our fronted, and we just don't have that tailwind right now. We do expect inflation to normalize over time but the high freight cost that we had and the significant inflation that we had in the industry, it's just not there right now. And this industry has been very disciplined about passing that inflation through but also in times where the inflation is not there, we've also been disciplined about the pace with which retails are raised. So we feel pretty good with where we are in total. We think inflation is going to return. But right now, it's running significantly lower than it was a year ago and lower than what we've seen historically. Yes, we saw ticket growth across the business being very muted in the quarter and we're seeing some inflation in certain categories and other categories we're seeing hardly any inflation. And as we manage our way through that, we've just got to make sure that we're pricing dynamically to price for inflation where we see it and in places where you don't see it. Obviously, we're being disciplined like this industry has been for a really long time. Yes, it's pretty muted right now. The second part is on pricing. From a pricing standpoint, as I mentioned before, we've been very disciplined on pricing. And we executed around the pricing initiatives a couple of years and it helped us grow our shares and improve our units. We like where we're priced today. And we don't see the need to go move the needle on pricing as a way to go accelerate sales growth. I'll just remind you that the lion's share of the demand in this business is relatively inelastic. So this industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we continue to see that being the case. And to Phil's point, I mean, we're committed and doubling down on our growth initiatives. It's improving the quality of our parts, it's expanding the assortments with mega hubs, it's improving delivery times, leveraging technologies, being competitive on pricing, all those are the kinds of things that are driving our business as we move forward, and we're pretty excited about the future. We've talked several quarters ago about our aspirations to expand and accelerate our store growth in the back half of the decade. We historically have built about 150 stores, give or take, a few in domestically. And we think that we can significantly expand that number as we move forward. The drivers there, obviously, are the growth opportunities that we see in DIY but also a significant growth opportunity in commercial. And as we look at that, along with the expanded trade areas in the US, there's an opportunity for us to expand our business domestically. And we're going to do that by accelerating our store growth as we move through the balance of the decade. And then internationally, we've been extremely pleased with what we've seen in Mexico, and we like the growth prospects that we've seen in Brazil. And you've seen what we've posted in terms of same store sales comp growth now for several quarters. And there's an opportunity for us to go faster there as well. So that accelerated store growth is certainly a part of our future growth strategy, and it will help us become a faster growing business as we move forward. And then your comment about the capacity of our stores. I mean one of the things that we've done over time is we've continued to optimize the footprint of our satellite stores and then augment that with what we've done with hubs and mega hubs to jam more parts in a local market closer to customers. It's an important part of the growth strategy, both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward, which is one of the reasons why we talked about expanding the number of mega hubs that we have and our mega hub count will be north of 200 at full build-out. And I think part of that, as we think of the commercial market, in general, that's why we've been focused on this notion that we're roughly a five share in what's approaching $100 billion market. Despite the fact that big ticket is pressured across really all of retail and certainly, a big ticket purchase in auto parts is not immune to those dynamics. I mean we still have an opportunity to grow significantly in commercial and an opportunity to grow significantly faster. And so all the things that Phil talked about in terms of our initiatives are the things that we're focused on. And if we do those things and execute on them, then that gives us an opportunity to really accelerate our commercial growth as we move forward. I think you got two dynamics. One, as you mentioned before, is that the comparisons do get a little bit easier in the fourth quarter if you look at our grow-over numbers. But the second one is just the initiatives that Phil talked about. I mean we've been really focused on jamming more parts in the local markets and we've done a great job of doing that, and that's paying dividends for us. And then we've been focused on service and delivery speeds. And if we can win the game in terms of parts availability with jamming those parts in the local market and we can get them to the customer faster, those are things that are going to drive our business as we move forward. So again, we're excited about where we are and excited about the opportunity to accelerate our growth as we move forward. There are always macro challenges that you have to fight your way through and big ticket is pressured. But you combine the fact that we're underpenetrated, we've got a full slate of growth initiatives in place, those are the things that get us excited about the future. So what I'll say is we've run the gross margin play with intensity and our merchandising teams and our supply chain teams have done a fantastic job. You saw last quarter, we had -- this past quarter, we had almost 90 basis points of margin improvement strictly from what we're doing on the merchandising side and what we're doing with the supply chain. I wouldn't suggest that those numbers are going to be as high as we move forward. We are coming out of a period where we had some pretty significant inflation that we got some deflation. And as we mentioned a little bit earlier, we're not getting the ticket necessarily to help us from a gross margin standpoint. So that will be muted some. But we believe that we'll have the potential to offset most, if not all, of the pressure that you see from a LIFO standpoint. The openings will definitely accelerate, and Phil has sort of smiled at me because I own store development as part of my finance responsibilities. And so this is one of my primary objectives for this year. They are big boxes in hard-to-find locations. We've been working through what we need to do from an execution standpoint. I will say it's anybody that's doing new store construction across the business know how challenging the market has been over the last couple of years or so. But we've worked our way through a lot of those challenges this fiscal year. We like the pipeline that we've built and we expect to see that accelerate as we move into FY25."

            "name": "Phil Daniele",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our Web site www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin the call, I want to say thank you to our more than 120,000 AutoZoners across all of our businesses for delivering solid earnings results in the face of a difficult macro environment. With our continued focus on providing what we call WOW! Customer Service, our AutoZoners delivered our total sales increase of 3.5%, total company same store sales up 1.9% and on a constant currency basis, total company same store sales of 0.9%. Also, our operating profit grew 4.9% while our earnings per share grew 7.5%. In spite of our lower than planned sales, we managed our business well and we were able to deliver bottom line results that continued to build on the phenomenal results we've had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere who helped us achieve this quarter's growth. Your dedication to delivering on our commitment of WOW! Customer Service is always inspiring. Before I begin my comments on our third quarter sales, as a reminder, the backdrop to this quarter and every third quarter of our fiscal year includes tax refund season. It is roughly a $300 billion influx of cash to our customers. It begins around Valentine's Day and generally last four to six weeks. These dollars matter to our customers and meaningfully impact their shopping patterns in our stores. This year, refund dollars ended up slightly versus the previous year. However, February refund flows were lower than expected and negatively impacted the first three weeks of the quarter's domestic same store sales. While the refund flows did catch up later in the later weeks, we felt the delayed refunds were a drag on our sales results through February and early March, similar to what you may have heard from other retailers. Secondly, the weather was unfortunately cooler and wetter than we had expected and planned, especially in the Northeast and the Midwest markets. As a result, sales in these markets were noticeably below the remaining markets with this pattern more pronounced over the last eight weeks of our 12 week quarter. Again, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives hard part failures and accelerates maintenance over time, thereby driving higher sales. So on balance, we believe this quarter's sales were impacted negatively by the late start of the tax refund season, while the last eight weeks were impacted by cooler than weather -- than we had planned. Despite these headwinds, we also had many successes. We gained share in our retail business, and we believe we continue to gain share in commercial. We continue to be encouraged by our supply chain initiatives. The construction of our two new domestic DCs are on track for Q2 FY25 opening as well as our continued forward deployment of inventory across both our hubs and our mega hubs. We continue to see progress on our initiatives within our domestic commercial business that give us confidence about accelerated growth. While it is prudent for us to remain cautious on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe sales will accelerate over time. We are excited about our commercial initiatives that are providing deeper parts coverage closer to the customer with faster delivery times, improving customer service and thereby, driving sales. For the third quarter, our total company same store sales were 0.9% on a constant currency basis. As we have mentioned, international has become a more important part of our growth story in this quarter. We delivered another strong quarter, up over 9.3% on a constant currency basis. We continue to be very encouraged with both our short term and long term growth prospects we have internationally and we plan to accelerate new store openings and drive operational improvements in these markets over the next several years. Our domestic same store sales were flat this quarter compared to up 0.3% last quarter and up 1.9% in Q3 of last year. As I mentioned previously, we believe our sales were impacted in the first four weeks of the quarter by the delayed tax refund season and the last eight weeks by the mild wet weather pattern across much of the US. Domestically, we ran a negative 0.7% comp across the first four weeks and collectively across the last eight weeks of plus 0.3% comp. Our commercial business grew 3.3% against last year's Q3 growth of 6.3%. Our commercial results were higher in the first eight weeks and relatively consistent, but slightly lower the last four weeks. The last four weeks comparison were the most difficult of the quarter. Weather impact was more pronounced in the last eight weeks of the quarter and it was during this time that the regional performance disparities became more apparent. The Northeast and the Midwest underperformed the remainder of the country by close to 200 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter. Commercial transaction counts were up and were partially offset by slightly negative ticket growth, which was attributable to similarly negative inflation on a same SKU basis. We opened 20 net new commercial programs and now have commercial in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales for Q3. Despite the choppiness in our commercial sales results this quarter, we are planning for a stronger growth rate in Q4 behind continued execution of our growth initiatives and somewhat easier comparisons. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we've been working on over time, improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality parts and products and technology enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are encouraged by our recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times. As we roll these initiatives to the majority of the chain, we are anticipating faster growth and accelerated share gains. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 1% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of 0.6%. DIY ran negative 2% across the first four weeks of the quarter, positive 0.1% the second four week segment and negative 0.1% comp over the last four weeks. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwestern markets underperformed the remainder of the country by approximately 100 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter similar to our commercial business. Heading into the fourth quarter, we feel weather should be less volatile and we are planning accordingly. Regarding our merchandise categories in the DIY business, our sales floor categories, and particularly discretionary categories, underperformed hard parts. We also saw several seasonal merchandise categories and weather sensitive hard part categories being off our planned results due to the cooler than expected weather. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down approximately 2% while our ticket average was up only 1%. We expect our average ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from the higher inflation from the last couple of years. We attribute our previously mentioned DIY share gains to improve customer service levels in our stores and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels, driven by most of our vendor partners returning to more normalized operations, meaning recovering from the pandemic sales surge and supply chain disruptions. As we look forward, we are continuing to focus on flawless execution and delivering WOW! Customer Service will drive our accelerated sales growth in our domestic business. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 872 stores opened internationally or 12% of our store base, this business had yet again impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our key objectives for fiscal year 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and we believe our improved customer service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We are also focused on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability versus our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on adding capacity to our distribution network. We have two distribution centers that are nearing completion in the US, one in Chao Chilla, California, and the other in New Kent, Virginia. We are also very close to completing the expansion of our Tapeje Mexico DC. And last quarter, we broke ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey, Mexico DC. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed, expanded parts availability and improved efficiencies. These capacity expansions will underpin our future growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this last quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2024, but we must continue to focus on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting customer first are what defines us. We are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital investments where they matter most, our stores, distribution centers, and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority has been enhanced execution. We are making good progress. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on our new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of plus 9.3%, continuing several years of strong growth. While I mentioned all these investments in FY24, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. We continue to believe we have a solid plan in place for growth for the foreseeable future. We know our focus on parts availability and WOW! Customer Service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering the results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. The commercial business, like we said, has been choppy. The last four weeks were the more difficult compares for the quarter. And as we said several times, I hate being the weatherman, but this particular spring has been challenging for us from a wet and cooler season. And typically, in the latter half of the quarter, we start seeing some improved performance around the hot weather categories like AC chemicals and AC hard parts and battery sales, et cetera, and we just didn't get that through the last several weeks of the quarter. On the inflation front, that has definitely been challenging as we've come off several years of hyperinflation, if you will, at our average unit retail on both the DIY side and the commercial side, frankly. I suspect the average unit retail same-SKU inflation would get back to more normal growth levels as we move further and further away from the inflation that we had over the previous years. Now those inflation numbers start to come back as we get in the later quarters of the calendar year, and I suspect they'll return to more normalized levels over time. I would say if you kind of broke apart those segments that you just talked about, probably the most challenged group of customers or customers that are -- drive their repair revenue from tires. Tires have definitely been a pressure point. I think that downward trend on tires has probably flattened out a little bit. But I still think the tire segment, in particular, is under some pressure and has been for quite a while. On your other segment of customers, the buy here, pay here lot and used car centers, those have been more challenged as well. You think about there was tons of used cars that were sold over the last two years or so, and I think that's just been slower. Also, as the consumers under a little bit more economic pressure due to inflation, not just in our category but across all of retail and across life at the moment, I think there's more pressure on some of those bigger ticket items like tires. New tires is a pretty big purchase for a customer. Hubs are up -- I'll just add on. Hubs are -- these have been great stores for us. I think looking over history, we thought we'd have 30 to 40 of these things in various markets. And now we see line of sight to, like Jamere said, well north of 200 mega hubs. And the hubs are still an important part of our strategy as well, which has slightly less SKU count -- well, 30,000 to 40,000 less SKUs than a mega hub, but both of those store bases are great for us. They help significantly on the commercial side of the business and they lift the DIY market as well. So they're great assets for us and performed better than our normal stores. Yes, like you said, we don't give guidance, but here's some things that I'll tell you that I'm excited about. One is weather has been challenging. And we -- I think over summer -- summer is going to heat up, we should get some -- the merchandise categories and mix and things of that nature will help our sales as we move a little bit forward. And although slower than we'd like, our commercial initiatives are working and we think those will continue to mature over time. And in a segment where we're underpenetrated in share, below 5% share on the commercial business, we think we have ample opportunity to continue to grow over time with improved service, improved hard part and expanded part availability and better service and delivery on the -- based on the things we talked about, parts investments, mega hub investments and technology investments that will grow our sales. But it won't be -- it's not going to be a hockey stick that turns around in six weeks or something, it's going to take time. I think there's a couple of things going on with -- if you kind of think about average ticket, some of it, frankly, has been mix of category, and I'll talk about it in a couple of different ways. One is highly discretionary items have been challenged for a while. Some of those have a great ticket. There's probably slightly fewer pieces in the basket. But I think some of that has been driven by the environment and the weather. Big jobs like air conditioning, if you will, those have been definitely muted in the spring time. Those are big jobs that have big tickets, multiple parts in them. When it rains, you're probably going to sell two wiper blades and when it's nice, people decide to do a tune up, you may have all kinds of filters that have significantly more parts transactions -- pieces per transaction in them. So I think ticket average will improve. It's not going to be improved based on hyper inflation like we've had over the last couple of years. But I do believe it will improve as we move through the summertime and get a better mix of product as we move through some of this more challenging weather scenario. Let me start with kind of your first -- the first part of your question. Are there things that we can do to improve? The answer is yes. We're in the process now of doubling down on customer service and execution. And on the commercial side, we're continuing on both sides. We're continuing to invest in hard parts coverage and hubs and mega hubs. Those drive sales. On the commercial side, we continue to invest in ways to service the customer better and faster and we like those initiatives that we have. So I think those help to improve our sales execution, if you will. The second part of the question... Our pricing strategy's on both DIY, we like where we are and we believe we have the right strategies on both sides of the business. We made those investments several years ago to rightsize those strategies. The industry has been very disciplined on pricing over a long period of time, and we don't see that changing. We just wish they'd come faster. Those -- building new stores takes -- it's a long tail from the time you sign a contract to the time we actually open the doors and start selling parts out of them. It just takes longer than we'd like. Yes, that's tough to figure out exactly what's going on in commercial when you you start talking about how is the customer migrating up or down the cost curve, if you will. We don't get near the segmentation on the commercial side that we do on the DIY side and the retail side of the business. But is the customer trading down, I think if you look at some of the segments that we have, that are more challenged, thinking tires, right? Tire purchase could be well north of $1,000 for a customer. Those -- that segment has been challenged for sure. Some of the new car and used car dealer segments have been a little more challenged, partly because I think they're not selling as many units. So those two segments have been challenged. So if you think are customers migrating down because of bigger jobs or down the good, better, best column, I think that's probably true that a customer may -- they may have normally taken a car to an OE dealer, do they then migrate to a Firestone or something of that nature, and do they migrate to the UDS customer or do the job themselves. I think you could see that but it's very hard to understand how customers move on the commercial side of the business. I think we are seeing success. Again, still relatively small in our rollout and that rollout is not very mature at the moment. But we're leveraging some technology, leveraging the technology to handhelds and other technology in our stores to be smarter about how we deliver and where we deliver a part from. We're ultimately able to get the part to the shop faster than we were previously and we're leveraging all of the assets we have in the local market to get those parts to a customer faster, and we like the results that we're seeing. We believe that as we roll these out, our sales will improve in those markets. And ultimately, we'll provide better customer service and gain new customers as well as share of wallet with existing customers. I think big ticket, I think, has been a challenge for the consumer in all of retail, not just us. Like you said, big pieces of our business are break fix, starter, alternator, battery, your car is down, you've got to fix it. And those tickets, while they're large, they're not -- it's not thousands of dollars, it's -- a starter and an alternator could be a couple of hundred bucks. Certainly puts pressure on the low end consumer to have to have that money come out of pocket and they're under pressure. But discretionary categories have been under pressure for, frankly, quite some time. They all exploded during the pandemic when there was a lot of money in the consumer's pocket. And they've certainly been more challenged over the last 18 to 24 months and that continues. But maintenance items, I think as customers get more cash strapped, they look at -- if I take care of my car, I know that it will perform better and save me money in the long run. So maintenance items have a tendency to start to trickle up over time. And then the failure items, if you're going to get the car back on the road, you've got to purchase it. We don't have a lot of good, better, best categories. We have some in brakes and a couple of other categories, but that's not a big piece of our business. The vast majority of our sales are on application parts that have -- you have one choice and the customer buys that part to get their car back on the road. And we think that will continue. It's a great question, I was wondering when the tough weather questions from a winter perspective would come up, and that was kind of that 16%, 17% range you're talking about. It's a great question. It's frankly one we talk about internally all the time. We've had a pretty soft winter weather pattern for the last two years. And when I kind of look across the country, this winter pattern, we got some pretty good weather from a precipitation, snow and temperatures in the Midwest. We got very soft weather patterns relative to driving, break fix part failures on the Eastern seaboard. Wasn't a lot of snow in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., and we didn't have a lot of cold temperatures in those markets. And those typically have meant undercar and brake categories performed very well when you have those types of seasonal patterns. We didn't get that this year and frankly, didn't get it last year. So it's a little undetermined what happens in a long period of time where you haven't had those weather patterns with categories in that half of the country. So I think that is yet to be seen. We don't have the inflation that we had probably back in '17, '18 and frankly, over the last two years to be a benefit. But I do think we'll get a better mix of categories going into the summer selling season than we've had in Q3. So I don't know if I'm really answering your question. I think that's yet to be seen and I think it will prove out over the next four months or so. We've been working on this for probably a year, year and half, and we started seeing the results that we really liked earlier this year and started ramping it up. We're probably in the middle innings, if you will, of rolling that out to our stores, we've got -- in our networks. We've got some more to go and we'll continue to add incremental stores as we move through the process. But I would say we're in middle innings. We do believe that as we roll this out, again, we believe we get better customer service, faster time to shop. And we believe with that better customer service, we'll gain new customers and grow share of wallet. It won't be an immediate snap but we like the efforts and the growth that we're seeing in those markets. And I think the good thing is we know exactly where we want these stores in every metro market or adding multiples to a given city or an individual market that may have a smaller number of stores. We know where we want to be. We want to make sure we get them at the right distance from our current locations. And they've got to have good routes so they're easily accessible to the other markets. And then you got to find the spot that is a great retail location and a great place to do to fulfill and get these expanded parts to our shops and our stores fast. And it's just -- it takes time. We'd love to go faster because they're great boxes for us and they know -- they help us on both DIY and commercial. Great, thank you. Okay. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year but will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics, and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, I ask that we all remember our country's heroes both past and present. We owe these great Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you again for participating in today's call."

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them. As we begin this morning, I'd like to say how honored I am to talk with you on behalf of our more than 120,000 AutoZoners. As today marks my first conference call as AutoZone\u2019s, President and Chief Executive Officer. At AutoZone, our first priority is to provide what we call WOW! Customer Service. This quarter, the efforts of our AutoZoners increased our total sales by 4.6% and total company same-store sales by 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Both our operating profit and earnings per share grew by a very impressive double-digit rates We continue to build on the phenomenal performance we had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere, who helped us achieve this amazing growth. Before I begin my comments regarding our second quarter sales, as a reminder, this is always our most volatile quarter to predict as the timing and severity of winter weather is both meaningful and variable. It is also our lowest sales volume quarter. This year, the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays fell on a Monday compared to Sunday last year. For commercial sales, this really mattered. Sunday is a very low sales day while Monday is one of the best. While weather across the US was very mild for the first 8 weeks of the quarter, we experienced a polar vortex and snow in the last four weeks. This extreme weather helped to propel us to stronger results in DIY, but muted our sales in commercial as snow in much of the Eastern United States, stayed on the ground for an extended period of time. Again, weather extremes either hot or cold, drive hard part failures and accelerate maintenance over time. For the second quarter, our total company same-store sales were 1.5% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story in an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, we will continue reporting on our international performance. We encourage you to focus on the same-store sales, constant currency number where International, again, had a strong quarter, up 10.6%. We are very excited about the short and long-term growth prospects internationally, and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years. Our domestic same-store sales were up 0.3% this quarter compared to 1.2% last quarter and 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Breaking our 12 weeks of sales into the first eight weeks and then the last four weeks, you can see the impact of the holiday shift and the weather volatility. Domestically, we ran a negative 1.8% comp across the first eight weeks and a positive 4.4% comp in the last four weeks. This was even more pronounced when splitting these time frames up between commercial and DIY. Our commercial business grew 2.7% against very strong sales last year of 13.1%. Although our commercial business finished stronger than we started, our results were below our expectations. Across the 12-week quarter, we were up 4.1% for the first four weeks, then down 0.7% over the second four-week segment and up 4.4% over the last four weeks. Although better in the last four weeks segment, of the quarter, our sales were depressed due to the winter storms shutting down many commercial customers, particularly in the mid-south. The holiday shift combined with weather negatively impacted our sales by roughly 2% for the quarter. Despite all this volatility in commercial sales, we are encouraged that we finished the quarter stronger. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on over time. Improved satellite and store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technology enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times in commercial, while very early, we are encouraged by the initial results. In commercial, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. In Q2, we opened 20 net new commercial programs. We now have commercial programs in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales for Q2. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rates will improve as we move through the year. Sales growth comparisons get easier in the back half of the year and our execution, customer delivery times, in-stock levels, and parts availability continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 0.3% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of positive 2.7%. DIY ran 0.7% across the first four weeks of the quarter, a negative 6.2% across the second four-week segment and a positive 4.8% comp over the last four weeks. The last four-week time segment was accelerated due to the winter weather, as a reminder, last year, the polar vortex hit in the second four-week segment. I'd like to add some color on our regional performance as well. The Northeast and the Midwest markets underperformed the remainder of the country by 500 basis points in the middle four-week segment, only to swing to a positive 1,250 basis points overperformance for the last four-week segment. For the quarter, we saw a 270 basis point favorable performance in the Northeast and the Midwest versus the remainder of the country. Although the Midwest had some extreme cold, we frankly would like to see more winter weather along the East Coast markets, where the winter has been persistently mild for more than two years now. Overall, for the quarter, the West performed least favorably. Headed into the third quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern, meaning we feel weather will not play a big story, one way or the other. Our Q3 performance is always contingent on a normalized tax refund season and we expect this year to be similar to last year. Regarding our merchandise categories and DIY business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback, particularly from the low-end consumer. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down 2.2%, while our ticket average was up 1.7%. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from higher inflation last year. We attribute our share gains to improve customer service levels in our store, and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels driven by improved productivity in our distribution centers. While we are up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress. We've made many changes across the organization. From doubling down on many of our long-term execution processes, ensuring that we are hiring the best AutoZoners and reducing turnover, our execution is improving, and we're making steady progress. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 859 stores opened internationally or 12% of our total store base, the business had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And finally, before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our overarching objectives for fiscal 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and believe our improved service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We also continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight and drive improved availability. First is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we're making good progress on transforming our distribution network. We have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction in the US, Chowchilla, California and New Kent, Virginia. We are also nearing the completion of our expanded Tepeji, Mexico distribution center. Additionally, we have broken ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey distribution center. Our strategy is focusing on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed and expanded parts availability and improved efficiency. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. \nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid second quarter, marking our fifth sequential quarter of double-digit EPS growth. This quarter, we delivered 4.6% total company sales growth with a 0.3% domestic comp, a 10.6% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.9% increase in EBIT and a 17.2% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were up -- were $3.9 billion, up 4.6% and let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 2.7% to $980 million and were up 15.8% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $14,051, down 2.8% versus last year. Once again, the weekly sales averages were impacted by the addition of a significant number of immature programs over the last couple of quarters. I'll also remind you that Q1 and Q2 are our toughest comparisons this fiscal year and we expect our year-over-year comparisons to be somewhat easier in the back half of our fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 20 net new programs finishing with 5,823 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we seek to grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 101 Mega Hub locations. Our Mega Hubs continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs and grew more than three times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q2. Our Mega Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open Mega Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 Mega Hubs at full buildout. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was negative 0.3% for the quarter, as Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2.2%, offset by 1.7% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q2, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. In addition, miles driven are back to pre-pandemic levels. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the remainder of FY 2024. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally, our same-store sales grew an impressive 23.9% on an actual basis and 10.6% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened six stores in Mexico to finish with 751 stores and four stores in Brazil, ending with 108. We remain committed to international and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.9%, up 160 basis points, driven primarily by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 63 basis points from a non-cash $10 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $14 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 97 basis points improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter's 70 basis point improvement. We've had exceptional gross margin improvement. And in fact, Q2's gross margin was at the highest gross margin rate we've had since Q2 of FY 2021. I'll point out that we now have $43 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $15 million of LIFO credits for Q3 based on the deflation experienced in Q1 and Q2. This compares to the $17 million LIFO credit we had in Q3 last year, which means we'll have a $2 million net LIFO headwind in gross profit in Q3. As I've said previously, once we credit back to $43 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6.1% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 49 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends and customer experience, speed, and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $743 million, up 10.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $102.6 million, up 56% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $7 billion at Q2 end last year. We're planning interest in the $105 million range for the third quarter of FY 2024 versus $74.3 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.6% and down from last year's second quarter of 21.2%, this quarter's rate benefited 360 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 222 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2024, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $515 million, up 8.1% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.8 million was 7.8% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $28.89, up 17.2% for the quarter. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $179 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I'll also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of our fiscal year. We expect to continue to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.4 times EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 1.6% versus last year, while total inventory increased 4.2% driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $164,000 versus negative $227,000 last year and negative $197,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percentage of inventory finished the quarter at 119.8% versus last year's 127.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $224 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just over $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We've bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target in the 2.5 times area and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY 2024, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated and should accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you, Jamere. I want to stress how proud I am to represent the company as only the fifth CEO over the almost 45 years we have been in business. As you've heard, we have a lot of initiatives in flight and we have a great team of AutoZoners in place to take us to the next level. We truly believe we will continue to improve from here. We are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margin margins are solid, and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital expenditures where it matters most. Our stores, our distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in various stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on the new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.6%, much higher than our domestic comps. International has been strong for several years now. While I mentioned all these investments in FY 2024, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. While Q2 was below our expectations, we believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the remainder of the year. We know our focus on parts availability and wow customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducing a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nPhil Daniele: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Horvers: Good morning. Thanks for all the information. My first question for you is, on the domestic Pro business, what's your sense of what the market is actually growing, especially in light of your mix? Obviously, your largest and most relevant competitor has a much smaller mix of national accounts. So I don't think that's obvious to us from the outside. So how are you seeing the performance of national accounts? Are you seeing that start to get better? Do we have to wait to lap that starting in June and July? And how do you think that you're growing relative to the market on the Pro side?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. So if you kind of segmented the business, I think an area of customer growth on the commercial side that's been more challenged has been the folks that are more focused on under car. So think brakes, suspension, those types of areas related to the tire, one of the four corners of the car, those have probably been the areas that have been more challenged. So for us, that's categories like brakes and suspension, which we talked quite extensively about that over the last year. And that's probably been where we've been most challenged, but I'll go back to the growth opportunities we have in the commercial. At the end of the day, we still have pretty low share and there's a big opportunity for us to continue to grow share in both terms of share of wallet for the customer as well as new customers.\nChris Horvers: So does that mean that -- I mean, I guess, if you were going to isolate more of the up and down the street account? Or are you seeing better relative performance? And I know you're reluctant to give too much detail in breaking out more detail, but like any commentary of like what the performance gap between like a national account business versus and up and down the street account would be really helpful. Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: I would say the national accounts, depending on who they are, they can be wildly positive or negative depending on as you pick up business or your mature business, et cetera. I probably should have mentioned another area that's been challenged for us really for the last 18 months has been the Buy here, Pay here segment in the used car segment. Those have been pretty challenged as well, as they've struggled with inventory. They had incredible sales coming out of the pandemic, and that's probably been a pretty challenged segment as well.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then on the -- you mentioned tax refund is expected to be normal this year. I mean, based on the data that we track, it does seem to be lagging year-over-year. So can you talk about what you mean in terms of the expectation on tax refunds, it would seem like it actually plays out a little more inverted where you get benefit later this quarter versus some headwinds at the start of the quarter? Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: We're effectively two weeks into our quarter, a couple of weeks into our quarter. And the taxes may be pushed back a week or two. But I think over the 12-week quarter, we expect them to be pretty similar to last year and it's -- the vast majority of the taxes should land well within our 12-week time frame. So maybe slightly moved back a little bit, but not meaningful to the quarter. We expect it to be normal.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nPhil Daniele: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: I guess a question on the competitive landscape as it relates to WDs, they seem to get better after maybe 2022 into 2023 could you talk about the up and down The Street business? Is that a pretty stable competitive environment? Do they still improve? Or are they sort of plateauing?\nPhil Daniele: Well, on the -- sorry, just to make sure I'm clear on your question. Questions relative to the WDs or to the actual--\nBret Jordan: Yes, WD competitors. It seemed like they were raising their game for a bit after the pandemic and whether they're kind of stable where they are. Are they still -- are they becoming more competitive still?\nPhil Daniele: Yes, I think it's hard to tell exactly what's going on in their business. But from my sense -- and we see it in our business as well. The vast majority of the supply chain constraints that you had in the latter half of the pandemic have resolved themselves, for the most part, we'll still continue to improve. In stocks are not quite back to where they were previous to the pandemic. I suspect they will continue to improve slightly. And I would also think that the vast majority of the WDs that had the inventory issues in the latter half of the pandemic have probably recovered for the most part. So, I think they're better, but I don't think they're going to have -- they're not going to materially get better over the next short period of time. I would say everybody is pretty much back to slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nBret Jordan: Great. And then I guess a question on international. O'Reilly has gone and acquired batt, and it seems like there's some Carquest assets for sale out there. Is Canada a market that you think about is -- or are really focused in Mexico and sort of secondarily Brazil?\nPhil Daniele: Yes, I would say we have -- I mean, we've got two markets that we're trying to expand in today, which are obviously Mexico and Brazil. And we like where we are in our international footprint. Canada is interesting. I would say -- I would never say we would not look at Canada, but it does have a pretty solid competitive base up there. And we just think there's better opportunities for us at the moment in the current markets that we have. We've got plenty of expansion opportunities in both markets, and we like our performance internationally. It doesn't mean we never go to Canada, but it's not a focus for us at the moment.\nBret Jordan: Not in 2024?\nPhil Daniele: No. You got six months left in 2024. In our 2024 anyway.\nBret Jordan: Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: Thanks Bret.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks Bret.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. You still see an opportunity to return the commercial business back to a double-digit growth rate over time? Why or why not?\nPhil Daniele: Hey Michael, great question, and thanks for the question. At the end of the day, we have -- let me go back to our comment on share. We have very low share in this marketplace. I think we will improve from here. Can I tell you exactly when we're going to get back to double-digit growth? No. I would expect that we would grow faster. We have initiatives in place that we'll think we will accelerate our sales growth, particularly in the back half of this year, and it will continue. To nail the date when I think we get back to a positive double-digit number is frankly tough to do. There's a lot of variables in there. I think we'll see consistent share growth and consistent same-store sales and total growth in the commercial market for a long time to come, probably because we have -- we're better than we were as we continue to expand our hubs and mega hubs, improve our assortments and take share, we see a long-term growth trajectory for the commercial side of the business.\nMichael Lasser: Got you. That's helpful, Phil. Thank you so much. My follow-up question is that AutoZone's gross margin has really been growing nicely for some time now. But at what point does the gross margin get too high such that they invite more competition within the sector, especially on the commercial side?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah, I don't think we're over-earning from a gross margin standpoint. We've been very disciplined about gross margin expansion. We've been very disciplined about pricing. And what we're actually seeing in our gross margins today is we come out of the period where we had very high freight costs. We had a supply base that was very challenged from a cost standpoint when you looked at what was happening with transportation costs, wages and just overall inflation in general. As we've moved past those periods, it gives us an opportunity now to start to negotiate deflation with our supply base. And at the same time, as we took pricing during those higher inflationary periods, we're not giving back retails. So what you're actually seeing is a natural evolution of gross margins, if you will. The other thing I'll remind you is that our supply chain was particularly challenged during this time frame. And as our supply chain has improved its cost performance and its efficiencies, we're seeing some gross margin improvement in the from our supply chain. So this industry has been very, very disciplined for decades. We'll continue to be disciplined for decades. We don't believe that we're over earning and it's been a very disciplined approach to gross margin expansion and growing market share over time.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you so much, Phil, Jamere and Brian, and good luck.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. Jamere, can I follow up on something you just said. So you're trying to negotiate deflation. So the idea to drive down procurement costs, but fully hold retails?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I mean, if you look at what's happened in this industry literally for decades is during periods where we have high inflation or even hyperinflation, we've raised retails to basically cover those additions and cost. And then as those cost pressures abate, this industry typically does not lower retails. So what you're seeing is the natural progression that we've seen from a gross margin standpoint as we're now in a period where things are becoming a little bit more deflationary, it gives us an opportunity to expand our margins, if you will. And we've been very disciplined about doing that as has the entire industry over this time period.\nPhilip Daniele: Let me -- can I add just another comment on that. I think if you go back and look at some of the gross margin pressures we had in the -- specifically in the latter half of the pandemic where the supply chain was most stressed. Some of those costs that we had in logistics, either overseas or internal in the US, not all of those costs got pushed on to the consumer, because we didn't want to kill unit demand. So we've hurdled some of that. To Jamere's point, we took those prices up and as the underlying logistics cost basis comes down, that margin is what you're seeing today. We don't think we'll give the pricing back because this industry has been very price rational over to Jamere's point, decades. We just don't see that retail pricing having to come back down.\nScot Ciccarelli: So just to clarify. So unless we see a spike in logistics or freight costs, the assumption should be where your current run rate of gross margin is, should be kind of the forward number we should be thinking of?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. And the only thing that I would add to that is that we do expect our commercial business to grow faster as we move forward. And so that naturally will put some drag on the gross margin percentage, if you will, we'll take that trade-off because it will give us an opportunity to have more gross margin dollars. So there'll likely be a mix pressure as we move forward with a faster growing commercial business. But the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing in gross margin in terms of deflation, in terms of improving supply chain profile is something that is sustainable as we move forward.\nScot Ciccarelli: Super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Phil, I know it's tricky to prescribe when the commercial comps get back to double-digit. Can you give us a sense, I don't know if innings is the right way to think about it, where your efforts are in totality you mentioned faster delivery times, labor normalizing. There's some supply chain investments. So the collective of those, where you are on that journey to where you want to get to? \nPhil Daniele: Yes. The part of your question there is what are we doing that have helped stabilize our business and get it back on a more stable footing. Our in-stocks have come back to very close to pre-pandemic levels. We've expanded our hubs and our Mega Hubs. We have a long way to go to get to our ultimate goals of North of 200 Mega Hubs. And significantly more hubs as well. Those put hard-to-find parts in the market where we can get those parts to our commercial customers, in particular, faster. It also helps DIY. It will take us quite a few innings, if you will, to get to more than 200 of those hubs. They just take longer to set up and get in place. But that is improving our efforts on delivery times. We've put in -- we've invested in technology. We've been talking about this for quite some time. We continue to leverage the technology we put in the hands of our commercial AutoZoners, and we've got some tests in place in some early innings where we're able to show better delivery times by enabling better technology and leveraging that technology. So that will take time to roll out and it will take time for our AutoZoners to digest the change management. So in the quarter of -- in the number of innings, if we're going to play baseball, which starts pretty soon this year, we'll -- maybe we're in the third or the fourth inning. But hopefully, we'll have a rally in the ninth inning.\nSimeon Gutman: Good. I wanted to ask you, I think we asked Jamere when he joined, but since you've taken over, I wanted to ask about the EBIT dollar growth question versus margin. And part of it is timely because one of your competitors has been leading into SG&A, and it seems to be working and you're having a bifurcation in performance now in the sector. So your thought process on that balance and then leaning into SG&A over a longer period of time to take advantage of some displacement.\nPhil Daniele: Yes. On the SG&A front, I would we have investments that are some in CapEx, some obviously in SG&A. To the degree we can invest and grow sales and EBIT dollars, we'll make those investments all day every day. I think over time, you should see us get our EBIT -- our SG&A growth should start to bend down slightly. I wouldn't expect a radical change, but we've had a lot of investments as we continue to improve our operational efficiencies in our distribution centers, in our stores, as our AutoZoners get longer tenured and we hold on and reduce turnover things of that nature, they will obviously start bringing down some of the SG&A on the margins. But we would invest in a kind of -- I think maybe part of your question is, would we take lower margin rates in commercial as a mix of sales like Jamere mentioned to get higher gross profit dollars? Absolutely. I think we can slightly expand our margins on both DIY and commercial over time? Yes. And in an effort to increase EBIT dollars, we'll do that all day long. Those are good exchanges for us.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good luck.\nPhil Daniele: Thanks Simeon.\nOperator: Your next question for today is from Seth Sigman with Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: Hey good morning everyone. I wanted to follow up on a couple of those points around the commercial. A lot of noise this quarter, if you step back, there was a lot of momentum in this business pre-2020 and then you clearly outperformed very significantly for multiple years, right? And then the business has slowed, reverting back to maybe more like industry growth, I'm not sure. But I guess the real question is what gives you confidence that this is the right go-forward strategy, particularly from a supply chain perspective? As you think about the next leg of growth, mega hubs has been the central part of that strategy. Is that right? Are there other options that you've thought about? I'd love to get some perspective on that. Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: Yes. We're extremely excited about both of our -- both our hub and our mega hub strategy. And I'll use the previous comments around innings. We think we'll have well north of 200 mega hub and significantly larger growth of hubs. We're roughly in the third inning or so in hub growth -- mega hub growth. If you kind of said that, that strategy works for us. We see significantly higher growth in those stores -- those types of stores, and they help feed harder to find inventory to what we call our satellite stores, the markets that are close to those hubs. So, yes, we believe that is the right strategy. We will continue to modify and enhance our assortment strategies in both our satellite stores and our mega hubs and hubs to get more relevant inventory closer to the customer. The faster we can get those hard-to-find parts into the shop, the better we will grow market share. And by the way, all of that inventory we add for the commercial customer also finds its way to sales on the DIY customer.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Thank you for that. I guess just thinking about the programs that you've added over the last year or so. You've talked about the drag from some of these newer programs. Just any perspective on how the new programs are ramping and if that's any different than what you've seen in the past? Thanks.\nJamere Jackson: Yes, I mean the math on that is we've added over the last couple of years or so, almost 600 new programs. So, we went back and retrofitted several stores that didn't have commercial programs. If you remember, historically, we ran sort of 80% to 85% of our stores have a commercial program. That number is now up over 92%. We really accelerated that over the last several quarters. So right now, we've got probably 300 to 400 immature commercial programs that are ramping up in terms of sales and efficiency and performance. And as those programs mature, it will certainly provide a tailwind to our business. So when Phil talks about this notion of our commercial business improving from an execution standpoint, we not only have that working in our favor, but we also have these maturing programs that have only been in operation for the last couple of quarters. And so if we think about the commercial business very broadly, I just keep grounding us back to this notion that we're underpenetrated. We have a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. We've put a number of things in place that are delivering and have delivered exceedingly well for us. And as we move forward, we like the competitive hand that we have with growing mega hub footprints, improving execution and adding more commercial programs it\u2019s our number one growth priority inside the company and we\u2019re all hands on deck there. And the last thing, I\u2019ll just say is as you think about commercial as you think about the back half of this year, the front half of this year, we had \u2013 we\u2019re up against 15 comp and then a 13 comp, the back half of the year, the comps get a little bit easier. So the comments that we made earlier in our prepared comments are just along the notion that the comparisons get a little bit easier. And as we have all of these things from an initiative standpoint, working in our favor, it gives us a lot of confidence about our back half execution.\nPhil Daniele: In fact, let me add a little bit on to that, too, specifically around new stores, and I'll maybe take a little bit of a history lesson here. If you go back to FY 2017 or those types of number of years, our productivity per store, we have been on a pretty heavy diet of opening up new programs. And then we decided, from a strategy perspective, we would slow down our new store openings for commercial and really start trying to drive per store productivity. Back then, our per store productivity was in the $7,000 to $8,000 range. Today, as Jamere quoted earlier in the prepared comments, we're significantly higher than that. The other thing that's happened is as we open up new programs in today's environment versus years ago, they are maturing at a faster rate and get to a higher, more plateaued rate. So we like that math. We're probably not going to open up 60 or 600 stores in the next two years or so like we have over the recent history. That will probably slow a little bit. But we like the way the new stores come out of the box and the maturity curves that we get versus, frankly, 2017 or 2018.\nSeth Sigman: Thank you both. Appreciate it.\nPhil Daniele: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on Seth's question. And just a way to maybe contextualize the mega hub strategy for us. Is there any way to think through or maybe discuss the contribution to growth, or how ROI is trending behind these investments versus what the potential should be as we look out a couple of few years? Like any numeric contextualization of where we are in the maturity curve of the initiatives?\nJamere Jackson: Yeah. I think a couple of things stand out to us. The first is that the mega hubs are growing from a commercial perspective and from an overall perspective, significantly faster than our satellite stores. And it's over 3x what we see on a total domestic business basis. So we've been very pleased with the tremendous sales lift that we're getting inside of the box, both on the DIY and the commercial side. I think the second thing that gives us a lot of confidence is we talked about this notion of testing multiple mega hubs in major metro markets. And we've done that over the last few years or so. And the idea there was to jam more Mega Hubs in a market and jam more parts closer to the customer to see really how high is high. And what we experienced in that time frame was the fact that we didn't see the kind of cannibalization that we would have anticipated, which suggested that the number of Mega Hubs that we could actually operate was significantly higher. And if you'll recall, we had Mega Hub targets that went from 100 to North of 200 over a very short period of time. So we like what we see from a sales standpoint. We like what we see from an earnings standpoint. And we -- and it's not only what we're seeing inside the four walls, but it's also the fact that these Mega Hubs are an important fulfillment source for the surrounding satellite stores. So when you put all that together in the mix, I mean, it's a pretty attractive story for us both in terms of sales and earnings and return on investments. And we're going to go as fast as we possibly can to accelerate.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you for that. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the outlook for expense growth. I think you mentioned how it should \u2013 should curve downward. But obviously, we also have the store growth acceleration plan, looking at the 2026 and beyond. And so maybe just help provide additional clarity on why there's sort of no disconnect in maybe sort of leaning into the investment cycle ahead of a ramp in store growth? I mean is there any risk that EBIT margin could or should take a step back as you sort of ramp the business for a more accelerated growth period?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I mean we've invested in SG&A in a very disciplined fashion over the last several years or so. And what we've always said is that over time, SG&A growth should be in line with what we see in terms of the top line. Now in the near-term, to your point, we've invested at an accelerated pace behind technology, behind store payroll, all of those things to drive near-term growth for us. And we won't hesitate to go do that. To the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in SG&A to drive our growth initiatives, we will do that as we've done historically. As we move out and look to accelerate our store growth, there will be some drag on SG&A, but we should be able to manage that within that framework that I talked about.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Hi, Thanks. Congrats as a nice quarter. I would just like to follow-up on inflation. So if ticket was up 1.7%, is it fair to say that same SKU inflation was sort of near that number and that -- how did items of basket and mix, et cetera, out in the quarter?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So what we've seen on ticket growth was something in the low single-digits right now. And we're seeing same SKU inflation somewhere in that same ZIP code, Greg. I think the important thing to recognize from an inflation standpoint is we came off a period of significantly higher inflation. That's tempered some. Most of that inflation was driven by freight. So, as freight costs have come down, we've seen some of that inflation start to come down as well. And I think the overarching point is that we're continuing to be very disciplined about pricing, where there are opportunity for us to take retail as we will do so and where there's an opportunity for us to get deflation in our cost to drive gross margin, we'll do that as well. We're not expecting sort of the same levels of inflation to drive ticket growth that we have in the last year or so. And so you should expect ticket at some point to normalize back in that low to mid-single-digit range to offset the decline that we naturally see on the DIY side from transactions.\nGreg Melich: Got it. But presumably, that -- a little bit of acceleration in ticket comes from mix and items of basket rather than inflation ticking up, same SKU?\nJamere Jackson: I think that's right. And as we move forward, I mean, it's a pretty dynamic environment out there even from an inflation standpoint. We'll stay very close to and be disciplined about how we manage our business.\nPhil Daniele: Go back over long periods of time, decades, I mean, this industry has had a slight decline in transactions and units and an increase in ticket average and average unit retails in that somewhere between 2% to 4% range on average, predominantly because of changes in technology, better parts, and some -- it's great to think about belts on a car. Used to -- the average car used to have belts on it today, they have one. And the belt used to be $4 or $5 today about maybe $60 or $70. So that technology change is probably going to continue. And that's been -- it's been a pretty understandable decline in units and a change in average unit retail and we generally have pretty good line of sight to this because the product development takes years and an item may stay in our stores for 20 years. It's the beauty of having a -- frankly, a lower term business that's very predictable.\nGreg Melich: I'd love to follow up on SG&A and investment there. Jamere, maybe could you level set us on just what wage inflation is running now and what you're looking at for the next few quarters? And if you think about these pilots that you're doing on the faster delivery, it sounds like it's a lot of tech investment. But is there -- are there delivery people as well? Just help us understand that a little bit more, the reacceleration of commercial there?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So, from an average wage standpoint, we're thrilled that we're starting to see average wages now with a two handle versus a three or four that we've seen over the last few years or so. So, as things have cooled down, we've seen some of the hyperinflation go away in the labor markets. We're now back to more normalized sort of wage inflation, if you will. Now, in terms of the investments that we're making, nearly every investment that we have from a growth initiative standpoint is underpinned by some changes in technology. Whether that's on the commercial side with what we're looking to do with some of our commercial acceleration initiatives are on the retail side, nearly all of those growth initiatives are underpinned by some changes that we're making in technology. Our technology teams have done a tremendous job doing that in a very cost-efficient way. And we -- and as we move forward, we'll continue to invest in a very disciplined way as we move forward. In terms of the commercial business and how we improve delivery. I mean we've been very efficient in terms of how we've deployed our physical assets in terms of vehicles and our people assets in terms of labor to manage that commercial business over time, and there hasn't been a meaningful change in what we're doing there.\nGreg Melich: Great. Thanks and good luck.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen.\nMax Rakhlenko: Great. Thanks a lot guys. So in the stores where you're piloting the initiatives to improve DIFM services and speed levels, just how is that going versus your own internal expectations? And then how are you thinking about scaling these initiatives over the coming quarters? Just curious how early those are and when you think that they could be ready to go lighter?\nPhil Daniele: Yeah. It's -- thank you for the question. And it's early innings in that. We've been testing some stuff, how to use the data we've had our -- if you think about our handhelds and a lot of technology enhancements that we made over the last couple of years, and now we've got a pretty robust set of data where we can look and figure out what are the best and most efficient ways to use our assets, both human assets, our great AutoZoners and our trucks and where the inventory is, how do we get the part to the customer the fastest to improve customer service? It is early innings, but we like what we see, and we're in the process of rolling that out. There's some change management that we have to work through. There's some changes in technology that our AutoZoners need to be comfortable with and some changes in operations in the stores. But we like what we see, and we've had some pauses and evaluate and then move a little further, pause and evaluate and move a little further, but we're happy with what we see, and we think it will improve customer service to the shop, and we'll get the parts faster to the customer without having to drive the car any faster because we want to be safe.\nMax Rakhlenko: Got it. It's very helpful. And then can you just speak to your in-store staff retention rates? How are those trending, and if that's translating into improvements in pro satisfaction? And then ultimately, better demand trends in those stores. \nPhil Daniele: I'll say two things have happened. One is -- and we've mentioned it a couple of different times. We've if you think about staffing in whole, it's not back to pre-pandemic levels, but it's better than it was during the pandemic. We still have work to do to get retention and turnover back down to pre-pandemic levels, both in our stores and in our distribution centers, but improving, and we like the trends that we're seeing, although we'd love it to be faster. The other thing we did on commercial, and Jamere has mentioned it a couple of times, we've opened up roughly 600 stores in slightly over two years. As we did that, obviously, that takes your -- the commercial specialists and the TSMs and things of that nature, those really high caliber of people that were concentrated in some stores, we expanded pretty quickly. So you got new promotions and people got to learn their job and learn those new shops and get really ingrained with those long-term relationships, and that will continue to get better as we move forward. So it's kind of two elements.\nMax Rakhlenko: Great. Thanks. Best regards.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you. Appreciate the question. I think we have time for one last call.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Thanks for slipping me in.\nPhil Daniele: Hi, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: So with my first question, I know there's been a lot of questions on commercial, and we recognize this has been an ongoing conversation. There's a lot of moving parts here as we look at the kind of the near-term trends. But I guess not at the risk of being too simplistic. We for a long time have talked about a key measure of success in commercial, so to say, climbing that list. In each individual store climbing that list of the \u2013 your mechanic customer. So the question I have is, as you pull and talk to your stores, are you seeing any indications that you're falling further down those lists or maybe the climb up some of these lists stalled?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. I mean, to say we're falling down the list. I don't think that would be a good characterization. Is there always opportunities to improve? The answer is yes. Go back to our share comments that we've made several times we still have under 5% share, we believe. And as we get better and mature in relationships, open up new stores, get better in new stores and drive parts availability and what we call internally time to shop. The quicker we can get those parts to the shop, the better we'll be. And this -- I think there's a bit of a misnomer that a customer has a first call. They all -- nobody has every part that's needed in a particular shop. So a customer will have multiple people they call. we think we will continually move up the call list and gain a larger share of wallet for each customer, but to say that you're always first call with any particular customers, that's pretty rare for a customer to put all of their eggs in one basket because nobody's got all the parts. It's virtually impossible. There's too many SKUs. So I think we will continue to get better. I think we've gotten better from where we were, and we've got a long road in front of us to continue to take market share and gain new customers.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up just on weather. And in your prepared comments, you talked about some of the sales volatility we saw through the fiscal Q2. and obviously, weather was a key component of that. But I guess the question I have is as you look at the weather, maybe we're not even through winter yet, but as you look at the weather, has it been enough -- has there been enough winter weather, so to say, give you that normal driver business as we head into spring and even in the summer? \nPhil Daniele: Yes. Great question, and time will tell. We're not completely through winter weather, as you said. I think if I could lay out the weather calendar that I'd love to have, like I said, I would love to have more really cold winter in the big cities on the eastern seaboard. I mean if you're in New York, you've got a little bit of snow this year and it was gone within 24 hours. It's a heck of a lot more than you got last year. But New York, Philadelphia, D.C., those areas really haven't had a lot of really extreme cold weather. The Midwest did and the eastern half of the Northeast or the western half. I'm sorry, I got some pretty cold weather. But the big metro cities along the East Coast just really haven't for more than two years now. So I would love to have had more there, but that's something that we can't control. We're going to do our best to go grow market share in those company -- in those areas of the country, no matter what. So thanks for the follow-up question.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks, guys. Thank you.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you. All right. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment and reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position, and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers do have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed in the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and drive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident, AutoZone will be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Let me -- can I add just another comment on that. I think if you go back and look at some of the gross margin pressures we had in the -- specifically in the latter half of the pandemic where the supply chain was most stressed. Some of those costs that we had in logistics, either overseas or internal in the US, not all of those costs got pushed on to the consumer, because we didn't want to kill unit demand. So we've hurdled some of that. To Jamere's point, we took those prices up and as the underlying logistics cost basis comes down, that margin is what you're seeing today. We don't think we'll give the pricing back because this industry has been very price rational over to Jamere's point, decades. We just don't see that retail pricing having to come back down."

            "name": "Jamere Jackson",
            "content": "Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid second quarter, marking our fifth sequential quarter of double-digit EPS growth. This quarter, we delivered 4.6% total company sales growth with a 0.3% domestic comp, a 10.6% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.9% increase in EBIT and a 17.2% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were up -- were $3.9 billion, up 4.6% and let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 2.7% to $980 million and were up 15.8% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $14,051, down 2.8% versus last year. Once again, the weekly sales averages were impacted by the addition of a significant number of immature programs over the last couple of quarters. I'll also remind you that Q1 and Q2 are our toughest comparisons this fiscal year and we expect our year-over-year comparisons to be somewhat easier in the back half of our fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 20 net new programs finishing with 5,823 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we seek to grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 101 Mega Hub locations. Our Mega Hubs continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs and grew more than three times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q2. Our Mega Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open Mega Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 Mega Hubs at full buildout. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was negative 0.3% for the quarter, as Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2.2%, offset by 1.7% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q2, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. In addition, miles driven are back to pre-pandemic levels. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the remainder of FY 2024. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally, our same-store sales grew an impressive 23.9% on an actual basis and 10.6% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened six stores in Mexico to finish with 751 stores and four stores in Brazil, ending with 108. We remain committed to international and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.9%, up 160 basis points, driven primarily by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 63 basis points from a non-cash $10 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $14 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 97 basis points improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter's 70 basis point improvement. We've had exceptional gross margin improvement. And in fact, Q2's gross margin was at the highest gross margin rate we've had since Q2 of FY 2021. I'll point out that we now have $43 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $15 million of LIFO credits for Q3 based on the deflation experienced in Q1 and Q2. This compares to the $17 million LIFO credit we had in Q3 last year, which means we'll have a $2 million net LIFO headwind in gross profit in Q3. As I've said previously, once we credit back to $43 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6.1% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 49 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends and customer experience, speed, and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $743 million, up 10.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $102.6 million, up 56% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $7 billion at Q2 end last year. We're planning interest in the $105 million range for the third quarter of FY 2024 versus $74.3 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.6% and down from last year's second quarter of 21.2%, this quarter's rate benefited 360 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 222 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2024, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $515 million, up 8.1% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.8 million was 7.8% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $28.89, up 17.2% for the quarter. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $179 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I'll also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of our fiscal year. We expect to continue to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.4 times EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 1.6% versus last year, while total inventory increased 4.2% driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $164,000 versus negative $227,000 last year and negative $197,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percentage of inventory finished the quarter at 119.8% versus last year's 127.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $224 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just over $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We've bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target in the 2.5 times area and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY 2024, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated and should accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil. Thanks Bret. Yeah, I don't think we're over-earning from a gross margin standpoint. We've been very disciplined about gross margin expansion. We've been very disciplined about pricing. And what we're actually seeing in our gross margins today is we come out of the period where we had very high freight costs. We had a supply base that was very challenged from a cost standpoint when you looked at what was happening with transportation costs, wages and just overall inflation in general. As we've moved past those periods, it gives us an opportunity now to start to negotiate deflation with our supply base. And at the same time, as we took pricing during those higher inflationary periods, we're not giving back retails. So what you're actually seeing is a natural evolution of gross margins, if you will. The other thing I'll remind you is that our supply chain was particularly challenged during this time frame. And as our supply chain has improved its cost performance and its efficiencies, we're seeing some gross margin improvement in the from our supply chain. So this industry has been very, very disciplined for decades. We'll continue to be disciplined for decades. We don't believe that we're over earning and it's been a very disciplined approach to gross margin expansion and growing market share over time. Yeah. I mean, if you look at what's happened in this industry literally for decades is during periods where we have high inflation or even hyperinflation, we've raised retails to basically cover those additions and cost. And then as those cost pressures abate, this industry typically does not lower retails. So what you're seeing is the natural progression that we've seen from a gross margin standpoint as we're now in a period where things are becoming a little bit more deflationary, it gives us an opportunity to expand our margins, if you will. And we've been very disciplined about doing that as has the entire industry over this time period. Yes. And the only thing that I would add to that is that we do expect our commercial business to grow faster as we move forward. And so that naturally will put some drag on the gross margin percentage, if you will, we'll take that trade-off because it will give us an opportunity to have more gross margin dollars. So there'll likely be a mix pressure as we move forward with a faster growing commercial business. But the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing in gross margin in terms of deflation, in terms of improving supply chain profile is something that is sustainable as we move forward. Yes, I mean the math on that is we've added over the last couple of years or so, almost 600 new programs. So, we went back and retrofitted several stores that didn't have commercial programs. If you remember, historically, we ran sort of 80% to 85% of our stores have a commercial program. That number is now up over 92%. We really accelerated that over the last several quarters. So right now, we've got probably 300 to 400 immature commercial programs that are ramping up in terms of sales and efficiency and performance. And as those programs mature, it will certainly provide a tailwind to our business. So when Phil talks about this notion of our commercial business improving from an execution standpoint, we not only have that working in our favor, but we also have these maturing programs that have only been in operation for the last couple of quarters. And so if we think about the commercial business very broadly, I just keep grounding us back to this notion that we're underpenetrated. We have a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. We've put a number of things in place that are delivering and have delivered exceedingly well for us. And as we move forward, we like the competitive hand that we have with growing mega hub footprints, improving execution and adding more commercial programs it's our number one growth priority inside the company and we're all hands on deck there. And the last thing, I'll just say is as you think about commercial as you think about the back half of this year, the front half of this year, we had \u2013 we're up against 15 comp and then a 13 comp, the back half of the year, the comps get a little bit easier. So the comments that we made earlier in our prepared comments are just along the notion that the comparisons get a little bit easier. And as we have all of these things from an initiative standpoint, working in our favor, it gives us a lot of confidence about our back half execution. Yeah. I think a couple of things stand out to us. The first is that the mega hubs are growing from a commercial perspective and from an overall perspective, significantly faster than our satellite stores. And it's over 3x what we see on a total domestic business basis. So we've been very pleased with the tremendous sales lift that we're getting inside of the box, both on the DIY and the commercial side. I think the second thing that gives us a lot of confidence is we talked about this notion of testing multiple mega hubs in major metro markets. And we've done that over the last few years or so. And the idea there was to jam more Mega Hubs in a market and jam more parts closer to the customer to see really how high is high. And what we experienced in that time frame was the fact that we didn't see the kind of cannibalization that we would have anticipated, which suggested that the number of Mega Hubs that we could actually operate was significantly higher. And if you'll recall, we had Mega Hub targets that went from 100 to North of 200 over a very short period of time. So we like what we see from a sales standpoint. We like what we see from an earnings standpoint. And we -- and it's not only what we're seeing inside the four walls, but it's also the fact that these Mega Hubs are an important fulfillment source for the surrounding satellite stores. So when you put all that together in the mix, I mean, it's a pretty attractive story for us both in terms of sales and earnings and return on investments. And we're going to go as fast as we possibly can to accelerate. Yes. I mean we've invested in SG&A in a very disciplined fashion over the last several years or so. And what we've always said is that over time, SG&A growth should be in line with what we see in terms of the top line. Now in the near-term, to your point, we've invested at an accelerated pace behind technology, behind store payroll, all of those things to drive near-term growth for us. And we won't hesitate to go do that. To the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in SG&A to drive our growth initiatives, we will do that as we've done historically. As we move out and look to accelerate our store growth, there will be some drag on SG&A, but we should be able to manage that within that framework that I talked about. Yes. So what we've seen on ticket growth was something in the low single-digits right now. And we're seeing same SKU inflation somewhere in that same ZIP code, Greg. I think the important thing to recognize from an inflation standpoint is we came off a period of significantly higher inflation. That's tempered some. Most of that inflation was driven by freight. So, as freight costs have come down, we've seen some of that inflation start to come down as well. And I think the overarching point is that we're continuing to be very disciplined about pricing, where there are opportunity for us to take retail as we will do so and where there's an opportunity for us to get deflation in our cost to drive gross margin, we'll do that as well. We're not expecting sort of the same levels of inflation to drive ticket growth that we have in the last year or so. And so you should expect ticket at some point to normalize back in that low to mid-single-digit range to offset the decline that we naturally see on the DIY side from transactions. I think that's right. And as we move forward, I mean, it's a pretty dynamic environment out there even from an inflation standpoint. We'll stay very close to and be disciplined about how we manage our business. Yes. So, from an average wage standpoint, we're thrilled that we're starting to see average wages now with a two handle versus a three or four that we've seen over the last few years or so. So, as things have cooled down, we've seen some of the hyperinflation go away in the labor markets. We're now back to more normalized sort of wage inflation, if you will. Now, in terms of the investments that we're making, nearly every investment that we have from a growth initiative standpoint is underpinned by some changes in technology. Whether that's on the commercial side with what we're looking to do with some of our commercial acceleration initiatives are on the retail side, nearly all of those growth initiatives are underpinned by some changes that we're making in technology. Our technology teams have done a tremendous job doing that in a very cost-efficient way. And we -- and as we move forward, we'll continue to invest in a very disciplined way as we move forward. In terms of the commercial business and how we improve delivery. I mean we've been very efficient in terms of how we've deployed our physical assets in terms of vehicles and our people assets in terms of labor to manage that commercial business over time, and there hasn't been a meaningful change in what we're doing there. Thanks."

            "name": "Phil Daniele",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them. As we begin this morning, I'd like to say how honored I am to talk with you on behalf of our more than 120,000 AutoZoners. As today marks my first conference call as AutoZone's, President and Chief Executive Officer. At AutoZone, our first priority is to provide what we call WOW! Customer Service. This quarter, the efforts of our AutoZoners increased our total sales by 4.6% and total company same-store sales by 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Both our operating profit and earnings per share grew by a very impressive double-digit rates We continue to build on the phenomenal performance we had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere, who helped us achieve this amazing growth. Before I begin my comments regarding our second quarter sales, as a reminder, this is always our most volatile quarter to predict as the timing and severity of winter weather is both meaningful and variable. It is also our lowest sales volume quarter. This year, the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays fell on a Monday compared to Sunday last year. For commercial sales, this really mattered. Sunday is a very low sales day while Monday is one of the best. While weather across the US was very mild for the first 8 weeks of the quarter, we experienced a polar vortex and snow in the last four weeks. This extreme weather helped to propel us to stronger results in DIY, but muted our sales in commercial as snow in much of the Eastern United States, stayed on the ground for an extended period of time. Again, weather extremes either hot or cold, drive hard part failures and accelerate maintenance over time. For the second quarter, our total company same-store sales were 1.5% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story in an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, we will continue reporting on our international performance. We encourage you to focus on the same-store sales, constant currency number where International, again, had a strong quarter, up 10.6%. We are very excited about the short and long-term growth prospects internationally, and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years. Our domestic same-store sales were up 0.3% this quarter compared to 1.2% last quarter and 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Breaking our 12 weeks of sales into the first eight weeks and then the last four weeks, you can see the impact of the holiday shift and the weather volatility. Domestically, we ran a negative 1.8% comp across the first eight weeks and a positive 4.4% comp in the last four weeks. This was even more pronounced when splitting these time frames up between commercial and DIY. Our commercial business grew 2.7% against very strong sales last year of 13.1%. Although our commercial business finished stronger than we started, our results were below our expectations. Across the 12-week quarter, we were up 4.1% for the first four weeks, then down 0.7% over the second four-week segment and up 4.4% over the last four weeks. Although better in the last four weeks segment, of the quarter, our sales were depressed due to the winter storms shutting down many commercial customers, particularly in the mid-south. The holiday shift combined with weather negatively impacted our sales by roughly 2% for the quarter. Despite all this volatility in commercial sales, we are encouraged that we finished the quarter stronger. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on over time. Improved satellite and store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technology enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times in commercial, while very early, we are encouraged by the initial results. In commercial, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. In Q2, we opened 20 net new commercial programs. We now have commercial programs in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales for Q2. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rates will improve as we move through the year. Sales growth comparisons get easier in the back half of the year and our execution, customer delivery times, in-stock levels, and parts availability continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 0.3% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of positive 2.7%. DIY ran 0.7% across the first four weeks of the quarter, a negative 6.2% across the second four-week segment and a positive 4.8% comp over the last four weeks. The last four-week time segment was accelerated due to the winter weather, as a reminder, last year, the polar vortex hit in the second four-week segment. I'd like to add some color on our regional performance as well. The Northeast and the Midwest markets underperformed the remainder of the country by 500 basis points in the middle four-week segment, only to swing to a positive 1,250 basis points overperformance for the last four-week segment. For the quarter, we saw a 270 basis point favorable performance in the Northeast and the Midwest versus the remainder of the country. Although the Midwest had some extreme cold, we frankly would like to see more winter weather along the East Coast markets, where the winter has been persistently mild for more than two years now. Overall, for the quarter, the West performed least favorably. Headed into the third quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern, meaning we feel weather will not play a big story, one way or the other. Our Q3 performance is always contingent on a normalized tax refund season and we expect this year to be similar to last year. Regarding our merchandise categories and DIY business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback, particularly from the low-end consumer. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down 2.2%, while our ticket average was up 1.7%. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from higher inflation last year. We attribute our share gains to improve customer service levels in our store, and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels driven by improved productivity in our distribution centers. While we are up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress. We've made many changes across the organization. From doubling down on many of our long-term execution processes, ensuring that we are hiring the best AutoZoners and reducing turnover, our execution is improving, and we're making steady progress. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 859 stores opened internationally or 12% of our total store base, the business had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And finally, before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our overarching objectives for fiscal 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and believe our improved service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We also continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight and drive improved availability. First is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we're making good progress on transforming our distribution network. We have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction in the US, Chowchilla, California and New Kent, Virginia. We are also nearing the completion of our expanded Tepeji, Mexico distribution center. Additionally, we have broken ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey distribution center. Our strategy is focusing on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed and expanded parts availability and improved efficiency. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Thank you, Jamere. I want to stress how proud I am to represent the company as only the fifth CEO over the almost 45 years we have been in business. As you've heard, we have a lot of initiatives in flight and we have a great team of AutoZoners in place to take us to the next level. We truly believe we will continue to improve from here. We are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margin margins are solid, and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital expenditures where it matters most. Our stores, our distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in various stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on the new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.6%, much higher than our domestic comps. International has been strong for several years now. While I mentioned all these investments in FY 2024, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. While Q2 was below our expectations, we believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the remainder of the year. We know our focus on parts availability and wow customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Good morning, Chris. Yes. So if you kind of segmented the business, I think an area of customer growth on the commercial side that's been more challenged has been the folks that are more focused on under car. So think brakes, suspension, those types of areas related to the tire, one of the four corners of the car, those have probably been the areas that have been more challenged. So for us, that's categories like brakes and suspension, which we talked quite extensively about that over the last year. And that's probably been where we've been most challenged, but I'll go back to the growth opportunities we have in the commercial. At the end of the day, we still have pretty low share and there's a big opportunity for us to continue to grow share in both terms of share of wallet for the customer as well as new customers. I would say the national accounts, depending on who they are, they can be wildly positive or negative depending on as you pick up business or your mature business, et cetera. I probably should have mentioned another area that's been challenged for us really for the last 18 months has been the Buy here, Pay here segment in the used car segment. Those have been pretty challenged as well, as they've struggled with inventory. They had incredible sales coming out of the pandemic, and that's probably been a pretty challenged segment as well. We're effectively two weeks into our quarter, a couple of weeks into our quarter. And the taxes may be pushed back a week or two. But I think over the 12-week quarter, we expect them to be pretty similar to last year and it's -- the vast majority of the taxes should land well within our 12-week time frame. So maybe slightly moved back a little bit, but not meaningful to the quarter. We expect it to be normal. Good morning, Bret. Well, on the -- sorry, just to make sure I'm clear on your question. Questions relative to the WDs or to the actual-- Yes, I think it's hard to tell exactly what's going on in their business. But from my sense -- and we see it in our business as well. The vast majority of the supply chain constraints that you had in the latter half of the pandemic have resolved themselves, for the most part, we'll still continue to improve. In stocks are not quite back to where they were previous to the pandemic. I suspect they will continue to improve slightly. And I would also think that the vast majority of the WDs that had the inventory issues in the latter half of the pandemic have probably recovered for the most part. So, I think they're better, but I don't think they're going to have -- they're not going to materially get better over the next short period of time. I would say everybody is pretty much back to slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels. Yes, I would say we have -- I mean, we've got two markets that we're trying to expand in today, which are obviously Mexico and Brazil. And we like where we are in our international footprint. Canada is interesting. I would say -- I would never say we would not look at Canada, but it does have a pretty solid competitive base up there. And we just think there's better opportunities for us at the moment in the current markets that we have. We've got plenty of expansion opportunities in both markets, and we like our performance internationally. It doesn't mean we never go to Canada, but it's not a focus for us at the moment. No. You got six months left in 2024. In our 2024 anyway. Thanks Bret. Hey Michael, great question, and thanks for the question. At the end of the day, we have -- let me go back to our comment on share. We have very low share in this marketplace. I think we will improve from here. Can I tell you exactly when we're going to get back to double-digit growth? No. I would expect that we would grow faster. We have initiatives in place that we'll think we will accelerate our sales growth, particularly in the back half of this year, and it will continue. To nail the date when I think we get back to a positive double-digit number is frankly tough to do. There's a lot of variables in there. I think we'll see consistent share growth and consistent same-store sales and total growth in the commercial market for a long time to come, probably because we have -- we're better than we were as we continue to expand our hubs and mega hubs, improve our assortments and take share, we see a long-term growth trajectory for the commercial side of the business. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yes. The part of your question there is what are we doing that have helped stabilize our business and get it back on a more stable footing. Our in-stocks have come back to very close to pre-pandemic levels. We've expanded our hubs and our Mega Hubs. We have a long way to go to get to our ultimate goals of North of 200 Mega Hubs. And significantly more hubs as well. Those put hard-to-find parts in the market where we can get those parts to our commercial customers, in particular, faster. It also helps DIY. It will take us quite a few innings, if you will, to get to more than 200 of those hubs. They just take longer to set up and get in place. But that is improving our efforts on delivery times. We've put in -- we've invested in technology. We've been talking about this for quite some time. We continue to leverage the technology we put in the hands of our commercial AutoZoners, and we've got some tests in place in some early innings where we're able to show better delivery times by enabling better technology and leveraging that technology. So that will take time to roll out and it will take time for our AutoZoners to digest the change management. So in the quarter of -- in the number of innings, if we're going to play baseball, which starts pretty soon this year, we'll -- maybe we're in the third or the fourth inning. But hopefully, we'll have a rally in the ninth inning. Yes. On the SG&A front, I would we have investments that are some in CapEx, some obviously in SG&A. To the degree we can invest and grow sales and EBIT dollars, we'll make those investments all day every day. I think over time, you should see us get our EBIT -- our SG&A growth should start to bend down slightly. I wouldn't expect a radical change, but we've had a lot of investments as we continue to improve our operational efficiencies in our distribution centers, in our stores, as our AutoZoners get longer tenured and we hold on and reduce turnover things of that nature, they will obviously start bringing down some of the SG&A on the margins. But we would invest in a kind of -- I think maybe part of your question is, would we take lower margin rates in commercial as a mix of sales like Jamere mentioned to get higher gross profit dollars? Absolutely. I think we can slightly expand our margins on both DIY and commercial over time? Yes. And in an effort to increase EBIT dollars, we'll do that all day long. Those are good exchanges for us. Thanks Simeon. Yes. We're extremely excited about both of our -- both our hub and our mega hub strategy. And I'll use the previous comments around innings. We think we'll have well north of 200 mega hub and significantly larger growth of hubs. We're roughly in the third inning or so in hub growth -- mega hub growth. If you kind of said that, that strategy works for us. We see significantly higher growth in those stores -- those types of stores, and they help feed harder to find inventory to what we call our satellite stores, the markets that are close to those hubs. So, yes, we believe that is the right strategy. We will continue to modify and enhance our assortment strategies in both our satellite stores and our mega hubs and hubs to get more relevant inventory closer to the customer. The faster we can get those hard-to-find parts into the shop, the better we will grow market share. And by the way, all of that inventory we add for the commercial customer also finds its way to sales on the DIY customer. In fact, let me add a little bit on to that, too, specifically around new stores, and I'll maybe take a little bit of a history lesson here. If you go back to FY 2017 or those types of number of years, our productivity per store, we have been on a pretty heavy diet of opening up new programs. And then we decided, from a strategy perspective, we would slow down our new store openings for commercial and really start trying to drive per store productivity. Back then, our per store productivity was in the $7,000 to $8,000 range. Today, as Jamere quoted earlier in the prepared comments, we're significantly higher than that. The other thing that's happened is as we open up new programs in today's environment versus years ago, they are maturing at a faster rate and get to a higher, more plateaued rate. So we like that math. We're probably not going to open up 60 or 600 stores in the next two years or so like we have over the recent history. That will probably slow a little bit. But we like the way the new stores come out of the box and the maturity curves that we get versus, frankly, 2017 or 2018. Thanks. Thank you. Go back over long periods of time, decades, I mean, this industry has had a slight decline in transactions and units and an increase in ticket average and average unit retails in that somewhere between 2% to 4% range on average, predominantly because of changes in technology, better parts, and some -- it's great to think about belts on a car. Used to -- the average car used to have belts on it today, they have one. And the belt used to be $4 or $5 today about maybe $60 or $70. So that technology change is probably going to continue. And that's been -- it's been a pretty understandable decline in units and a change in average unit retail and we generally have pretty good line of sight to this because the product development takes years and an item may stay in our stores for 20 years. It's the beauty of having a -- frankly, a lower term business that's very predictable. Thank you. Yeah. It's -- thank you for the question. And it's early innings in that. We've been testing some stuff, how to use the data we've had our -- if you think about our handhelds and a lot of technology enhancements that we made over the last couple of years, and now we've got a pretty robust set of data where we can look and figure out what are the best and most efficient ways to use our assets, both human assets, our great AutoZoners and our trucks and where the inventory is, how do we get the part to the customer the fastest to improve customer service? It is early innings, but we like what we see, and we're in the process of rolling that out. There's some change management that we have to work through. There's some changes in technology that our AutoZoners need to be comfortable with and some changes in operations in the stores. But we like what we see, and we've had some pauses and evaluate and then move a little further, pause and evaluate and move a little further, but we're happy with what we see, and we think it will improve customer service to the shop, and we'll get the parts faster to the customer without having to drive the car any faster because we want to be safe. I'll say two things have happened. One is -- and we've mentioned it a couple of different times. We've if you think about staffing in whole, it's not back to pre-pandemic levels, but it's better than it was during the pandemic. We still have work to do to get retention and turnover back down to pre-pandemic levels, both in our stores and in our distribution centers, but improving, and we like the trends that we're seeing, although we'd love it to be faster. The other thing we did on commercial, and Jamere has mentioned it a couple of times, we've opened up roughly 600 stores in slightly over two years. As we did that, obviously, that takes your -- the commercial specialists and the TSMs and things of that nature, those really high caliber of people that were concentrated in some stores, we expanded pretty quickly. So you got new promotions and people got to learn their job and learn those new shops and get really ingrained with those long-term relationships, and that will continue to get better as we move forward. So it's kind of two elements. Thank you. Appreciate the question. I think we have time for one last call. Hi, Brian. Yes. I mean, to say we're falling down the list. I don't think that would be a good characterization. Is there always opportunities to improve? The answer is yes. Go back to our share comments that we've made several times we still have under 5% share, we believe. And as we get better and mature in relationships, open up new stores, get better in new stores and drive parts availability and what we call internally time to shop. The quicker we can get those parts to the shop, the better we'll be. And this -- I think there's a bit of a misnomer that a customer has a first call. They all -- nobody has every part that's needed in a particular shop. So a customer will have multiple people they call. we think we will continually move up the call list and gain a larger share of wallet for each customer, but to say that you're always first call with any particular customers, that's pretty rare for a customer to put all of their eggs in one basket because nobody's got all the parts. It's virtually impossible. There's too many SKUs. So I think we will continue to get better. I think we've gotten better from where we were, and we've got a long road in front of us to continue to take market share and gain new customers. Yes. Great question, and time will tell. We're not completely through winter weather, as you said. I think if I could lay out the weather calendar that I'd love to have, like I said, I would love to have more really cold winter in the big cities on the eastern seaboard. I mean if you're in New York, you've got a little bit of snow this year and it was gone within 24 hours. It's a heck of a lot more than you got last year. But New York, Philadelphia, D.C., those areas really haven't had a lot of really extreme cold weather. The Midwest did and the eastern half of the Northeast or the western half. I'm sorry, I got some pretty cold weather. But the big metro cities along the East Coast just really haven't for more than two years now. So I would love to have had more there, but that's something that we can't control. We're going to do our best to go grow market share in those company -- in those areas of the country, no matter what. So thanks for the follow-up question. Thank you. All right. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment and reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position, and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers do have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed in the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and drive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident, AutoZone will be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call."

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman and CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours.\nBill Rhodes: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2024 first quarter conference call. With me today are Phil Daniele, CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin this morning, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their contributions during the quarter that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states, we lead with putting customers first, which allowed us to grow our total sales by 5.1% while both are operating profit and earnings per share, grew by very impressive high-teens rates. As we have previously said, we have been able to continually build on the phenomenal performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023. Our leadership team and I continue to be impressed with our post-pandemic sales performance. To put this in perspective, our FY 2019 sales were $11.6 billion and now our trailing four quarter sales are $17.7 billion, a 50% plus increase over a four-year time horizon. Congratulations AutoZoners everywhere who made that enormous success possible. For the first quarter, our total company same-store sales were 3.4% and 2.1% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story and an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, last quarter we began disclosing our global sales comp. We encourage you to focus on the constant currency number where international again had a strong quarter of 10.9%. Both our Mexican and Brazilian same-store sales had double-digit growth. We are very excited about the short- and long-term growth prospects of international. Our expectations are we will continue to grow both mature store volumes both in DIY and DIFM and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years, ultimately getting to a minimum of 200 international new stores by 2028. Next, our domestic same-store sales were up 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.7% last quarter and 5.6% in Q1 of last year. Our performance in retail was slightly below our expectations, but still, still resilient in the current environment. Breaking our sales into three, four-week segments, our DIY same-store sales were roughly 1% for both the first and last four-week segments, but were negative 2% in the middle four weeks or October. Commercial sales on the other hand accelerated for the quarter, but we started stronger than we finished. As you know some of the comparisons over the last few years were distorted. And on a three-year basis, the performance of each of the businesses this quarter was remarkably similar. Our commercial business grew 5.7% against exceptionally strong comps last year. Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the new initiatives we have in place to accelerate top-line growth in commercial, and those efforts are having a positive impact on our performance. And as we further analyzed our DIY and DIFM results and specifically our second period sales slowdown, our retail business was clearly impacted on a regional basis as we saw a 70 basis-point performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. We continue to attribute this gap in performance to the lack of winter weather last year and lack of snowfall. But enough about what happened to us. While not satisfied with our sales performance, we are encouraged as we enjoyed both, dollar and unit share gains in our domestic and retail businesses -- domestic retail and commercial businesses. We previously highlighted that we were not executing at peak levels, and we are encouraged to share that we are seeing steady progress. Our in-stock levels are nearing pre-pandemic levels. Turnover, while still elevated is beginning to decline. Productivity levels in our distribution centers have improved. The technology we deployed to improve service levels to commercial customers is seeing much higher adoption rates, leading to decreased delivery times and we have opened a significant number of new commercial programs, reaching 92% domestic penetration for the first time in our history. Even more encouraging is the continued strength in sales we are seeing from those new program openings as many are only weeks old. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil?\nPhil Daniele: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Our domestic same store sales were 1.2% this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 5.6% growth. While we were up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress with more room for improvement. I want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago that we\u2019ve made many changes across the organization from reinstituting many of our long-term processes to placing share of voice in vitally important areas, ensuring we are hiring the right AutoZoners, and execution is improving meaningfully. Our domestic commercial business grew 5.7%. We still have work to do, but we were pleased with the improvements we saw in this business. As the business began improving, we believe we grew share and set another record for the quarter with $1.1 billion in commercial sales. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales for quarter one. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years: improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, adding new hubs and mega hubs, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technological enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently, with improvements in delivery times and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q1, we opened 121 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them in the back half of the quarter. 69 of those 121 programs opened in weeks 7 through 12 of the quarter. While programs that opened late in the quarter have minimal sales impact on the quarter, they do position us for sales growth for the remainder of FY24 and beyond. As Bill previously shared, I want to reiterate, we now have commercial in approximately 92% of our domestic stores. When I was SVP of Commercial, we didn\u2019t have line of sight to reaching that level of penetration. It really is a great sign of the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last five years or so. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rate should improve as we move through the year as comps get easier and our execution will continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had flat comps this quarter on top of last year\u2019s comp of 2.6%. While the data we have available to us indicates we continue to gain share in both dollars and units, our comp is below our expectations, but in line with what we are seeing across the industry. Regarding weather, it was quite mild this quarter. It is this time of year when our sales will fade as the summer sales slow down into winter. This year, October was warmer than last year, and sales in weather sensitive hard part categories in the Midwest and the Northeast underperformed the remainder of the country. While our retail comp was flat for the quarter, we saw the first four weeks comp up 1%, the second four weeks comp down 2%, and the last four weeks comp up 0.7%. While our performance clearly improved over the last four weeks of the quarter, we fell short of our own expectations for retail for the full quarter. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives part failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter\u2019s traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 1.6%, while our ticket was up similarly. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 3% to 4% range as we get further removed from the large increases from last year due to significant inflation, particularly due to freight costs. Regarding our commercial trends, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 230 basis-point worse performance between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As the Northeast and the Midwest experienced a very mild winter last year with below average snowfall, we sold less weather-sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Heading into the second quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern. But as a reminder, the Q2 is always our most volatile quarter as weather fluctuations can be extreme, meaningfully impacting our short-term sales performance, either positively or negatively. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback from customers. We do feel the low-end consumer started pulling back on discretionary purchases. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw low-single-digit inflation and as a result our ticket was up roughly 1.5%. We believe inflation for the second quarter will be similar as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels, lapping very high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very-disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost, and we believe we have entered into one of those periods. For the second quarter, we expect our DIY sales to remain more difficult and our commercial sales trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I\u2019d like to highlight and give some color on a few of our other key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability: one is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts, and secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our distribution network. Along with having two domestic distribution centers currently under construction, our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive growth with speed and expanded availability and efficiency. Additionally, we plan to continue to grow internationally. At 840 store -- 849 stores opened internationally, or 12% of our total store base, these businesses had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\nJamere Jackson: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As both Bill and Phil have previously discussed, we had a solid first quarter stacked on top of an impressive first quarter last year with 5.1% total company sales growth, 1.2% domestic comp growth, 10.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 17.4% increase in EBIT, and an 18.6% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have continued to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 5.1%, and let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, our domestic DIFM sales increased 5.7% to $1.1 billion and were up 20.6% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $15,900, down 0.6%. It\u2019s important to point out that our sales per program productivity was again impacted by a large number of immature programs that have opened over the last five quarters. While these openings depress the point in time productivity metric, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. We have intentionally opened more stores with commercial programs in response to the tremendous opportunity we see to grow our market share. We now have a commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we\u2019re building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 121 net new programs, finishing with 5,803 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we continue to have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 100 mega hub locations with 2 new mega hubs open in Q1. The 100 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of commercial programs and grew more than 2 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q1. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continued to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 mega hubs at full build out. These are difficult to find boxes in the right locations, but we are keenly focused on rapid expansion and have 45 currently in the pipeline and growing. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was essentially flat for the quarter. As mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.6%, offset by 1.5% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q1, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the balance of FY24. I\u2019ll now say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making internationally. Our same-store sales grew 25.1% on an actual basis and 10.9% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 5 stores in Mexico to finish with 745 stores and 4 stores in Brazil ending with 104. We remain committed to international and given our success, we\u2019re bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.8%, up 279 basis points, driven primarily by a noncash $81 million LIFO charge in last year\u2019s quarter versus a $2 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 70 basis-point improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter\u2019s 37 basis-point improvement. We\u2019ve had exceptional gross margin improvement and in fact, we\u2019re at the highest gross margin rate we\u2019ve had since FY 2021. I will point out that we now have $57 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We\u2019re currently modeling $5 million in LIFO credits for Q2 based on the deflation experienced in Q1. And as I\u2019ve said previously, once we credit back the $57 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.4% versus last year\u2019s Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 68 basis points. The increase in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We\u2019re committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $849 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year favorable comparison. Interest expense for the quarter was $91.4 million, up 58% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $6.3 billion at Q1 end last year. We\u2019re planning interest expense in the $98 million range for the second quarter of FY24 versus $65.6 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.6% and up from last year\u2019s first quarter of 18.9%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 147 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 446 basis points. For the second quarter of FY24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, up 10% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.2 million was 7.2% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.55, up 18.6% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the first quarter, we generated $600 million in free cash flow. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q1 at 2.5 times EBITDAR, returning to our long-term target. Our inventory per store was up 0.3% versus last year while total inventory increased 3%, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $197,000 versus negative $249,000 last year, and negative $201,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 124.4% versus last year\u2019s 131%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1.5 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $300 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 3% of the shares outstanding in the quarter. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We\u2019re growing our market share, expanding our margins, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY24, we\u2019re bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is reaccelerating. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Phil.\nPhil Daniele: Thank you, Jamere. During the quarter, we launched our new fiscal year, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss the key takeaways from our national sales meeting in September. At the meeting, we launched our operating theme for the New Year, Live the Pledge. While we have used this theme previously, it continues to deeply resonate with our AutoZoners. Simply put, it differentiates us from everyone else. The energy at the event has never been higher. The pledge is the core of our culture, and I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never overemphasize our culture. It is defined by helping solve our customers\u2019 challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It is based on a team-based approach of recognizing everyone\u2019s contributions and performance, putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. And it\u2019s about caring about people, both our customers and our AutoZoners. It\u2019s about providing unparalleled career opportunities to a diverse population of AutoZoners. And it\u2019s about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility, and it\u2019s so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategy succinctly. Fiscal 2024\u2019s top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hubs and hubs. Construction on our new distribution centers and the optimization of our new direct import facility are a focus, as we are also ramping up our domestic and international store growth to achieve 500 annual new store openings by 2028. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now. While I mentioned all of these investments in FY24, the number one focus for the remainder of the year will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish for the remainder of this year. Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on our leadership transition plan. Next month, Bill will become Executive Chair and I will become President and CEO. It will be one of the greatest honors of my life to move into that role. And while that role will come with new opportunities and challenges, I continue to be very bullish about the prospects because I know we have an extraordinary culture and a terrific industry and as you have seen, an ever-evolving but exceptional team. As Bill and I both continue to say, and it may sound a little bit clich\u00e9, and we both believe it. AutoZone\u2019s best days lie ahead of us. I want to thank Bill for his wonderful nearly 19-year tenure leading this company and thank him for his leadership. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to continue to leverage him and his experiences in this new role as Executive Chair. I also want to thank three other long-term senior leaders for their amazing contributions to our success Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel with their respective 34, 27, and 10 years of service to AutoZone. They have had an enormous contributions, and their legacies will be evident in the teams they have built and the contributions those teams will make over the coming decades. I congratulate each of them and wish Grant and Bonnie, Charlie and Doris, and Al and Sue well earned happiness in their next chapters. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Can we talk a bit more about the international margins, since that\u2019s going to be more impactful, how it compares to what you see in the U.S.? And I guess Brazil versus Mexico, is there much difference? And is there, I guess, an investment phase that is going to be required to ramp that?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. I mean from a margin standpoint, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on margins, both gross margins and total operating margins. In our business in Mexico, which is much more mature than obviously what we have in Brazil, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the actions we\u2019ve been able to take on the merchandising side of the business, and that\u2019s given us a very healthy gross margin in that business. And then, if you also think about the inherent advantages that you have from a cost structure standpoint, particularly with wage rates and labor, it\u2019s a very attractive operating margin structure in Mexico. And we believe as our business in Brazil matures and scales over time that we\u2019ll see similar advantages in Brazil. So net-net, what we\u2019re doing on the international side, while it\u2019s a fast-growing business, it\u2019s also going to have a lot of margin calories that come along with it.\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I think I would also add, we continue to say that in Brazil, we\u2019re still losing money there. So we\u2019re in an investment phase. We\u2019re ramping up our store count very aggressively. But with that comes some operating losses that are kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last five or six years.\nBret Jordan: I guess, what kind of scale do you need to tip Brazil into profitability? I mean the incremental margin would seem to be very high in that case.\nBill Rhodes: I think that\u2019s right, Bret. But frankly, we have a lot of -- a whole lot of very new stores that are in very new markets as we\u2019re expanding. I mean, we\u2019ve opened 40 stores or so in the last 18 months. And those stores are very immature. So, we\u2019ve got to see how those new stores and new markets mature. Right now, they\u2019re causing a pretty good headwind but not unanticipated.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Quick follow-up. The U.S. Do-It-For-Me, any channel dispersion, national account, tire service chains versus independents performance?\nPhil Daniele: Yes, there is. If you kind of looked at the business, and talking about the big traditional nationals and the up and down the street or the local shop, those folks have performed pretty well. The national accounts, particularly the ones that are focused on tires, have been where we\u2019ve struggled the most. And this really goes back to a lot of the weather conversations we had from last year, those tire organizations just aren\u2019t getting the tires off at the same rate. They take the tire off, they see the calipers frozen or lots of rust on those parts in there and they get the job. That\u2019s just not happening at the same rate it has previously.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Given the performance of the domestic commercial business this quarter, while there was an acceleration, it did fall short of that double-digit level that you had anticipated over the long run. Do you still think this is an achievable goal eventually? And is it more dependent on the performance of the industry to be stronger in order for AutoZone to achieve that goal?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. Thanks. It\u2019s great question. I think as we said, we\u2019re slightly disappointed with our commercial growth for this particular quarter. We\u2019re happy to accelerate it, but we frankly thought it would accelerate a little bit faster. We\u2019re happy with the progress that we\u2019re making. And to your question about double-digit long term, yes, we think we can get back to those types of growth numbers over time, particularly because we have such low share percent on the commercial side of the business in that 4% to 5% range. So over a long time, we believe we will be able to continue to expand our market share. And as we continue to have these newer stores that we\u2019ve opened over the last five quarters continue to mature and we continue to improve our execution, we believe we will continue to grow our comps in the DIFM space.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is on the gross margin. It seems like there is a benefit right now from costs coming down, retail is remaining stable. How long is that sustainable? And is there a case where it might make sense to roll back some prices in certain areas in order to drive the retail business to grow a bit faster in the coming quarters? Thank you.\nJamere Jackson: Yes. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on gross margins, and it\u2019s really comprised of two pieces. Number one, from a merchandising margin standpoint, we\u2019ve done a great job inside our merchandising organization of finding cost opportunities and pricing opportunities that have given us accretive gross margins, and we\u2019re doing a tremendous job there. Second element of that, quite frankly, has been the work that we\u2019ve done inside the supply chain. If you recall, our supply chain was under tremendous pressure over the last couple of years or so from a cost standpoint, and we\u2019re now starting to see some benefits as some of those pressures have abated. But if you look at this business over the long term, I mean, we have historically been able to churn out positive gross margin improvements in a very-disciplined fashion over time. And that has enabled us to grow our earnings very predictably as we move forward. And when we think about the pricing environment, as we\u2019ve said and we continue to reiterate, pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. We don\u2019t feel like we need to make any pricing investments at this point to be able to operate the business and grow share. But if we do have to make those moves, we\u2019ll certainly do those, if it results in us improving units and ultimately growing EBIT. But at this point, we\u2019re in pretty good shape in terms of where we are from a pricing standpoint and feel that we\u2019re very competitive in the marketplace.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Max Rakhlenko from TD Cowen.\nMax Rakhlenko: So first, can you speak to the competitive environment and if you\u2019re seeing any changes there? And then how would you frame the level of competition today from the WDs compared to both a couple of quarters ago as well as pre-pandemic?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. I\u2019ll break that up into two parts. If you think about the DIY competition, we\u2019ve had a very stable base of competitors there for a very long period of time. That business is pretty stable, and there\u2019s not a whole lot of new or changing strategies that appears from the competition. On the DIFM side, if you kind of think about our -- what we call our close-in competitors or the public folks, not a lot of changes there other than what O\u2019Reilly did 1.5-year ago or so on their pricing strategy. On the WD side, I think you kind of have to look at pandemic time versus today, one of the things that we believe is they really struggled with some in-stock in some key categories over the pandemic. Over the last, say, a year or so, it appears that they have become more in-stock on those key categories, like everybody has, but they were probably more acutely impacted than a lot of the public players, and they\u2019ve returned to more normal levels. As a reminder, we are still not back to our pre-pandemic levels of in-stock, but we\u2019re pretty darn close.\nMax Rakhlenko: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then you guys touched on delivery times improving a few times throughout the prepared remarks. So, can you speak to what your average delivery times are now in the markets where you\u2019ve got the megas? And then how much more room do you have to improve? And then just the cadence we should think about in order to get there?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. Yes, just delivery times can be wildly different depending on proximity of the part and how close that shop may be to a given store or a hub or mega hub. And the delivery times on mega hub inventory or what we call expanded parts can differ wildly if it has to be relayed through a store or delivered directly. Our average delivery times, you\u2019re kind of thinking in that 30-minute range. So, a 10% improvement in delivery times is pretty meaningful, but it may be 3 to 5 minutes, and that matters when a customer is sitting there trying to turn their bay. So we believe we\u2019ll continue to leverage and improve our delivery times. And that\u2019s a key strategy for us because it\u2019s a measure of customer service.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers: Congratulations to everybody. So I wanted to follow up on the question more broadly about the consumer. You talked about some of the tire businesses remaining weak. You talked about some discretionary front-room pressure in DIY. I guess, how much of this do you think is just a deferral that\u2019s building that you typically see as a category and as you start to see the slowdown in the consumer front, consumer starts to defer? Are you seeing evidence of that? And do you think we\u2019re still in the point of that sort of getting worse before ultimately that demand potentially releases?\nBill Rhodes: That\u2019s a terrific question, Chris. Let\u2019s step back and talk about this on a long-term basis first. If you think about the retail business, which we have much more experience in the retail business and you think about it over long periods of time, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about the strength of the consumer, much more so when tough times happen, i.e., recessions, those have been the periods where we\u2019ve outperformed more so than any other periods of time. So, we don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time on the consumer. We certainly see in the retail business, there\u2019s some trading down going down the good, better, best product assortments. I think in the commercial side, we have suppositions that we haven\u2019t yet proven because we haven\u2019t been in that business at this level for an extended period of time. I believe we think that there may be some consumers that are trading from DIFM into DIY in certain jobs as they\u2019re trying to save money. The thing I would encourage us all to focus on more so than minor fluctuations in consumer sentiment. As we enter the second quarter, the one thing I always worry about is the weather patterns in the second quarter are extremely volatile, and they can have big impacts on our performance, both positive and negative. And as we\u2019ve said, those impacts of the weather, particularly in the Rust Belt, can have ongoing implications as we get into the spring and summer and even the fall months. If we get significant snow and ice, particularly in the Rust Belt in the Northeast, that bodes well for us. If we don\u2019t, then we\u2019re going to have a little bit of a challenge. To me, that is the more impactful thing that\u2019s going to happen in the near term than consumer sentiment.\nChris Horvers: And so as a follow-up to that, I think last year, December was pretty good in terms of the weather impact, right? So, it would seem like as you look past today, the comparison gets tough, but it was a record warm winter last year. So, I guess, as you look into your crystal ball, do you think there\u2019s sort of -- ends up being a bit of a weaker start and stronger finish to the second quarter?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. It\u2019s interesting, Chris, because the beginning of the quarter last year, there was no weather. We had significant weather around the holidays for a couple of weeks and thought, okay, here we go on, our business responded really, really well. And then the January, February, into March, particularly in the Rust Belt, it was lack of snow and ice and fairly moderate temperatures. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a meteorologist on staff either. And at the end of the day, we\u2019re running this business for not quarters, not years, but for decades. And the weather implications, they\u2019re going to even out. I just always try to make sure and caution everybody at the beginning of the second quarter that we could have really strong performance and we can have really weak performances driven by weather, and that doesn\u2019t need to change how we approach our strategy over the long term.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on commercial. It seems like you\u2019ve really accelerated the rollout of new programs over the last few quarters, obviously, at a time when sales growth on a comp basis has been lower. So, can you just help us better understand what driving that decision right now, particularly as we think about your comment around in-stock levels improving, but not necessarily where you want it to be. So, how do we think about that thought process around accelerating right now?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. If you -- and I even mentioned it in the prepared remarks, if we go back to when I was SVP of Commercial, the facts are, our per store performance has improved on a per store basis, the productivity of those individual stores. Looking back over a decade\u2019s worth of time, we went through this phase where we had less than 50% of our stores or around 50% of our stores had commercial. And we slowly -- not slowly, we ramped up to roughly 70 -- high-70s, low-80% of our stores in commercial. Then, we had a period of time where we really focused on per store productivity. And that\u2019s been going on for the last several years, say, 5 to 7 years. Today, we\u2019re at a spot where we\u2019ve had stores that previously didn\u2019t have commercial in them, and we\u2019ve looked at the market differently with a much different share ownership, where we believe those stores are now productive and we\u2019re opening them. If you kind of forecasted that out into the future, we think we\u2019ve probably opened the vast majority of those stores that previously didn\u2019t have commercial. There\u2019ll probably be some, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see this large opening of previously opened stores that didn\u2019t have commercial programs that do today. But we think those stores over time will be as productive as the stores we have that have been open for a long period of time, and we like that productivity model going into the future.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. And then just a follow-up would be around thinking about the investments that may be required to drive that improvement in commercial. And I think this was talked about in a few different ways, including around pricing, but I\u2019m thinking more from an OpEx, from an SG&A perspective. It\u2019s been growing at a relatively steady 4% rate per store. That seems reasonable. But I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about that? How you\u2019re planning for that throughout this year? And whether you need to start to see a pickup in your SG&A growth?\nJamere Jackson: We like the investment profile that we have today. And we have been very, very clear that we\u2019re investing in SG&A at a pretty accelerated pace and have done so over the last couple of years or so, and that\u2019s come in the form of store payroll, particularly around our commercial program, but also IT. And these are the kinds of things that are enabling us to drive the growth initiative in commercial. For example, Phil mentioned what we\u2019re doing on delivery times. The work that we\u2019re doing to improve our delivery times is all underpinned by investments that we\u2019ve made in technology that make it easier for us to deploy drivers and, quite frankly, give us a better opportunity to tell our customers exactly where our drivers are in the route and how fast they\u2019re going to get the parts. So, those are some of the examples of things that we\u2019ve invested in, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. And that investment profile is going to pay dividends for us, in terms of speed, in terms of productivity and in terms of better results, in terms of customer service.\nPhil Daniele: You also -- you mentioned price, specifically on the DIFM side. And although we made a price investment several years ago, today, we like our pricing strategy. Now, the pricing is always a pretty dynamic point of our business, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that. But we like where we are from a pricing strategy today. So we don\u2019t see any major or deviation from our current pricing strategy.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: So when you look at the sequential uptick in your commercial business, but also a sequential downtick in DIY, can you help us parse out the impact of broader industry trends versus your own idiosyncratic factors? And as you put these together, is it fair to say that you expect Q2 and fiscal \u201824 as a whole to look a lot like Q1, or are there factors that give you confidence in both DIY and commercial acceleration as we move through the year, even if the industry is slowing?\nBill Rhodes: Yes. I\u2019ll separate the two. First of all, we\u2019ve been in the retail business for a very long time. We\u2019ve had lots of periods of time where we grow in the 0% to 2% kind of range. We\u2019re coming off a period of time in the pandemic where our retail volumes went up 25% to 30%. And we are, frankly, tickled to death to still be holding on to those retail volumes, and we believe we\u2019ve retained about 85% of the share that we gained during that three-year period of time. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. We always want to grow faster. We\u2019re basically flat this quarter. We\u2019re trying new things, but we\u2019re pleased with where we are in the retail business. We aren\u2019t pleased with where we are in the commercial business. But let\u2019s don\u2019t forget, this quarter\u2019s comp of 5.7% is comping against about a 15% comp last year. So while we didn\u2019t meet our goals or aspirations in the quarter, 5% or 2%, we\u2019re not disappointed. We\u2019re not discouraged. We know we have a long runway to go in the commercial business. Again, we\u2019re going to play this in decades, not quarters and years. We feel like that depending on the weather in the second quarter, it\u2019s probably going to look similar to plus or minus 1% or 2%, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Our hope and our plan is to accelerate, particularly on the commercial side of the business as we enter the second half of the year and we continue to improve our execution.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then for Jamere, I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin, up about 280 basis points. I think you said about 208 basis points of that was LIFO. So first question is, how do you expect the LIFO impact to trend in Q2 and going forward? And then, if we look at the other 70 basis points of benefit from the supply chain and merch margins, is it possible to talk a little more about the impact of these two individually going forward as well as the impact of mix?\nJamere Jackson: Yes. So, if you think about LIFO, we\u2019ve got about $57 million or so that we still need to get back through the P&L before we sort of wrap up that piece of our discussions, hopefully. We expect this quarter to be in the 5 to -- call it, 5 to 10-ish ZIP code, depending on what we see in terms of deflation. And the cadence going forward is likely going to be in that ZIP code. If it changes, as we\u2019ve done in the last few quarters or so, we\u2019ll give you our latest update and our latest guidance. And if you think about what we\u2019re doing from a gross margin standpoint, again, if you look at our business over the long term, we typically have driven gross margin improvement from a merchandising standpoint in that, call it, 30 to 35 bps range. And what we said after we came out of the pricing changes that we made a couple of years or so ago that we would continue to run that play with discipline and intensity and be able to drive that. From a supply chain standpoint, again, we are improving in supply chain, but it is largely because our supply chain was under tremendous pressure for a couple of years or so. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that portion to be 40 bps every single quarter, but we\u2019re making steady improvements there. And last quarter, in particular, was a tough quarter from a supply chain standpoint, and our teams have done a great job of turning that around.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Can you hear me now?\nBill Rhodes: Yes, we can.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Sorry about that. I guess the AirPods don\u2019t work. I wanted to ask about gross margin and get your temperature on this that the input cost environment is somewhat unique, forward pricing is coming in a little bit, freight costs are coming down. Is it a unique moment? You mentioned you\u2019re not going to -- you don\u2019t see a need to reinvest in price. What happens to any excess because this industry has pretty good pricing power, do prices come down or is that potential benefit to the gross margin?\nJamere Jackson: Well, I think what we\u2019ve said historically, and you\u2019ve seen us certainly behave this way is that as we saw inflation in the business, we took pricing accordingly. And as we come out of that, particularly with things like freight starting to come down, that is an opportunity for us to improve the gross margin profile of the business. The pricing environment has been incredibly rational, has been for decades, and it\u2019s certainly behaving rationally today. And so, we don\u2019t see a need to go deliberately invest gross margin improvements and the pricing to drive demand. But if the case was that we thought that the pricing bands which we\u2019ve established that have helped us grow our market share sort of got out of line, then we would not hesitate to go invest gross margin and be able to go do that to drive units and to drive market share growth. But the environment that we\u2019re operating in today is very, very rational, and we believe that the gross margin improvements that we\u2019re seeing today are an opportunity for us to expand margins and ultimately add more calories to the bottom line.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And then, my follow-up, just on the health of the business. In any way do you think that the DIY softness is a lead or could preclude the progress that you\u2019d like to make on commercial? I heard Bill Rhodes comment regarding it could take a little bit longer, but how do you think about the connectivity of both of these businesses?\nBill Rhodes: I think I\u2019ll go back to what I said, Simeon. I think we understand the retail business very well. As we\u2019ve ramped so significantly in the commercial business, I don\u2019t think we know what the cyclical nature of that business is. We have, as I said, a supposition that there are certain people that in difficult recessionary periods of time will trade down into DIY to do a brake job or a battery job where they might have taken it to a shop before. But remember, the last time we saw a real recession, our commercial business was $1 billion. We should surpass $5 billion this year. So, I just don\u2019t think we have the deep insights that we do in the retail business.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc.\nDaniel Imbro: I want to start on the domestic DIFM growth. I guess, you mentioned, Jamere, in your comments, the recent openings are creating an optical headwind just with more immature programs. What is the expected maturity curve or normal maturity curve for a new commercial program? And is it different in a new build versus when you\u2019re retrofitting and adding commercial to an existing store?\nPhil Daniele: That\u2019s a great question. Yes, it\u2019s not necessarily different between a net new store and one that\u2019s -- a store that\u2019s been open for some number of years and then you add the program later. But those maturity curves, as you would probably imagine, they ramp pretty quick on the very front end, and then it has a hockey stick over those first couple of years, and then they tend to grow consistently after that. Keep in mind, and I\u2019ll go back to one of the things we said earlier, we think an individual store should grow for a pretty long period of time based on the fact that we continue to improve execution and oh, by the way, we only have 4% to 5% market share. And that market share, although it may be slightly different depending on the size of the city or the market that we\u2019re competing in, we\u2019re still at a pretty low share, specifically relative to the WD space who owns the vast majority of that share.\nBill Rhodes: I think I\u2019d just add also, you can\u2019t think about these new stores as if they\u2019re in isolation. Many of those customers were servicing already from another store and will take 40% of the projected volume from another store because we can service them so much better because we\u2019re in a much closer proximity. So, every one of them is a little bit different. If they\u2019re in a rural area, we really don\u2019t service those customers, so they start from the ground zero. But many of the urban and suburban markets, we have a little bit of a head start already.\nPhil Daniele: So net opportunity to help service them better, therefore, you get more share of wallet.\nDaniel Imbro: Understood. Helpful color. And then my follow-up, just a question on the private label. How is the Duralast penetration trended in recent quarters? If I\u2019m remembering right, you invested a lot in parts quality in the last couple of years. I would think as the consumer becomes more price sensitive or just earning the value of private label should go up? So I\u2019m curious how that penetration is trending? And are we seeing that trade into that either on the DIFM or the DIY side?\nPhil Daniele: Yes. Keep in mind, so the Duralast investment in product quality and brand perception has been going on for decades, frankly. But I think we really accelerated that probably 10 years ago, maybe a little more. As we think about our family of brands, Duralast has essentially a couple of tiers, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Platinum, and we have some other private labels. But for the most part, we are -- generally speaking, we go for coverage first over choice. So, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of good, better, best up and down. We do in some categories like batteries and brakes and things of that nature. But for the most part, we may have a Duralast brand, and that\u2019s what we have. In some cases, we have a total pro brand, which would be an opening price point. But we don\u2019t have a whole lot of choice in our stores. We\u2019re generally speaking, coverage first, except in key categories, brakes, batteries being the best example.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: Just wanted to follow-up on the DIY business. Weather aside, it seems like you expect the DIY business to not only remain resilient but also potentially improve a little bit, if you\u2019re anticipating a slight decline in transactions and low- to mid-single-digit to ticket growth. Is that an accurate read?\nBill Rhodes: I think that\u2019s absolutely accurate, Seth. As we\u2019ve said for many years, the quote unquote, I\u2019ve said the dirty little secret about the retail side of this business is that the transactions have been challenged, and they\u2019ve been challenged for over 25 years. They\u2019re challenged for a lot of reasons because the OE manufacturers are making vehicles and their components much better. Used to, you\u2019d had a lot more frequency of failures on those components. Today, they\u2019re not. They don\u2019t fail as much because they have a lot of technology involved in those components. So, what has happened over a very long periods of time is you have this 2% to 4% drag on transactions, but you have an equivalent amount on the average price per piece because the cost of the technology that\u2019s going into those parts. We didn\u2019t see -- we eliminated that transaction drag during the pandemic and, frankly, grew upper single digits in transactions. Today, our transaction count is starting to look a lot more similar to the way it has been in the past. One of the challenges that we\u2019re still dealing with in the retail business is, last year, we had hyperinflation, double-digit inflation. And so, our ticket isn\u2019t up as much as it normally would be. And I think that\u2019s because we\u2019re normalizing getting past that super high inflation from last year. As we think about the DIY business thinking out 3 or 4 or 5 years, first of all, we\u2019re going to have to continue to improve it, and we have efforts underway to do that. But we believe it\u2019s a 3% kind of ticket drag and hopefully more than -- or sorry, transaction drag on a same-store basis and more than offset that from the average unit retail.\nSeth Basham: That\u2019s helpful. And just thinking about calendar 2024, if you look at the growth rate expectations for DIY versus DIFM on an industry basis, which one would you expect to accelerate more from \u201823?\nBill Rhodes: I think everybody thinks that DIFM is going to grow at these very rapid rates and DIY is going to decline. What we\u2019ve seen over a very significant periods of time is DIY usually grows 3% to 4%, and commercial grows 0.5 point to 1 point faster. I think if you rolled out the next three years, unless there\u2019s some big economic shock or something like COVID, that will probably continue to be the case.\nPhil Daniele: Seems appropriate, Seth that you got to ask Bill the last question that he probably gets to answer on these calls. So, before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand that our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season, and thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rhodes",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 first quarter conference call. With me today are Phil Daniele, CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin this morning, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their contributions during the quarter that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states, we lead with putting customers first, which allowed us to grow our total sales by 5.1% while both are operating profit and earnings per share, grew by very impressive high-teens rates. As we have previously said, we have been able to continually build on the phenomenal performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023. Our leadership team and I continue to be impressed with our post-pandemic sales performance. To put this in perspective, our FY 2019 sales were $11.6 billion and now our trailing four quarter sales are $17.7 billion, a 50% plus increase over a four-year time horizon. Congratulations AutoZoners everywhere who made that enormous success possible. For the first quarter, our total company same-store sales were 3.4% and 2.1% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story and an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, last quarter we began disclosing our global sales comp. We encourage you to focus on the constant currency number where international again had a strong quarter of 10.9%. Both our Mexican and Brazilian same-store sales had double-digit growth. We are very excited about the short- and long-term growth prospects of international. Our expectations are we will continue to grow both mature store volumes both in DIY and DIFM and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years, ultimately getting to a minimum of 200 international new stores by 2028. Next, our domestic same-store sales were up 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.7% last quarter and 5.6% in Q1 of last year. Our performance in retail was slightly below our expectations, but still, still resilient in the current environment. Breaking our sales into three, four-week segments, our DIY same-store sales were roughly 1% for both the first and last four-week segments, but were negative 2% in the middle four weeks or October. Commercial sales on the other hand accelerated for the quarter, but we started stronger than we finished. As you know some of the comparisons over the last few years were distorted. And on a three-year basis, the performance of each of the businesses this quarter was remarkably similar. Our commercial business grew 5.7% against exceptionally strong comps last year. Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the new initiatives we have in place to accelerate top-line growth in commercial, and those efforts are having a positive impact on our performance. And as we further analyzed our DIY and DIFM results and specifically our second period sales slowdown, our retail business was clearly impacted on a regional basis as we saw a 70 basis-point performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. We continue to attribute this gap in performance to the lack of winter weather last year and lack of snowfall. But enough about what happened to us. While not satisfied with our sales performance, we are encouraged as we enjoyed both, dollar and unit share gains in our domestic and retail businesses -- domestic retail and commercial businesses. We previously highlighted that we were not executing at peak levels, and we are encouraged to share that we are seeing steady progress. Our in-stock levels are nearing pre-pandemic levels. Turnover, while still elevated is beginning to decline. Productivity levels in our distribution centers have improved. The technology we deployed to improve service levels to commercial customers is seeing much higher adoption rates, leading to decreased delivery times and we have opened a significant number of new commercial programs, reaching 92% domestic penetration for the first time in our history. Even more encouraging is the continued strength in sales we are seeing from those new program openings as many are only weeks old. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil? Yes. I think I would also add, we continue to say that in Brazil, we're still losing money there. So we're in an investment phase. We're ramping up our store count very aggressively. But with that comes some operating losses that are kind of consistent with what we've been seeing over the last five or six years. I think that's right, Bret. But frankly, we have a lot of -- a whole lot of very new stores that are in very new markets as we're expanding. I mean, we've opened 40 stores or so in the last 18 months. And those stores are very immature. So, we've got to see how those new stores and new markets mature. Right now, they're causing a pretty good headwind but not unanticipated. That's a terrific question, Chris. Let's step back and talk about this on a long-term basis first. If you think about the retail business, which we have much more experience in the retail business and you think about it over long periods of time, we don't spend a lot of time talking about the strength of the consumer, much more so when tough times happen, i.e., recessions, those have been the periods where we've outperformed more so than any other periods of time. So, we don't spend a whole lot of time on the consumer. We certainly see in the retail business, there's some trading down going down the good, better, best product assortments. I think in the commercial side, we have suppositions that we haven't yet proven because we haven't been in that business at this level for an extended period of time. I believe we think that there may be some consumers that are trading from DIFM into DIY in certain jobs as they're trying to save money. The thing I would encourage us all to focus on more so than minor fluctuations in consumer sentiment. As we enter the second quarter, the one thing I always worry about is the weather patterns in the second quarter are extremely volatile, and they can have big impacts on our performance, both positive and negative. And as we've said, those impacts of the weather, particularly in the Rust Belt, can have ongoing implications as we get into the spring and summer and even the fall months. If we get significant snow and ice, particularly in the Rust Belt in the Northeast, that bodes well for us. If we don't, then we're going to have a little bit of a challenge. To me, that is the more impactful thing that's going to happen in the near term than consumer sentiment. Yes. It's interesting, Chris, because the beginning of the quarter last year, there was no weather. We had significant weather around the holidays for a couple of weeks and thought, okay, here we go on, our business responded really, really well. And then the January, February, into March, particularly in the Rust Belt, it was lack of snow and ice and fairly moderate temperatures. Unfortunately, we don't have a meteorologist on staff either. And at the end of the day, we're running this business for not quarters, not years, but for decades. And the weather implications, they're going to even out. I just always try to make sure and caution everybody at the beginning of the second quarter that we could have really strong performance and we can have really weak performances driven by weather, and that doesn't need to change how we approach our strategy over the long term. Yes. I'll separate the two. First of all, we've been in the retail business for a very long time. We've had lots of periods of time where we grow in the 0% to 2% kind of range. We're coming off a period of time in the pandemic where our retail volumes went up 25% to 30%. And we are, frankly, tickled to death to still be holding on to those retail volumes, and we believe we've retained about 85% of the share that we gained during that three-year period of time. So we're very pleased with that. We always want to grow faster. We're basically flat this quarter. We're trying new things, but we're pleased with where we are in the retail business. We aren't pleased with where we are in the commercial business. But let's don't forget, this quarter's comp of 5.7% is comping against about a 15% comp last year. So while we didn't meet our goals or aspirations in the quarter, 5% or 2%, we're not disappointed. We're not discouraged. We know we have a long runway to go in the commercial business. Again, we're going to play this in decades, not quarters and years. We feel like that depending on the weather in the second quarter, it's probably going to look similar to plus or minus 1% or 2%, similar to what we've seen in the first quarter. Our hope and our plan is to accelerate, particularly on the commercial side of the business as we enter the second half of the year and we continue to improve our execution. Yes, we can. I think I'll go back to what I said, Simeon. I think we understand the retail business very well. As we've ramped so significantly in the commercial business, I don't think we know what the cyclical nature of that business is. We have, as I said, a supposition that there are certain people that in difficult recessionary periods of time will trade down into DIY to do a brake job or a battery job where they might have taken it to a shop before. But remember, the last time we saw a real recession, our commercial business was $1 billion. We should surpass $5 billion this year. So, I just don't think we have the deep insights that we do in the retail business. I think I'd just add also, you can't think about these new stores as if they're in isolation. Many of those customers were servicing already from another store and will take 40% of the projected volume from another store because we can service them so much better because we're in a much closer proximity. So, every one of them is a little bit different. If they're in a rural area, we really don't service those customers, so they start from the ground zero. But many of the urban and suburban markets, we have a little bit of a head start already. I think that's absolutely accurate, Seth. As we've said for many years, the quote unquote, I've said the dirty little secret about the retail side of this business is that the transactions have been challenged, and they've been challenged for over 25 years. They're challenged for a lot of reasons because the OE manufacturers are making vehicles and their components much better. Used to, you'd had a lot more frequency of failures on those components. Today, they're not. They don't fail as much because they have a lot of technology involved in those components. So, what has happened over a very long periods of time is you have this 2% to 4% drag on transactions, but you have an equivalent amount on the average price per piece because the cost of the technology that's going into those parts. We didn't see -- we eliminated that transaction drag during the pandemic and, frankly, grew upper single digits in transactions. Today, our transaction count is starting to look a lot more similar to the way it has been in the past. One of the challenges that we're still dealing with in the retail business is, last year, we had hyperinflation, double-digit inflation. And so, our ticket isn't up as much as it normally would be. And I think that's because we're normalizing getting past that super high inflation from last year.

But we believe it's a 3% kind of ticket drag and hopefully more than -- or sorry, transaction drag on a same-store basis and more than offset that from the average unit retail. I think everybody thinks that DIFM is going to grow at these very rapid rates and DIY is going to decline. What we've seen over a very significant periods of time is DIY usually grows 3% to 4%, and commercial grows 0.5 point to 1 point faster. I think if you rolled out the next three years, unless there's some big economic shock or something like COVID, that will probably continue to be the case."

            "content": "Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As both Bill and Phil have previously discussed, we had a solid first quarter stacked on top of an impressive first quarter last year with 5.1% total company sales growth, 1.2% domestic comp growth, 10.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 17.4% increase in EBIT, and an 18.6% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have continued to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 5.1%, and let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, our domestic DIFM sales increased 5.7% to $1.1 billion and were up 20.6% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $15,900, down 0.6%. It's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was again impacted by a large number of immature programs that have opened over the last five quarters. While these openings depress the point in time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. We have intentionally opened more stores with commercial programs in response to the tremendous opportunity we see to grow our market share. We now have a commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 121 net new programs, finishing with 5,803 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we continue to have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 100 mega hub locations with 2 new mega hubs open in Q1. The 100 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of commercial programs and grew more than 2 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q1. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continued to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 mega hubs at full build out. These are difficult to find boxes in the right locations, but we are keenly focused on rapid expansion and have 45 currently in the pipeline and growing. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was essentially flat for the quarter. As mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.6%, offset by 1.5% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q1, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the balance of FY24. I'll now say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same-store sales grew 25.1% on an actual basis and 10.9% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 5 stores in Mexico to finish with 745 stores and 4 stores in Brazil ending with 104. We remain committed to international and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.8%, up 279 basis points, driven primarily by a noncash $81 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $2 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 70 basis-point improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter's 37 basis-point improvement. We've had exceptional gross margin improvement and in fact, we're at the highest gross margin rate we've had since FY 2021. I will point out that we now have $57 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $5 million in LIFO credits for Q2 based on the deflation experienced in Q1. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $57 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 68 basis points. The increase in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $849 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year favorable comparison. Interest expense for the quarter was $91.4 million, up 58% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $6.3 billion at Q1 end last year. We're planning interest expense in the $98 million range for the second quarter of FY24 versus $65.6 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.6% and up from last year's first quarter of 18.9%. This quarter's rate benefited 147 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 446 basis points. For the second quarter of FY24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, up 10% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.2 million was 7.2% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.55, up 18.6% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the first quarter, we generated $600 million in free cash flow. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q1 at 2.5 times EBITDAR, returning to our long-term target. Our inventory per store was up 0.3% versus last year while total inventory increased 3%, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $197,000 versus negative $249,000 last year, and negative $201,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 124.4% versus last year's 131%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1.5 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $300 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 3% of the shares outstanding in the quarter. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is reaccelerating. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil. Yes. I mean from a margin standpoint, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on margins, both gross margins and total operating margins. In our business in Mexico, which is much more mature than obviously what we have in Brazil, we've been very pleased with the actions we've been able to take on the merchandising side of the business, and that's given us a very healthy gross margin in that business. And then, if you also think about the inherent advantages that you have from a cost structure standpoint, particularly with wage rates and labor, it's a very attractive operating margin structure in Mexico. And we believe as our business in Brazil matures and scales over time that we'll see similar advantages in Brazil. So net-net, what we're doing on the international side, while it's a fast-growing business, it's also going to have a lot of margin calories that come along with it. Yes. We're pleased with the progress that we've made on gross margins, and it's really comprised of two pieces. Number one, from a merchandising margin standpoint, we've done a great job inside our merchandising organization of finding cost opportunities and pricing opportunities that have given us accretive gross margins, and we're doing a tremendous job there. Second element of that, quite frankly, has been the work that we've done inside the supply chain. If you recall, our supply chain was under tremendous pressure over the last couple of years or so from a cost standpoint, and we're now starting to see some benefits as some of those pressures have abated. But if you look at this business over the long term, I mean, we have historically been able to churn out positive gross margin improvements in a very-disciplined fashion over time. And that has enabled us to grow our earnings very predictably as we move forward. And when we think about the pricing environment, as we've said and we continue to reiterate, pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. We don't feel like we need to make any pricing investments at this point to be able to operate the business and grow share. But if we do have to make those moves, we'll certainly do those, if it results in us improving units and ultimately growing EBIT. But at this point, we're in pretty good shape in terms of where we are from a pricing standpoint and feel that we're very competitive in the marketplace. We like the investment profile that we have today. And we have been very, very clear that we're investing in SG&A at a pretty accelerated pace and have done so over the last couple of years or so, and that's come in the form of store payroll, particularly around our commercial program, but also IT. And these are the kinds of things that are enabling us to drive the growth initiative in commercial. For example, Phil mentioned what we're doing on delivery times. The work that we're doing to improve our delivery times is all underpinned by investments that we've made in technology that make it easier for us to deploy drivers and, quite frankly, give us a better opportunity to tell our customers exactly where our drivers are in the route and how fast they're going to get the parts. So, those are some of the examples of things that we've invested in, and we're going to continue to do that. And that investment profile is going to pay dividends for us, in terms of speed, in terms of productivity and in terms of better results, in terms of customer service. Yes. So, if you think about LIFO, we've got about $57 million or so that we still need to get back through the P&L before we sort of wrap up that piece of our discussions, hopefully. We expect this quarter to be in the 5 to -- call it, 5 to 10-ish ZIP code, depending on what we see in terms of deflation. And the cadence going forward is likely going to be in that ZIP code. If it changes, as we've done in the last few quarters or so, we'll give you our latest update and our latest guidance. And if you think about what we're doing from a gross margin standpoint, again, if you look at our business over the long term, we typically have driven gross margin improvement from a merchandising standpoint in that, call it, 30 to 35 bps range. And what we said after we came out of the pricing changes that we made a couple of years or so ago that we would continue to run that play with discipline and intensity and be able to drive that. From a supply chain standpoint, again, we are improving in supply chain, but it is largely because our supply chain was under tremendous pressure for a couple of years or so. So I wouldn't expect that portion to be 40 bps every single quarter, but we're making steady improvements there. And last quarter, in particular, was a tough quarter from a supply chain standpoint, and our teams have done a great job of turning that around. Well, I think what we've said historically, and you've seen us certainly behave this way is that as we saw inflation in the business, we took pricing accordingly. And as we come out of that, particularly with things like freight starting to come down, that is an opportunity for us to improve the gross margin profile of the business. The pricing environment has been incredibly rational, has been for decades, and it's certainly behaving rationally today. And so, we don't see a need to go deliberately invest gross margin improvements and the pricing to drive demand. But if the case was that we thought that the pricing bands which we've established that have helped us grow our market share sort of got out of line, then we would not hesitate to go invest gross margin and be able to go do that to drive units and to drive market share growth. But the environment that we're operating in today is very, very rational, and we believe that the gross margin improvements that we're seeing today are an opportunity for us to expand margins and ultimately add more calories to the bottom line."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Our domestic same store sales were 1.2% this quarter on top of last year's 5.6% growth. While we were up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress with more room for improvement. I want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago that we've made many changes across the organization from reinstituting many of our long-term processes to placing share of voice in vitally important areas, ensuring we are hiring the right AutoZoners, and execution is improving meaningfully. Our domestic commercial business grew 5.7%. We still have work to do, but we were pleased with the improvements we saw in this business. As the business began improving, we believe we grew share and set another record for the quarter with $1.1 billion in commercial sales. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales for quarter one. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years: improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, adding new hubs and mega hubs, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technological enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently, with improvements in delivery times and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q1, we opened 121 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them in the back half of the quarter. 69 of those 121 programs opened in weeks 7 through 12 of the quarter. While programs that opened late in the quarter have minimal sales impact on the quarter, they do position us for sales growth for the remainder of FY24 and beyond. As Bill previously shared, I want to reiterate, we now have commercial in approximately 92% of our domestic stores. When I was SVP of Commercial, we didn't have line of sight to reaching that level of penetration. It really is a great sign of the progress that we've made over the last five years or so. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rate should improve as we move through the year as comps get easier and our execution will continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had flat comps this quarter on top of last year's comp of 2.6%. While the data we have available to us indicates we continue to gain share in both dollars and units, our comp is below our expectations, but in line with what we are seeing across the industry. Regarding weather, it was quite mild this quarter. It is this time of year when our sales will fade as the summer sales slow down into winter. This year, October was warmer than last year, and sales in weather sensitive hard part categories in the Midwest and the Northeast underperformed the remainder of the country. While our retail comp was flat for the quarter, we saw the first four weeks comp up 1%, the second four weeks comp down 2%, and the last four weeks comp up 0.7%. While our performance clearly improved over the last four weeks of the quarter, we fell short of our own expectations for retail for the full quarter. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives part failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 1.6%, while our ticket was up similarly. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 3% to 4% range as we get further removed from the large increases from last year due to significant inflation, particularly due to freight costs. Regarding our commercial trends, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 230 basis-point worse performance between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As the Northeast and the Midwest experienced a very mild winter last year with below average snowfall, we sold less weather-sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Heading into the second quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern. But as a reminder, the Q2 is always our most volatile quarter as weather fluctuations can be extreme, meaningfully impacting our short-term sales performance, either positively or negatively. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback from customers. We do feel the low-end consumer started pulling back on discretionary purchases. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw low-single-digit inflation and as a result our ticket was up roughly 1.5%. We believe inflation for the second quarter will be similar as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels, lapping very high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very-disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost, and we believe we have entered into one of those periods. For the second quarter, we expect our DIY sales to remain more difficult and our commercial sales trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our other key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability: one is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts, and secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our distribution network. Along with having two domestic distribution centers currently under construction, our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive growth with speed and expanded availability and efficiency. Additionally, we plan to continue to grow internationally. At 840 store -- 849 stores opened internationally, or 12% of our total store base, these businesses had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Thank you, Jamere. During the quarter, we launched our new fiscal year, and I'd like to take a moment to discuss the key takeaways from our national sales meeting in September. At the meeting, we launched our operating theme for the New Year, Live the Pledge. While we have used this theme previously, it continues to deeply resonate with our AutoZoners. Simply put, it differentiates us from everyone else. The energy at the event has never been higher. The pledge is the core of our culture, and I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never overemphasize our culture. It is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It is based on a team-based approach of recognizing everyone's contributions and performance, putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. And it's about caring about people, both our customers and our AutoZoners. It's about providing unparalleled career opportunities to a diverse population of AutoZoners. And it's about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility, and it's so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategy succinctly. Fiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hubs and hubs. Construction on our new distribution centers and the optimization of our new direct import facility are a focus, as we are also ramping up our domestic and international store growth to achieve 500 annual new store openings by 2028. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now. While I mentioned all of these investments in FY24, the number one focus for the remainder of the year will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish for the remainder of this year. Finally, I'd like to update you on our leadership transition plan. Next month, Bill will become Executive Chair and I will become President and CEO. It will be one of the greatest honors of my life to move into that role. And while that role will come with new opportunities and challenges, I continue to be very bullish about the prospects because I know we have an extraordinary culture and a terrific industry and as you have seen, an ever-evolving but exceptional team. As Bill and I both continue to say, and it may sound a little bit cliche\u0301, and we both believe it. AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us. I want to thank Bill for his wonderful nearly 19-year tenure leading this company and thank him for his leadership. I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to leverage him and his experiences in this new role as Executive Chair. I also want to thank three other long-term senior leaders for their amazing contributions to our success Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel with their respective 34, 27, and 10 years of service to AutoZone. They have had an enormous contributions, and their legacies will be evident in the teams they have built and the contributions those teams will make over the coming decades. I congratulate each of them and wish Grant and Bonnie, Charlie and Doris, and Al and Sue well earned happiness in their next chapters. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Yes, there is. If you kind of looked at the business, and talking about the big traditional nationals and the up and down the street or the local shop, those folks have performed pretty well. The national accounts, particularly the ones that are focused on tires, have been where we've struggled the most. And this really goes back to a lot of the weather conversations we had from last year, those tire organizations just aren't getting the tires off at the same rate. They take the tire off, they see the calipers frozen or lots of rust on those parts in there and they get the job. That's just not happening at the same rate it has previously. Yes. Thanks. It's great question. I think as we said, we're slightly disappointed with our commercial growth for this particular quarter. We're happy to accelerate it, but we frankly thought it would accelerate a little bit faster. We're happy with the progress that we're making. And to your question about double-digit long term, yes, we think we can get back to those types of growth numbers over time, particularly because we have such low share percent on the commercial side of the business in that 4% to 5% range. So over a long time, we believe we will be able to continue to expand our market share. And as we continue to have these newer stores that we've opened over the last five quarters continue to mature and we continue to improve our execution, we believe we will continue to grow our comps in the DIFM space. Yes. I'll break that up into two parts. If you think about the DIY competition, we've had a very stable base of competitors there for a very long period of time. That business is pretty stable, and there's not a whole lot of new or changing strategies that appears from the competition. On the DIFM side, if you kind of think about our -- what we call our close-in competitors or the public folks, not a lot of changes there other than what O'Reilly did 1.5-year ago or so on their pricing strategy. On the WD side, I think you kind of have to look at pandemic time versus today, one of the things that we believe is they really struggled with some in-stock in some key categories over the pandemic. Over the last, say, a year or so, it appears that they have become more in-stock on those key categories, like everybody has, but they were probably more acutely impacted than a lot of the public players, and they've returned to more normal levels. As a reminder, we are still not back to our pre-pandemic levels of in-stock, but we're pretty darn close. Yes. Yes, just delivery times can be wildly different depending on proximity of the part and how close that shop may be to a given store or a hub or mega hub. And the delivery times on mega hub inventory or what we call expanded parts can differ wildly if it has to be relayed through a store or delivered directly. Our average delivery times, you're kind of thinking in that 30-minute range. So, a 10% improvement in delivery times is pretty meaningful, but it may be 3 to 5 minutes, and that matters when a customer is sitting there trying to turn their bay. So we believe we'll continue to leverage and improve our delivery times. And that's a key strategy for us because it's a measure of customer service. Yes. That's a great question. If you -- and I even mentioned it in the prepared remarks, if we go back to when I was SVP of Commercial, the facts are, our per store performance has improved on a per store basis, the productivity of those individual stores. Looking back over a decade's worth of time, we went through this phase where we had less than 50% of our stores or around 50% of our stores had commercial. And we slowly -- not slowly, we ramped up to roughly 70 -- high-70s, low-80% of our stores in commercial. Then, we had a period of time where we really focused on per store productivity. And that's been going on for the last several years, say, 5 to 7 years. Today, we're at a spot where we've had stores that previously didn't have commercial in them, and we've looked at the market differently with a much different share ownership, where we believe those stores are now productive and we're opening them. If you kind of forecasted that out into the future, we think we've probably opened the vast majority of those stores that previously didn't have commercial. There'll probably be some, but I don't think you'll see this large opening of previously opened stores that didn't have commercial programs that do today. But we think those stores over time will be as productive as the stores we have that have been open for a long period of time, and we like that productivity model going into the future. You also -- you mentioned price, specifically on the DIFM side. And although we made a price investment several years ago, today, we like our pricing strategy. Now, the pricing is always a pretty dynamic point of our business, and we'll continue to monitor that. But we like where we are from a pricing strategy today. So we don't see any major or deviation from our current pricing strategy. That's a great question. Yes, it's not necessarily different between a net new store and one that's -- a store that's been open for some number of years and then you add the program later. But those maturity curves, as you would probably imagine, they ramp pretty quick on the very front end, and then it has a hockey stick over those first couple of years, and then they tend to grow consistently after that. Keep in mind, and I'll go back to one of the things we said earlier, we think an individual store should grow for a pretty long period of time based on the fact that we continue to improve execution and oh, by the way, we only have 4% to 5% market share. And that market share, although it may be slightly different depending on the size of the city or the market that we're competing in, we're still at a pretty low share, specifically relative to the WD space who owns the vast majority of that share. So net opportunity to help service them better, therefore, you get more share of wallet. Yes. Keep in mind, so the Duralast investment in product quality and brand perception has been going on for decades, frankly. But I think we really accelerated that probably 10 years ago, maybe a little more. As we think about our family of brands, Duralast has essentially a couple of tiers, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Platinum, and we have some other private labels. But for the most part, we are -- generally speaking, we go for coverage first over choice. So, we don't have a whole lot of good, better, best up and down. We do in some categories like batteries and brakes and things of that nature. But for the most part, we may have a Duralast brand, and that's what we have. In some cases, we have a total pro brand, which would be an opening price point. But we don't have a whole lot of choice in our stores. We're generally speaking, coverage first, except in key categories, brakes, batteries being the best example. Seems appropriate, Seth that you got to ask Bill the last question that he probably gets to answer on these calls. So, before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand that our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season, and thank you for participating in today's call."
