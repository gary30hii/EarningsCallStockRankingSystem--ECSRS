        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the DICK'S Sporting Goods Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Executive Chairman and Chief Merchandising Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.\n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. \n And finally, a couple of admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Our consolidated same-store sales calculation includes stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers. And second, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our first quarter 2021 earnings release before the market opens on May 26, 2021, with our subsequent earnings call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We've never had a quite year like 2020. We were challenged in numerous ways as were so many others. But as an organization, we not only survived, we thrived. The strength of our diverse category portfolio, technology capabilities and advanced omnichannel execution helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle. \n For the full year, we delivered record sales and earnings. Our consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%, which was on top of our 3.7% comp increase from the prior year. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.12 represented a 66% increase over last year. We developed innovative technology, including curbside pickup, that set the pace for the retail industry and helped drive full year eCommerce sales of over $2.8 billion, an increase of 100%. \n Most importantly, we care for each other and our communities every step of the way. As we reopened our stores, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes was our highest priority, and we established protocols and procedures to provide a safe shopping experience. Our frontline hourly associates and distribution center teammates went above and beyond in 2020, and we showed our appreciation through our premium pay program. In total, 2020, we invested approximately $175 million across incremental teammate compensation and safety costs. \n Additionally, last Friday, we partnered with Allegheny Health Network to host a COVID-19 vaccination clinic at our corporate headquarters. As a result of this partnership, approximately 6,000 community members were vaccinated, the largest single vaccination clinic in the state of Pennsylvania to date. We plan to host a number of these vaccination clinics in the future also. \n We also recognize that youth sports programs have been severely hampered by the pandemic, and low-income communities of color have been most impacted. To help get these kids back on the field, we donated $30 million this year to our Sports Matter Foundation to help serve these impacted communities. \n While the pandemic informed much of our ESG activity in 2020, we also increased our focus on caring for the planet. Among other actions, this past year, we committed to become the sports retail sector lead of the Beyond the Bag challenge, which aims to identify innovative solutions to replace today's single-use plastic retail bags in a way that is both sustainable and convenient for our customers. We also joined the Outdoor Association's \tClimate Action Corps and committed to publishing climate-related goals in 2021. \n Today, as Lauren and Lee talk about another strong quarter, I remain as committed and as excited about our business as I've ever been. Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business during this very difficult year. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our team. I am extremely proud of how our teammates managed through this challenging year. They came together to care for their communities, their families and each other. At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great, and I am so excited for our future and for what I know we will all accomplish together. \n Now on to our results. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered a record fourth quarter from both a sales and profitability perspective. Our Q4 consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3%, which was on top of our 5.3% comp increase in the same period of last year. Our strong comps were supported by significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as we continue to benefit from favorable shifts in consumer demand as well as strong execution from our team. \n From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores comped positively for a second straight quarter, increasing mid-single digits, and our eCommerce sales increased 57%, representing nearly 1/3 of our total business. Within eCommerce, we continue to see the strongest growth across in-store pickup and curbside, which increased nearly 250% compared to BOPIS sales in the prior year. These same-day services are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. In fact, during Q4, our stores enabled 90% of our total sales and fulfilled over 70% of our online sales, either through ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. \n During Q4, we again remain very disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 372 basis points. This merchandise margin expansion drove a significant improvement in gross margin, which on a non-GAAP basis increased 507 basis points. In total, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 represented an 84% increase over last year. \n It's clear that our strategies over the past several years are working and have helped us not only withstand the pandemic but thrive, setting us up for long-term success. As we enter 2021, our business has so much momentum, and we are pleased with the start to our year. Our focuses here will center around enhancing our existing strategies to accelerate our core and enable long-term growth. \n First, within merchandising. Our strategic partnerships with key brands have never been stronger, and we will continue to make big bets with important brand partners. At the same time, we will continue to elevate our vertical brands. As we've discussed on previous calls, our vertical brands have become a significant source of strength and growth. \n During 2020, our vertical brands eclipsed $1.3 billion in sales with comps outperforming the company average by over 400 basis points. Our DSG brand finished the year as our largest vertical brand, and CALIA was again our second-largest women's athletic apparel brand, only behind Nike. Furthermore, our vertical brands together represented the company's largest brand in golf, fitness, outdoor equipment and team sports. \n During 2021, we will invest in making our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in store and increased marketing while expanding into additional product categories. Later this month, we'll augment our men's apparel selection by launching VRST, our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male. VRST, which will only be available at DICK'S, will put us in a much stronger position to compete with similar offerings from premium apparel brands and specialty athletic apparel stores. \n Also in 2021, we will build on our momentum from 2020 and drive growth in important categories, including golf, athletic apparel, footwear and team sports, as well as in fitness, which saw significant gains throughout the pandemic. \n In 2020, our golf business across both DICK'S and Golf Galaxy was tremendous. As the country's largest golf retailer, we are very well positioned to capitalize on increased participation and other favorable trends. And in 2021, we will invest in TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience in our Golf Galaxy stores. We'll also enable online booking of lessons and club fittings, and we'll invest in talent to elevate our in-store service model. \n Additionally, in 2021, we plan to build on the strong results and momentum in our athletic apparel and footwear businesses. Our athletic apparel assortment for 2021 is on trend, and we're excited to continue the energy in this category beyond the pandemic. We will complete head-to-toe looks with a strong footwear assortment and presentation. As part of this, we'll convert over 100 additional stores to premium full-service footwear, taking this experience to over 60% of the DICK'S chain. We believe that these enhancements, along with strong consumer trends and improving allocations of the most in-demand styles, will drive continued positive results in our athletic apparel and footwear business. \n Lastly, we expect our team sports business to provide a nice tailwind during 2021, as kids get back out on the field following a year in which many seasons were canceled. Furthermore, we plan to reconceptualize our soccer business, an initiative we delayed last year because of COVID. We will follow the same playbook we used to attack the baseball category in 2019, centered around more premium product, enhanced store experiences and exceptional service. \n Beyond merchandising, in 2021, we'll focus on several key areas to enable the profitable growth of our business, including our omnichannel experience, data science and customer relationships. Within our omnichannel experience, we'll continue to lean on our stores as well as our eCommerce business to serve our customers whom we call athletes whenever, wherever and however they want. \n As Ed mentioned earlier, in 2020, our eCommerce sales increased 100%, partially driven by our curbside service that we launched in March and continuously improved throughout the year. Curbside pickup, along with fewer promotions and leverage of fixed costs, drove significant improvements in the profitability of our online channel in 2020. In 2021, we expect curbside to remain a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering as our athletes turn to the service for speed and convenience. \n In addition to curbside, we will continue to improve our online shopping experience. This includes leading with mobile, which for 2020 represented over 50% of our online sales. This also includes shortening the path to purchase and reducing delivery times as well as becoming a more consistent destination for our athletes' needs by offering a more integrated loyalty experience. Beyond online shopping through our game-changer technology, we will enhance our scorekeeping and live streaming offering for used sports with video-on-demand, all delivered through a premium subscription service. \n We will also continue building relationships with both new and existing athletes in our stores and online. In fact, a key to our omnichannel offering is our ScoreCard program, which in 2020 drove over 70% of total sales. In 2021, we will continue to use data science to leverage our extensive athlete database to drive more personalized one-to-one marketing to increase loyalty among the 8.5 million new athletes that we acquired in 2020, including more than 2.5 million new athletes added during Q4. \n Lastly, we are very excited to be opening our first experiential prototype store next week in Rochester, New York. This new DICK'S store called DICK'S House of Sport, will focus on service and community and allow us to innovate and deliver elevated experiences to our athletes, including an outdoor field to host sports events and promote product trial, a rock climbing wall and health and wellness spaces for in-store programming. It will serve as a test and learn center and will roll the most successful elements into our core DICK'S stores. \n As I look at our business, we are really in a great position. Our brick-and-mortar stores and our technology platforms are working seamlessly together to deliver an industry-leading omnichannel experience. We have world-class vertical brands, and our vendor relationships with key partners have never been stronger. We've become more athlete-centric, focusing on friendly, knowledgeable and available service. Importantly, we have a respected and loved brand and are aligned behind our common purpose to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams. \n In closing, we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and 2020 results and look forward to building on this success in 2021. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2020 results. Consolidated sales increased 9.5% to $9.58 billion, even though stores were closed to foot traffic during the spring, representing 16% of our store days closed on average for the year. Consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%. And within this, we delivered a 100% increase in eCommerce sales. And as a percent of total sales, our online business increased to 30% compared to 16% last year.\n Gross profit for the full year was $3.05 billion or 31.83% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, improved 249 basis points from last year. This improvement was driven by a merchandise margin rate expansion of 204 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 114 basis points, partially offset by shipping expenses resulting from meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth. Gross profit also included approximately $23 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $2.3 billion or 23.98% of net sales on a non-GAAP basis and leveraged 25 basis points from last year, primarily driven by the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $178 million compared to last year's non-GAAP results driven by $152 million of incremental COVID-related compensation, safety costs as well as a $30 million donation we made to the DICK'S Foundation to help jump-start youth sports programs struggling to come back from the pandemic. Apart from these items, increases in store payroll and operating expenses encouraged to support the increase in sales were offset by expense reductions, including advertising during our temporary store closures. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $733.3 million or 7.65% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $292.8 million or 262 basis points from the same period last year. In total, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.69 last year, a 66% year-over-year increase. \n Now moving to our Q4 results. Consolidated net sales increased 19.8% to approximately $3.13 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3% driven by a 20.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1% decrease in transactions. Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up mid-single digits, even though we were closed on Thanksgiving Day. Our eCommerce sales increased 57%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 32% compared to 25% last year. And lastly, we delivered significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear. \n Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or 33.67% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, improved 507 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by a merchandise margin rate expansion of 372 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 148 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions and lower clearance activity. \n In terms of shipping expense, we saw higher costs from shipped packages due to increased volume and industry-wide holiday surcharges. However, the higher average ticket, combined with higher penetration of in-store and curbside pickup, neutralized this impact from a basis point perspective. Specifically, for the fourth quarter, our curbside and in-store pickup sales increased nearly 250%. \n SG&A expenses were $761.2 million or 24.35% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $163 million or 142 basis points compared to last year. 27 basis points are attributable to the expense recognition associated with the change in value of our deferred comp plans, resulting from the increase in overall equity markets during the fourth quarter. This expense is fully offset in other income and has no net impact on earnings. The balance of the deleverage was primarily due to $47 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs as well as the $30 million donation made to the DICK'S Foundation, most of which was in Q4. These items were partially offset by leverage on other expenses from the significant sales increase. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $298.5 million or 9.55% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $149.9 million or 385 basis points from the same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32 last year, an 84% year-over-year increase. \n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $2.21. This included $7.2 million in noncash interest expense as well as 6.7 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement, but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, is both related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now moving on to our balance sheet. We're in a strong financial position, ending Q4 with nearly $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion (sic) [ $1.855 billion ] revolving credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels decreased 11% compared to the end of the same period last year. Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean, and we'll continue to chase product to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand category. \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $53 million, and we paid $27 million in quarterly dividends. \n Now let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings. Due to the uneven nature of 2020, we planned 2021 off of 2019 baseline and for the same reason believe it will be important to compare against both 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, given the continued uncertainty around when athlete activities will normalize in 2021 and what the new normal will be, we'll be guiding to a wider range of possible outcomes than we typically do. \n Let's start with the sales guidance followed by EBT dollars and rate and then onto EPS. For 2021, consolidated same-store sales are expected to be in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%, which at the midpoint represents a low-double-digit sales increase versus 2019. Our square footage versus 2019 is about the same. We have been pleased with our sales trends so far this year. And for the first quarter, we expect significant consolidated same-store sales and earnings growth as we anniversary the majority of our temporary store closures from last year. Beginning in Q2, our guidance assumes comps will decline in the range of high single digits to low double digits as we anniversary more than a 20% comp gain across those quarters in 2020. \n Non-GAAP EBT is expected to be in the range of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 36% versus 2019 and down 18% versus 2020. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to increase over 100 basis points versus 2019 and declined approximately 150 basis points versus 2020. Within this, gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019 driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins. When compared to 2020, gross margin is expected to decline due primarily to gradually normalizing promotions and modest deleverage on fixed expenses beginning in the second quarter. \n SG&A expense is expected to deleverage versus both 2019 and 2020. Compared to 2019, SG&A is expected to deleverage primarily due to hourly wage rate investments. Compared to 2020, SG&A is expected to deleverage primarily due to normalizing advertising expense as a percent of net sales. Our guidance also contemplates approximately $30 million of COVID-related safety costs during the first half of the year, the vast majority of which will fall within SG&A. \n In terms of our premium pay program for hourly in-store -- hourly store and DC teammates, at the beginning of fiscal 2021, we transitioned to more lasting compensation programs, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums. The impact of these programs has also been included within our guidance but falls outside of the aforementioned COVID costs as these changes are now permanent. \n Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.40 to $5.20, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 30% versus 2019 and down 22% versus 2020. Our earnings guidance is based on 96 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. This is lower than our traditional tax rate and is due to the favorable tax impact of share-based payments expected to vest in 2021. \n Our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditures of $275 million to $300 million, which will be concentrated in improvements within our existing stores, ongoing investments in technology as well as 6 new DICK'S stores, 6 new specialty concept stores, and we will also convert 2 Field & Stream stores into Public Lands stores and relocate 11 DICK'S stores. \n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 16% to $0.3625 per share or $1.45 on an annualized basis. In addition, our plan includes a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider continuing to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $200 million. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our 2020 results. We are looking forward to continuing this success in 2021, and we remain very enthusiastic about our business. \n Before concluding, I want to highlight a new investor presentation that will be posted to our Investor Relations website later today. The intent of this presentation is to serve as a resource to provide current and prospective investors an overview of our company, strategy and competitive differentiation. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. \n Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the outlook for 2021. I get that gross margin is expected to be up versus 2019 levels. Obviously, there's a very wide range of outcomes in there. Is there anything you can help us think through? Obviously, on a -- let's say, a midpoint of a 0 comp, you give back some of the -- maybe rent leverage, the occupancy that you got, so we can do that part. But as far as the remaining balance of product margins, some of the puts and takes there. \nLee Belitsky: The business -- the merchandise margin rates that we've obtained during the second through fourth quarter this year were largely attributable to fewer -- far fewer promotions than we've had. And we haven't thus far seen the need to add back promotions. But as we get into the year and we believe that the supply of merchandise will become more plentiful out there, that there's a potential that the industry will return to more normal promotional levels as we get through the year. It's hard to say exactly when that will happen or to what extent it will happen, but we're planning on the merchandise margins gradually adding back promotions, looking really at Q2 through Q4. \n We don't intend to lead the promotional charge there. It's not really our approach to this, but we will have to react if the marketplace goes there. Right now, inventories are in good shape but are light kind of across the industry and across categories right now. So we don't see anything imminent, but we're being cautious about kind of the back half of the year this year with respect to promotions. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. My second question, maybe bigger picture. Can you share -- are you giving thought to the long-term margin power of the business? And I don't know if you're planning to discuss that with investors in the next year or so. It looks like the business historically peaked at around a 9% EBIT margin, and that looks like pre-eCommerce days. And a lot of this looks like it is dependent on the gross margin. So I don't know if there's a time frame in which you could share, maybe providing an update to The Street on where you think the earnings power of the business is, if 2020's margin rate is the reasonable new level of ceiling to get back to over time. How should we think about that? \nLauren Hobart: We are not going to share our long-term guidance on what our operating margin will be going forward. However, we definitely view there is upside in the operating margin, and we plan to continue to deliver that over the next few years. We're just not laying down a commitment right now. \nLee Belitsky: I would just add to that, that I think we want to see how the business settles out once we get past kind of the pandemic-driven demand and how much of that demand we hold on to. We believe a lot of it\u2019s just new normal, and we'll come out of this at a meaningfully higher level of sales, but we'd like to see where that settles in. So we understand what the base is that we can build off of going forward. So we'll have more information on this probably later in the year this year. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And if I can just -- back to the gross margin for a second, I know there's not a lot of color, but if we get a little bit leverage actually on occupancy versus '19 and hunt is down, which should be a positive, better eComm margin should be -- could be 25, 50 basis points. It's possible like we could pencil out something 32 and change, but I don't know if you can comment on any of my math there, Lee. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. I'm not really prepared to comment on the math now, but we do believe that this will -- there continues to be opportunity on the gross margin side. \nOperator: The next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on a strong year all year long and ending on a high note. This is for Ed and/or Lauren. Can you talk about long-term store targets? And maybe on a 3 to 5-year basis, what your annual gross new store and net store growth should be, how we should think about that? \n Also for Ed and Lauren, can you talk about the team sports opportunity? If you can give us some characterization of how large that is as a percent of sales historically and what the relative merch margin of that business is. \n And finally, for Lee, the quarter-to-date comp and just any comments on delays, port congestion and how that's impacting the flow of product. \nLauren Hobart: Okay, Adrienne, thank you. So starting with the long-term store targets. I think one thing that has become very, very clear to us this year is that our stores are an enormous asset to us as part of our whole omnichannel ecosystem. And so we are -- we view our store growth and our eCommerce growth as very symbiotic and hand in hand, and so we will see us continuing to experiment with different types of store prototypes. We've got our new House of Sport that we mentioned, which is a larger prototype, and we will continue to be looking at where we would want to penetrate. That said, I would not expect a radical change in our store growth in the next few years. We laid out what we've got on plan for this year, and we'll continue to seize opportunities as they come up. \n Talking about team sports, frankly, we think there's a huge tailwind in team sports. There was a lot, obviously, of kids who did not get to play this past year. And while the season started a little slow year-to-date due to some cold weather and still COVID concerns, we fully believe -- football is sort of playing in many parts of the country now, and baseball is next. And we see team sports as a large and big tailwind, while people are still also buying golf and fitness and other outdoor activities that have become part of their new lifestyle. Lee, you want to take the port delays? \nLee Belitsky: So with regard to supply chain, we have seen some delays across some product categories that we have. Our inventories are a little bit lower than we would like them to be. We were a little bit constrained in the fourth quarter, not so much to do with port delays, but due to some categories of merchandise not being manufactured as highly as we would have liked. But we don't anticipate that being a significant impediment to our business at this point. \n Now that could change. It looks like the supply chain issues, I'd say, over the last couple of weeks, have got a little bit better. They have been trending worse for a while, but it seems like what we see Asia is catching up a little bit right now. The ports are getting a little bit better in the U.S., and we're in a pretty good inventory position at this point. So we don't really see that as an impediment to doing the business we need to do over the next couple of quarters. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Any comment on quarter-to-date? \nLee Belitsky: We're really pleased with our quarter-to-date sales, so we'll leave this at\u2026 \nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if you could comment at all about what you're seeing of the golf business in warmer weather regions and how it might be providing a readthrough to the spring and summer season for golf nationally. \n And then my second question was just around the store relocations. I think you mentioned that you're doing 11 this year. I think this is a little bit higher than what you traditionally do. I wondered if there were more real estate opportunities or new real estate opportunities in which you're relocating into, and is it at more favorable rates? \nLauren Hobart: Kate, I'll start with the golf business. We are incredibly bullish on the golf business. It has remained strong through the pandemic in the warm weather markets and still strong nationally across the board. So participation rates are up. There's new athletes in the golf sector, and we see a lot of growth ahead of us there. \n In terms of relocations, we definitely have multiple opportunities, and a big part of our strategy with real estate right now has been to either renegotiate or relocate. And we do see a nice pop when we do relocate into a new store from a sales and profit standpoint. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. The big driver on the relocations is more the lift in sales we get from it than the savings in rent. Sometimes, the rent is reduced. But typically, we get a fresh new store, and we see a significant sales and profitability lift as well. Our new stores continue to perform very well as well, so we're -- we've been selective in picking our targets for new stores, and the economics have been very good. So we're not discouraged from opening new stores in any way, but we do want to continue to be selective. \nOperator: The next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: One bigger picture question. Why do you think you're better positioned today than you were pre-pandemic? Is it vendor relationships? Is it eCommerce? Is it technology? Is it all of the above? I think one thing important to note that, even before the pandemic, in 2019, I think that was your best comp in 4 or 5 years. So clearly, things are moving in the right direction pre-pandemic. What do you think is leading to that better positioning? \nLauren Hobart: Mike, thank you for your question, and I couldn't agree more with you. This is not just a pandemic bump that we had this past year. We have been, many years now, working on a new strategy to develop our entire omnichannel ecosystem to make the most out of our stores, to make the most out of our online sales. And I would say that, that on top of amazingly strong vendor relationships, which have only gotten stronger through the pandemic, the ecosystem that we've created with curbside now making our stores really pinnacled part of our digital experience, our technology investments over the past few years helped us, not just grow and spin up curbside in 2 days once the pandemic hit, but also leveraged our fixed expenses in a way that we couldn't have if we hadn't invested in technology a few years ago. So I do feel like -- we've had our best quarters right before the pandemic, and then we had our best quarters during the pandemic, and we look forward to returning to a little bit of normalcy and working through our operating model. \nLee Belitsky: And just to add to Lauren's comments, from a consumer trends perspective and activities trend, we're excited about some of the new habits that our athletes have picked up during the year, whether it's golf or running or other outdoor activities that require footwear, athletic apparel and so on, in addition to some -- what's likely to be some more work from home, which should add more time to people's lifestyle. So we like the product trends going forward, and we think that demand is going to settle in at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic as well as a result of all these new activities that our athletes have got engaged with. \nLauren Hobart: Sorry, Mike, I just wanted to add one more thing, which is one of the most pleasing things to see over the past few quarters is that as we launched curbside and improved our digital and our eCommerce experience and then we opened up our stores, that our stores are comping positively, while we're still getting incredibly strong growth out of the eComm. So that feels like a long-lasting trend. \nMichael Baker: Yes. I was just going to add that I imagine you're selling a lot of layer-type Under Armour or the DSG similar product for winter football in New England. It's been cold out there for some of these [ practices ]. \nLauren Hobart: It's cold. Yes. There is a mini football season going on. Who knew there was going to be a football in February or March, but there is. And yes, we need some Under Armour or some cold gear -- DSG [ brand ]. \nOperator: Christopher Horvers, your line is open on our end, from JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about strong performance in hardline, apparel and footwear. Can you talk about sort of the relative performance and perhaps how that changed versus what you saw in the third quarter? And any comment on how stimulus impacted those trends? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Chris, so hardlines were incredibly strong in the fourth quarter, and that's similar categories to what was doing well in Q3. But fitness, golf, outdoor equipment, which is where our bikes, paddle sports, all that -- the hardlines were really quite a champion. Despite supply constraints and challenges that we had getting a lot of product, they really dominated this year, but footwear -- this quarter and the year. But footwear and apparel also were strong. \n Lee, I'll turn it over to you to -- stimulus, we don't have -- we actually -- we do not -- we cannot quantify how much stimulus checks helped us and may help us in the future. It's not something we're planning against. There's just so much noise in the business in terms of trying to measure what the exact impact of that is that we're -- yes. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then can you talk a little bit about working capital outlook, the balance sheet? Where is -- what's the right level from a days of inventory perspective? Should we look at 2019 as the right level? You ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash. You're baking in sort of a minimum $200 million share repurchase. Most of the difference between the EPS outlook versus The Street was really driven on that -- on the share count line. So is there something that you're holding on to that cash for? Is there a big working capital drain that you're expecting? And why wouldn't you buy back significantly more than $200 million? \nLee Belitsky: Well, a couple of things. I'll address a couple of questions. With regard to working capital, we are planning to end '21 with our inventory levels approximately even to 2019. So we expect the sales to be up about low double digits. I think the math comes out to like 11%, and we expect the inventory to be about the same at the end of '19. So while the inventory turn will probably be a little bit lower than it is in 2020, we expect it to be meaningfully higher than it was in 2019. The accounts payable leverage will be greater than 2019, will be less than 2020, but there's no unusual drain on working capital as expected. \n With regard to share buybacks, we've set it at a minimum of $200 million for this year. And we've also said that -- and that's what we baked into the forecast right now, but we'll also look at the pace of our business as we go forward and measure that, measure what's happening with the pandemic. And if there are any changes to demand resulting from that in our business, we leave open the possibility of buying back more shares that's appropriate for the business. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then one last question. Do you expect eCommerce growth to be up in '21? And to the extent that you expect it down, how might that impact your gross margin. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. So we're planning our eCommerce business to be down versus 2020. We just had a really unusual lift in the business, particularly in the back half of the first quarter and into the second quarter when the stores were closed. So we're going to come up against some really big eCommerce numbers. Certainly, our run rate in the eCommerce business coming out of Q4 is a lot higher than it was last year, so we're very optimistic about the eComm business. So that's good for us. \n The AURs have been good for us there. We're using ship from -- excuse me, we're using curbside, pickup and in-store pickup as well, which doesn't have a delivery cost. So the impact on our overall gross margins shouldn't be significant from the eComm business coming down as a percent of the mix modestly. \nOperator: The next question is from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Congrats on the quarter. I was hoping you could frame a little bit more the incremental costs in FY '20. I think Ed had talked about $175 million for the year. I don't think that included the $30 million donation. And also, I assume there was higher incentive comp and maybe some other factors. So Lee, maybe can you confirm that and help us think about how much was in the base for '20? \n And then for the outlook, I want to make sure we have this right. It sounds like you're saying don't necessarily assume that these costs come back because you're going to reallocate that to more permanent wages and things like that. Can you just confirm that as well? \nLee Belitsky: Yes. So a couple of points there, $175 million. We got $163 million of -- excuse me, $175 million of COVID costs do not include the $30 million of additional foundation contributions. So those are -- were incremental in 2020. However, the COVID costs, going forward, a large piece of that has been kind of reallocated into more permanent wage increases. We continue to see wage pressures in order to get the right kind of talent in our stores. We're continuing to have to invest more in our hourly wages to maintain those -- the right kind of people, both in our stores and our distribution centers. So a large part of that is being reinvested, as you said, going forward. \nLauren Hobart: The other piece I want to mention is that advertising expense this past year was pretty much nonexistent between March and May, while we were trying to figure out how we were going to manage liquidity through the pandemic. And so that is another cost that will be normalizing next year. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And then just another follow-up and clarification. Lauren, you talked about earlier upside to the long-term operating margins of this business. Just to confirm, is that versus the 5.1% in 2019 or versus what you just saw in 2020? \nLee Belitsky: I would say it's versus our guidance for this year. If you take the midpoint of our guidance, we think we can establish that as a new base and then keep building off of that. So it's over 6% operating margin we can build from there. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Schwartz: Mike Schwartz on for Michael Lasser. Looking back at the sales growth you saw over the past year, would you be able to parse out how much of that was driven by new customers versus increased spend from existing customers? And how do new customers compare to existing customers in terms of ticket and frequency? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Mike, we have had a significant increase in new customers over the course of this past year. We had 8.5 million new customers over the full year and 2.5 million in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with the makeup of the new customers. They tend to skew a little younger than our average former customer or current customer, a little bit slightly more female and slightly more urban. So we do think a lot of the exits from the cities are people engaged with the brand for the first time, and we're working very hard to keep those people in our database and encourage second purchases. But it's a huge -- it's a big piece of our growth. \nMichael Schwartz: And as a follow-up, is [ it within ] DICK\u2019s ability to drive a more limited promotional stance when we think about from 2019 levels? Or will it depend on pricing and promotional intensity in the marketplace? \nLauren Hobart: I couldn't hear the first part of your question, but I think you were asking is DICK'S able to lead a less promotional environment than 2019? Is that -- was that your question? \nMichael Schwartz: Sure. Just whether or not the company has levers to drive a more limited promotional stance on its own or if it's more of a market dynamic? \nLauren Hobart: We do not plan to be very promotional moving into. Of course, we will respond to any market pressure that we have or any environmental or economic pressure, but we do not plan to lead a hyperly promotional cycle here. And we believe we have the levers to manage appropriately through. \nOperator: Your next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Long time, Ed. Hope you're well. Just on the lease front, I know you have a number of leases coming up for renewal over the next several years. Just wondering how we should think about the impact from that to the occupancy cost line over the next couple of years. \nLee Belitsky: Well, we've got about 2/3 of the leases coming due over the next 5 years, and we have an option on those leases. As we go forward in the majority of those stores, as we negotiate new leases, we've been able to negotiate reductions along the way. It also gives us leverage to drive better deals when we relocate stores. So I would expect modest declines year-over-year in the rent line, going forward, as we have all along. \nCharles Grom: Got you. Great. And then just one quick question, and I apologize for being near-term-oriented, but I'm wondering if you're seeing any difference in regional performance where there's been fewer COVID restrictions, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, Texas, versus maybe, say, up here in the Northeast. \nLauren Hobart: I think the best way to answer that is just that, obviously, COVID restrictions have allowed different levels of activity. And team sports coming back and we are looking at the business that way and where they are coming back, we're seeing strength in those businesses. \nOperator: The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk about the mix performance and the impact it had on gross margin this year in F '20. And just how you think the mix could have an impact on that merch margin line in F '21? You maybe talk from a category perspective, also private-label perspective in terms of how you're managing that business. \n And then second, just also curious if you can comment on what's going on in the competitive landscape. Just how much of your F '21 guidance is driven by what you think will be market share opportunities from competitor store closings, either medium-sized chains, small-sized competitors? Any numbers you can share around that. \nLee Belitsky: Mix in 2021 should be a little bit favorable to 2020 because the strongest part of the business in 2020 was really in the hardlines categories, outdoor equipment, fitness and so on. And as we go forward, we expect to see a recovery in team sports. We can expect to see continued strength in athletic apparel, in the athletic footwear businesses, which are higher margin businesses. In addition to that, we expect to see our private brands -- our vertical brands continue to grow, which is also a positive from a mix perspective. And the hunt business coming down, which should be favorable from a margin perspective. So there are some basis points of mixed favorability I would expect to see in 2021. \n With regard to the competitive landscape, I don't see that much changing from a brick-and-mortar perspective. I think the sporting goods sector is generally in good shape right now. The pandemic has spurred sales across our sector, so I don't expect to see closures really in any kind of meaningful way this year. \n With regard to department stores, some of the department stores are closing some stores, which should be favorable. But on the other hand, some of them are going after kind of the athletic apparel space a little bit more aggressively, which will work the other way. So long and short of it, I don't really see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape this year in the brick-and-mortar space. \nOperator: The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Congrats on a phenomenal year. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you. \nJohn Kernan: Can you talk to inventory levels in -- the middle of 2020 were down pretty significantly. Were you supply-constrained in any key categories where you felt like you potentially left some comps on the table? I mean comps were obviously phenomenal. I'm just curious if there was demand you couldn't fulfill. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. John, there definitely was some demand we've been chasing all year in categories that were surging due to the pandemic and managing through it. So it's on a hand-to-mouth basis for some of these categories. We left some sales on the table, but let me turn it over to Lee. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. I mean the categories that we were chasing all year were fitness, kayaks and golf equipment and athletic apparel. So certainly, if we had more inventory over the course of the year in certain key categories, our sales would have been higher. We are in much better shape in inventory right now. So we're down 10%. We feel pretty good about our inventory levels right now. There's still a few pockets where we're short, but we don't have the kind of widespread inventory outages that we did through mid and the latter part of the year last year. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. And maybe my follow-up question goes back to the mix question. How will mix affect comps this year? I know ticket was a big driver of overall comps in fiscal '20. Just curious how you expect mix to affect, not only the gross margin but also the comps this year. \nLee Belitsky: Well, that remains to play out, I think, for us to take a look at it and see how well the big-ticket items hold up. Part of the reason the average retail is up so much because we were less promotional, so that drove a lot of the average ticket. But we did have strength in big-ticket items like in the fitness area, in kayaks, golf clubs and so on. And I think we feel really good about the golf business. We feel good about all of those categories right now. And time will tell as we get later in the year when the new activities kind of normalize, what will happen to the sales there. \nOperator: The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: It's Scot Ciccarelli. So it seems like your new men's athletic apparel brand, VRST, is aimed right in the middle of the core merchandise offering for some of your most important vendor partners. I'm just curious how you guys are planning to introduce that brand. And any potential conflicts that could create with those partners, especially given your comment on the improving vendor relationships? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Scot, so the VRST brand that we mentioned, our new men's premium athletic apparel brand, we believe is very much a white space in our stores right now. It's competing with other specialty, but we do believe, when you see it, it will be -- it's a very different product assortment from what we have with our core vendor partners right now, and it is a white space. You can think of it sort of as the CALIA version on the men's side in terms of filling a white space that we have, that our current partners are just not -- are not in. \nScot Ciccarelli: So can you provide any more detail on why that's going to be different than, say, a Nike, Under Armour type offering, Lauren? \nLee Belitsky: I would say it's closer to lululemon, and the assortments that they've got, it's more a\u2026 \nLauren Hobart: Lifestyle. \nLee Belitsky: It's lifestyle apparel that you can wear to work, you can travel in. There is -- you can work out in it if you choose to. So it covers a broader range of activities than kind of the Nike, which is a little bit more athlete focused than our new brand that\u2019s coming out. \nOperator: The next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. \nSteven Forbes: So given the comments, right, on the importance of the stores, I think Lee spoke to that 6-plus percent operating margin. Curious if you can remind us what the 4-wall margin profile is across the mature store base and/or what sort of 4-wall margin target you guys are looking at when you're identifying relocations, right, or new store opportunities. \nLee Belitsky: We really run on a return on investment, and we're -- and in our new stores, the hurdle that we're aiming for is at least an 18% IRR on the stores, including relocations have to be an IRR over, if we've remained in the existing store so in order to spur the new investment. And typically, we can do that because we get a large sales lift out of the stores when they move. \nSteven Forbes: And then just a follow-up, right, given that ROI focus. Any comments as we return to sort of these premium footwear decks on the IRR attached to that initiative? Or any color on what we should think about in terms of a sales lift? \nLauren Hobart: We're not going to share the IRR of the deck, other than to say that the decks have unlocked a lot of assortment and a much better athlete experience. And so it's really been a game changer, a very positive game changer for our entire footwear business. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory. \nJoseph Feldman: Wanted to ask -- you've mentioned last -- doing some things to enhance the mobile experience. If you could share a little more color on that and how you would be better integrating, I guess, that experience for the consumer. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We're working on a relaunch of our mobile app. That said, mobile is already 50% of our eCommerce sales. And the plans we have right now are to fully integrate both the store experience and the ScoreCard experience into the online shoppers' experience, and in particular, making the mobile app the hub of the ScoreCard users -- the ScoreCard members' entire DICK'S experience. More to come. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. And then the other kind of topic I wanted to ask about was sort of on the last mile. Obviously, you made great strides this past year. Where are you headed in '21? Like is it -- do you kind of go back and find ways to make curbside more efficient, BOPIS, things like that? And how do you do that, if you could share some plans for that? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We are focused on the last mile, and we are focused on trying to improve the BOPIS profitability. But also, the profitability is great in that channel, but the customer experience -- so we're working on things like speed to athletes. So right now, people are getting notified that their BOPIS curbside order is ready. We promise under an hour. It's a lot faster than that, usually within 30 minutes or faster. Curbside wait is -- it's just a couple of minutes, very quick. And so we're trying to just make the experience become so convenient that people love it. And the other thing we did this past year is tested Instacart for same-day delivery, and that's just a small test to see whether our athletes want same-day delivery, and we'll be looking into that as the year goes on. \nOperator: The next question is from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: Great quarter. I just had a follow-up question on Simeon's question and some of the other questions on gross margin. So if I just try to sort out what's happening to your gross margin structurally and filter out some of the noise of 2020 and even 2021, in a scenario where we're back to a post-COVID sales mix, post-COVID more normalized promotional environment, whenever that may be, can you maybe just rank order the biggest changes to your structural underlying gross margins relative to 2019 levels? \nLee Belitsky: I would say the largest one, we believe, will be the merchandise margin being higher due to mix shift and due to better promotions management, particularly online. I'd say that's the largest. I'd say the second largest is going to be around leverage of occupancy expense. To the extent we've got the same square footage in 2021 as we did in '19 and we're able to continue to drive some rent reductions along the way, we should be able to continue to leverage our occupancy expense. \n Going the other way, as eCommerce is a larger part of the business, there is some pressure from additional delivery expenses to get products to customers. We did a really good job in the fourth quarter, mitigating that through more BOPIS and curbside pickup and higher AURs. We think we'll be able to hold on to some of that, but it will be a constant, very detailed management effort on our expenses there to try to keep that down. But I would expect versus '19, the delivery expenses to run a little bit higher as a percent of sales from the eCommerce business. \nOperator: The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: My question's around SG&A. If you could contextualize the underlying growth in SG&A that we're seeing in the business. Maybe if you think about it on a 2-year basis from 2019, should we be looking at 3% to 4% growth on an annual basis underlying? \nLee Belitsky: So versus '19, the main drivers of growth are really our store payroll expenses, and that's really driven by higher wage rates that are across the board. I'm not going to comment on the exact amount that it's going up, but the deleverage that we are experiencing is really attributable to that factor, the hourly wage rates. Advertising is in good shape. Admin expenses are in good shape as well, so it's really driven by store payroll. \nSeth Basham: Okay. But no comment on what the underlying growth rate's been? \nLee Belitsky: I don't have a comment on that at this point. \nSeth Basham: Okay. And just as a follow-up, thinking about some of the smaller elements of SG&A. Looking at your D&A on the CapEx step-up and other SG&A that might follow with those increased capital investments, is that a headwind in 2021? \nLee Belitsky: Not really. Not really. As we know, we got investments coming in throughout the year this year, a partial year of depreciation expense. It's not really a headwind for this year. \nOperator: And the final question today will be from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo. \nTom Nikic: Lauren, I just want to ask quickly on the ScoreCard loyalty program. I think it launched something like 18 months ago, and it seems like you've gotten a pretty good uptake there, like I think 70% of sales. I just wanted to ask you, are there like meaningful differences in the metrics you're seeing of your ScoreCard members, non-ScoreCard members in terms of buying frequency or average basket or anything like that? And then just also, do you think that, that 70% penetration can move even higher from here? Is this the kind of situation where you could see it becoming 80%, 90% of sales? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Just to clarify one thing. Our ScoreCard program has been around for actually many, many years, and 70% penetration has been similar for the past few years. We always hope it's going to increase, but it's a very, very high number as it is. What I think you're referring to is our ScoreCard Gold Program, which we launched probably about 18 months ago now, which is for our best customers who do account for our highest level of sales, over $500 a year is what the criteria is, and they contribute an awful lot of our total sales, are -- higher on an AUR -- every transaction, every lever is higher. \nTom Nikic: Understood. Got it. And so you think 70% is kind of the sort of steady-state penetration for the loyalty program overall? \nLauren Hobart: It's a reasonable assumption. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lauren Hobart for any closing remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S, and a final thank you to our teammates for their amazing performance this year. Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We've never had a quite year like 2020. We were challenged in numerous ways as were so many others. But as an organization, we not only survived, we thrived. The strength of our diverse category portfolio, technology capabilities and advanced omnichannel execution helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle. \n For the full year, we delivered record sales and earnings. Our consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%, which was on top of our 3.7% comp increase from the prior year. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.12 represented a 66% increase over last year. We developed innovative technology, including curbside pickup, that set the pace for the retail industry and helped drive full year eCommerce sales of over $2.8 billion, an increase of 100%. \n Most importantly, we care for each other and our communities every step of the way. As we reopened our stores, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes was our highest priority, and we established protocols and procedures to provide a safe shopping experience. Our frontline hourly associates and distribution center teammates went above and beyond in 2020, and we showed our appreciation through our premium pay program. In total, 2020, we invested approximately $175 million across incremental teammate compensation and safety costs. \n Additionally, last Friday, we partnered with Allegheny Health Network to host a COVID-19 vaccination clinic at our corporate headquarters. As a result of this partnership, approximately 6,000 community members were vaccinated, the largest single vaccination clinic in the state of Pennsylvania to date. We plan to host a number of these vaccination clinics in the future also. \n We also recognize that youth sports programs have been severely hampered by the pandemic, and low-income communities of color have been most impacted. To help get these kids back on the field, we donated $30 million this year to our Sports Matter Foundation to help serve these impacted communities. \n While the pandemic informed much of our ESG activity in 2020, we also increased our focus on caring for the planet. Among other actions, this past year, we committed to become the sports retail sector lead of the Beyond the Bag challenge, which aims to identify innovative solutions to replace today's single-use plastic retail bags in a way that is both sustainable and convenient for our customers. We also joined the Outdoor Association's \tClimate Action Corps and committed to publishing climate-related goals in 2021. \n Today, as Lauren and Lee talk about another strong quarter, I remain as committed and as excited about our business as I've ever been. Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business during this very difficult year. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lauren."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our team. I am extremely proud of how our teammates managed through this challenging year. They came together to care for their communities, their families and each other. At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great, and I am so excited for our future and for what I know we will all accomplish together. \n Now on to our results. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered a record fourth quarter from both a sales and profitability perspective. Our Q4 consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3%, which was on top of our 5.3% comp increase in the same period of last year. Our strong comps were supported by significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as we continue to benefit from favorable shifts in consumer demand as well as strong execution from our team. \n From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores comped positively for a second straight quarter, increasing mid-single digits, and our eCommerce sales increased 57%, representing nearly 1/3 of our total business. Within eCommerce, we continue to see the strongest growth across in-store pickup and curbside, which increased nearly 250% compared to BOPIS sales in the prior year. These same-day services are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. In fact, during Q4, our stores enabled 90% of our total sales and fulfilled over 70% of our online sales, either through ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. \n During Q4, we again remain very disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 372 basis points. This merchandise margin expansion drove a significant improvement in gross margin, which on a non-GAAP basis increased 507 basis points. In total, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 represented an 84% increase over last year. \n It's clear that our strategies over the past several years are working and have helped us not only withstand the pandemic but thrive, setting us up for long-term success. As we enter 2021, our business has so much momentum, and we are pleased with the start to our year. Our focuses here will center around enhancing our existing strategies to accelerate our core and enable long-term growth. \n First, within merchandising. Our strategic partnerships with key brands have never been stronger, and we will continue to make big bets with important brand partners. At the same time, we will continue to elevate our vertical brands. As we've discussed on previous calls, our vertical brands have become a significant source of strength and growth. \n During 2020, our vertical brands eclipsed $1.3 billion in sales with comps outperforming the company average by over 400 basis points. Our DSG brand finished the year as our largest vertical brand, and CALIA was again our second-largest women's athletic apparel brand, only behind Nike. Furthermore, our vertical brands together represented the company's largest brand in golf, fitness, outdoor equipment and team sports. \n During 2021, we will invest in making our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in store and increased marketing while expanding into additional product categories. Later this month, we'll augment our men's apparel selection by launching VRST, our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male. VRST, which will only be available at DICK'S, will put us in a much stronger position to compete with similar offerings from premium apparel brands and specialty athletic apparel stores. \n Also in 2021, we will build on our momentum from 2020 and drive growth in important categories, including golf, athletic apparel, footwear and team sports, as well as in fitness, which saw significant gains throughout the pandemic. \n In 2020, our golf business across both DICK'S and Golf Galaxy was tremendous. As the country's largest golf retailer, we are very well positioned to capitalize on increased participation and other favorable trends. And in 2021, we will invest in TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience in our Golf Galaxy stores. We'll also enable online booking of lessons and club fittings, and we'll invest in talent to elevate our in-store service model. \n Additionally, in 2021, we plan to build on the strong results and momentum in our athletic apparel and footwear businesses. Our athletic apparel assortment for 2021 is on trend, and we're excited to continue the energy in this category beyond the pandemic. We will complete head-to-toe looks with a strong footwear assortment and presentation. As part of this, we'll convert over 100 additional stores to premium full-service footwear, taking this experience to over 60% of the DICK'S chain. We believe that these enhancements, along with strong consumer trends and improving allocations of the most in-demand styles, will drive continued positive results in our athletic apparel and footwear business. \n Lastly, we expect our team sports business to provide a nice tailwind during 2021, as kids get back out on the field following a year in which many seasons were canceled. Furthermore, we plan to reconceptualize our soccer business, an initiative we delayed last year because of COVID. We will follow the same playbook we used to attack the baseball category in 2019, centered around more premium product, enhanced store experiences and exceptional service. \n Beyond merchandising, in 2021, we'll focus on several key areas to enable the profitable growth of our business, including our omnichannel experience, data science and customer relationships. Within our omnichannel experience, we'll continue to lean on our stores as well as our eCommerce business to serve our customers whom we call athletes whenever, wherever and however they want. \n As Ed mentioned earlier, in 2020, our eCommerce sales increased 100%, partially driven by our curbside service that we launched in March and continuously improved throughout the year. Curbside pickup, along with fewer promotions and leverage of fixed costs, drove significant improvements in the profitability of our online channel in 2020. In 2021, we expect curbside to remain a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering as our athletes turn to the service for speed and convenience. \n In addition to curbside, we will continue to improve our online shopping experience. This includes leading with mobile, which for 2020 represented over 50% of our online sales. This also includes shortening the path to purchase and reducing delivery times as well as becoming a more consistent destination for our athletes' needs by offering a more integrated loyalty experience. Beyond online shopping through our game-changer technology, we will enhance our scorekeeping and live streaming offering for used sports with video-on-demand, all delivered through a premium subscription service. \n We will also continue building relationships with both new and existing athletes in our stores and online. In fact, a key to our omnichannel offering is our ScoreCard program, which in 2020 drove over 70% of total sales. In 2021, we will continue to use data science to leverage our extensive athlete database to drive more personalized one-to-one marketing to increase loyalty among the 8.5 million new athletes that we acquired in 2020, including more than 2.5 million new athletes added during Q4. \n Lastly, we are very excited to be opening our first experiential prototype store next week in Rochester, New York. This new DICK'S store called DICK'S House of Sport, will focus on service and community and allow us to innovate and deliver elevated experiences to our athletes, including an outdoor field to host sports events and promote product trial, a rock climbing wall and health and wellness spaces for in-store programming. It will serve as a test and learn center and will roll the most successful elements into our core DICK'S stores. \n As I look at our business, we are really in a great position. Our brick-and-mortar stores and our technology platforms are working seamlessly together to deliver an industry-leading omnichannel experience. We have world-class vertical brands, and our vendor relationships with key partners have never been stronger. We've become more athlete-centric, focusing on friendly, knowledgeable and available service. Importantly, we have a respected and loved brand and are aligned behind our common purpose to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams. \n In closing, we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and 2020 results and look forward to building on this success in 2021. \n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. We are not going to share our long-term guidance on what our operating margin will be going forward. However, we definitely view there is upside in the operating margin, and we plan to continue to deliver that over the next few years. We're just not laying down a commitment right now. Okay, Adrienne, thank you. So starting with the long-term store targets. I think one thing that has become very, very clear to us this year is that our stores are an enormous asset to us as part of our whole omnichannel ecosystem. And so we are -- we view our store growth and our eCommerce growth as very symbiotic and hand in hand, and so we will see us continuing to experiment with different types of store prototypes. We've got our new House of Sport that we mentioned, which is a larger prototype, and we will continue to be looking at where we would want to penetrate. That said, I would not expect a radical change in our store growth in the next few years. We laid out what we've got on plan for this year, and we'll continue to seize opportunities as they come up. \n Talking about team sports, frankly, we think there's a huge tailwind in team sports. There was a lot, obviously, of kids who did not get to play this past year. And while the season started a little slow year-to-date due to some cold weather and still COVID concerns, we fully believe -- football is sort of playing in many parts of the country now, and baseball is next. And we see team sports as a large and big tailwind, while people are still also buying golf and fitness and other outdoor activities that have become part of their new lifestyle. Lee, you want to take the port delays? Kate, I'll start with the golf business. We are incredibly bullish on the golf business. It has remained strong through the pandemic in the warm weather markets and still strong nationally across the board. So participation rates are up. There's new athletes in the golf sector, and we see a lot of growth ahead of us there. \n In terms of relocations, we definitely have multiple opportunities, and a big part of our strategy with real estate right now has been to either renegotiate or relocate. And we do see a nice pop when we do relocate into a new store from a sales and profit standpoint. Mike, thank you for your question, and I couldn't agree more with you. This is not just a pandemic bump that we had this past year. We have been, many years now, working on a new strategy to develop our entire omnichannel ecosystem to make the most out of our stores, to make the most out of our online sales. And I would say that, that on top of amazingly strong vendor relationships, which have only gotten stronger through the pandemic, the ecosystem that we've created with curbside now making our stores really pinnacled part of our digital experience, our technology investments over the past few years helped us, not just grow and spin up curbside in 2 days once the pandemic hit, but also leveraged our fixed expenses in a way that we couldn't have if we hadn't invested in technology a few years ago. So I do feel like -- we've had our best quarters right before the pandemic, and then we had our best quarters during the pandemic, and we look forward to returning to a little bit of normalcy and working through our operating model. Sorry, Mike, I just wanted to add one more thing, which is one of the most pleasing things to see over the past few quarters is that as we launched curbside and improved our digital and our eCommerce experience and then we opened up our stores, that our stores are comping positively, while we're still getting incredibly strong growth out of the eComm. So that feels like a long-lasting trend. It's cold. Yes. There is a mini football season going on. Who knew there was going to be a football in February or March, but there is. And yes, we need some Under Armour or some cold gear -- DSG [ brand ]. Yes. Chris, so hardlines were incredibly strong in the fourth quarter, and that's similar categories to what was doing well in Q3. But fitness, golf, outdoor equipment, which is where our bikes, paddle sports, all that -- the hardlines were really quite a champion. Despite supply constraints and challenges that we had getting a lot of product, they really dominated this year, but footwear -- this quarter and the year. But footwear and apparel also were strong. \n Lee, I'll turn it over to you to -- stimulus, we don't have -- we actually -- we do not -- we cannot quantify how much stimulus checks helped us and may help us in the future. It's not something we're planning against. There's just so much noise in the business in terms of trying to measure what the exact impact of that is that we're -- yes. The other piece I want to mention is that advertising expense this past year was pretty much nonexistent between March and May, while we were trying to figure out how we were going to manage liquidity through the pandemic. And so that is another cost that will be normalizing next year. Yes. Mike, we have had a significant increase in new customers over the course of this past year. We had 8.5 million new customers over the full year and 2.5 million in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with the makeup of the new customers. They tend to skew a little younger than our average former customer or current customer, a little bit slightly more female and slightly more urban. So we do think a lot of the exits from the cities are people engaged with the brand for the first time, and we're working very hard to keep those people in our database and encourage second purchases. But it's a huge -- it's a big piece of our growth. I couldn't hear the first part of your question, but I think you were asking is DICK'S able to lead a less promotional environment than 2019? Is that -- was that your question? We do not plan to be very promotional moving into. Of course, we will respond to any market pressure that we have or any environmental or economic pressure, but we do not plan to lead a hyperly promotional cycle here. And we believe we have the levers to manage appropriately through. I think the best way to answer that is just that, obviously, COVID restrictions have allowed different levels of activity. And team sports coming back and we are looking at the business that way and where they are coming back, we're seeing strength in those businesses. Thank you. Yes. John, there definitely was some demand we've been chasing all year in categories that were surging due to the pandemic and managing through it. So it's on a hand-to-mouth basis for some of these categories. We left some sales on the table, but let me turn it over to Lee. Yes. Scot, so the VRST brand that we mentioned, our new men's premium athletic apparel brand, we believe is very much a white space in our stores right now. It's competing with other specialty, but we do believe, when you see it, it will be -- it's a very different product assortment from what we have with our core vendor partners right now, and it is a white space. You can think of it sort of as the CALIA version on the men's side in terms of filling a white space that we have, that our current partners are just not -- are not in. Lifestyle. We're not going to share the IRR of the deck, other than to say that the decks have unlocked a lot of assortment and a much better athlete experience. And so it's really been a game changer, a very positive game changer for our entire footwear business. Yes. We're working on a relaunch of our mobile app. That said, mobile is already 50% of our eCommerce sales. And the plans we have right now are to fully integrate both the store experience and the ScoreCard experience into the online shoppers' experience, and in particular, making the mobile app the hub of the ScoreCard users -- the ScoreCard members' entire DICK'S experience. More to come. Yes. We are focused on the last mile, and we are focused on trying to improve the BOPIS profitability. But also, the profitability is great in that channel, but the customer experience -- so we're working on things like speed to athletes. So right now, people are getting notified that their BOPIS curbside order is ready. We promise under an hour. It's a lot faster than that, usually within 30 minutes or faster. Curbside wait is -- it's just a couple of minutes, very quick. And so we're trying to just make the experience become so convenient that people love it. And the other thing we did this past year is tested Instacart for same-day delivery, and that's just a small test to see whether our athletes want same-day delivery, and we'll be looking into that as the year goes on. Yes. Thanks, Tom. Just to clarify one thing. Our ScoreCard program has been around for actually many, many years, and 70% penetration has been similar for the past few years. We always hope it's going to increase, but it's a very, very high number as it is. What I think you're referring to is our ScoreCard Gold Program, which we launched probably about 18 months ago now, which is for our best customers who do account for our highest level of sales, over $500 a year is what the criteria is, and they contribute an awful lot of our total sales, are -- higher on an AUR -- every transaction, every lever is higher. It's a reasonable assumption. Okay. Thank you, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S, and a final thank you to our teammates for their amazing performance this year. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Lee Belitsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2020 results. Consolidated sales increased 9.5% to $9.58 billion, even though stores were closed to foot traffic during the spring, representing 16% of our store days closed on average for the year. Consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%. And within this, we delivered a 100% increase in eCommerce sales. And as a percent of total sales, our online business increased to 30% compared to 16% last year.\n Gross profit for the full year was $3.05 billion or 31.83% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, improved 249 basis points from last year. This improvement was driven by a merchandise margin rate expansion of 204 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 114 basis points, partially offset by shipping expenses resulting from meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth. Gross profit also included approximately $23 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $2.3 billion or 23.98% of net sales on a non-GAAP basis and leveraged 25 basis points from last year, primarily driven by the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $178 million compared to last year's non-GAAP results driven by $152 million of incremental COVID-related compensation, safety costs as well as a $30 million donation we made to the DICK'S Foundation to help jump-start youth sports programs struggling to come back from the pandemic. Apart from these items, increases in store payroll and operating expenses encouraged to support the increase in sales were offset by expense reductions, including advertising during our temporary store closures. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $733.3 million or 7.65% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $292.8 million or 262 basis points from the same period last year. In total, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.69 last year, a 66% year-over-year increase. \n Now moving to our Q4 results. Consolidated net sales increased 19.8% to approximately $3.13 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3% driven by a 20.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1% decrease in transactions. Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up mid-single digits, even though we were closed on Thanksgiving Day. Our eCommerce sales increased 57%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 32% compared to 25% last year. And lastly, we delivered significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear. \n Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or 33.67% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, improved 507 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by a merchandise margin rate expansion of 372 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 148 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions and lower clearance activity. \n In terms of shipping expense, we saw higher costs from shipped packages due to increased volume and industry-wide holiday surcharges. However, the higher average ticket, combined with higher penetration of in-store and curbside pickup, neutralized this impact from a basis point perspective. Specifically, for the fourth quarter, our curbside and in-store pickup sales increased nearly 250%. \n SG&A expenses were $761.2 million or 24.35% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $163 million or 142 basis points compared to last year. 27 basis points are attributable to the expense recognition associated with the change in value of our deferred comp plans, resulting from the increase in overall equity markets during the fourth quarter. This expense is fully offset in other income and has no net impact on earnings. The balance of the deleverage was primarily due to $47 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs as well as the $30 million donation made to the DICK'S Foundation, most of which was in Q4. These items were partially offset by leverage on other expenses from the significant sales increase. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $298.5 million or 9.55% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $149.9 million or 385 basis points from the same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32 last year, an 84% year-over-year increase. \n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $2.21. This included $7.2 million in noncash interest expense as well as 6.7 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement, but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, is both related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now moving on to our balance sheet. We're in a strong financial position, ending Q4 with nearly $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion (sic) [ $1.855 billion ] revolving credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels decreased 11% compared to the end of the same period last year. Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean, and we'll continue to chase product to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand category. \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $53 million, and we paid $27 million in quarterly dividends. \n Now let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings. Due to the uneven nature of 2020, we planned 2021 off of 2019 baseline and for the same reason believe it will be important to compare against both 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, given the continued uncertainty around when athlete activities will normalize in 2021 and what the new normal will be, we'll be guiding to a wider range of possible outcomes than we typically do. \n Let's start with the sales guidance followed by EBT dollars and rate and then onto EPS. For 2021, consolidated same-store sales are expected to be in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%, which at the midpoint represents a low-double-digit sales increase versus 2019. Our square footage versus 2019 is about the same. We have been pleased with our sales trends so far this year. And for the first quarter, we expect significant consolidated same-store sales and earnings growth as we anniversary the majority of our temporary store closures from last year. Beginning in Q2, our guidance assumes comps will decline in the range of high single digits to low double digits as we anniversary more than a 20% comp gain across those quarters in 2020. \n Non-GAAP EBT is expected to be in the range of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 36% versus 2019 and down 18% versus 2020. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to increase over 100 basis points versus 2019 and declined approximately 150 basis points versus 2020. Within this, gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019 driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins. When compared to 2020, gross margin is expected to decline due primarily to gradually normalizing promotions and modest deleverage on fixed expenses beginning in the second quarter. \n SG&A expense is expected to deleverage versus both 2019 and 2020. Compared to 2019, SG&A is expected to deleverage primarily due to hourly wage rate investments. Compared to 2020, SG&A is expected to deleverage primarily due to normalizing advertising expense as a percent of net sales. Our guidance also contemplates approximately $30 million of COVID-related safety costs during the first half of the year, the vast majority of which will fall within SG&A. \n In terms of our premium pay program for hourly in-store -- hourly store and DC teammates, at the beginning of fiscal 2021, we transitioned to more lasting compensation programs, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums. The impact of these programs has also been included within our guidance but falls outside of the aforementioned COVID costs as these changes are now permanent. \n Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.40 to $5.20, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 30% versus 2019 and down 22% versus 2020. Our earnings guidance is based on 96 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. This is lower than our traditional tax rate and is due to the favorable tax impact of share-based payments expected to vest in 2021. \n Our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditures of $275 million to $300 million, which will be concentrated in improvements within our existing stores, ongoing investments in technology as well as 6 new DICK'S stores, 6 new specialty concept stores, and we will also convert 2 Field & Stream stores into Public Lands stores and relocate 11 DICK'S stores. \n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 16% to $0.3625 per share or $1.45 on an annualized basis. In addition, our plan includes a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider continuing to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $200 million. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our 2020 results. We are looking forward to continuing this success in 2021, and we remain very enthusiastic about our business. \n Before concluding, I want to highlight a new investor presentation that will be posted to our Investor Relations website later today. The intent of this presentation is to serve as a resource to provide current and prospective investors an overview of our company, strategy and competitive differentiation. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. \n Operator, you may now open the line for questions. The business -- the merchandise margin rates that we've obtained during the second through fourth quarter this year were largely attributable to fewer -- far fewer promotions than we've had. And we haven't thus far seen the need to add back promotions. But as we get into the year and we believe that the supply of merchandise will become more plentiful out there, that there's a potential that the industry will return to more normal promotional levels as we get through the year. It's hard to say exactly when that will happen or to what extent it will happen, but we're planning on the merchandise margins gradually adding back promotions, looking really at Q2 through Q4. \n We don't intend to lead the promotional charge there. It's not really our approach to this, but we will have to react if the marketplace goes there. Right now, inventories are in good shape but are light kind of across the industry and across categories right now. So we don't see anything imminent, but we're being cautious about kind of the back half of the year this year with respect to promotions. I would just add to that, that I think we want to see how the business settles out once we get past kind of the pandemic-driven demand and how much of that demand we hold on to. We believe a lot of it's just new normal, and we'll come out of this at a meaningfully higher level of sales, but we'd like to see where that settles in. So we understand what the base is that we can build off of going forward. So we'll have more information on this probably later in the year this year. Yes. I'm not really prepared to comment on the math now, but we do believe that this will -- there continues to be opportunity on the gross margin side. So with regard to supply chain, we have seen some delays across some product categories that we have. Our inventories are a little bit lower than we would like them to be. We were a little bit constrained in the fourth quarter, not so much to do with port delays, but due to some categories of merchandise not being manufactured as highly as we would have liked. But we don't anticipate that being a significant impediment to our business at this point. \n Now that could change. It looks like the supply chain issues, I'd say, over the last couple of weeks, have got a little bit better. They have been trending worse for a while, but it seems like what we see Asia is catching up a little bit right now. The ports are getting a little bit better in the U.S., and we're in a pretty good inventory position at this point. So we don't really see that as an impediment to doing the business we need to do over the next couple of quarters. We're really pleased with our quarter-to-date sales, so we'll leave this at... Yes. The big driver on the relocations is more the lift in sales we get from it than the savings in rent. Sometimes, the rent is reduced. But typically, we get a fresh new store, and we see a significant sales and profitability lift as well. Our new stores continue to perform very well as well, so we're -- we've been selective in picking our targets for new stores, and the economics have been very good. So we're not discouraged from opening new stores in any way, but we do want to continue to be selective. And just to add to Lauren's comments, from a consumer trends perspective and activities trend, we're excited about some of the new habits that our athletes have picked up during the year, whether it's golf or running or other outdoor activities that require footwear, athletic apparel and so on, in addition to some -- what's likely to be some more work from home, which should add more time to people's lifestyle. So we like the product trends going forward, and we think that demand is going to settle in at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic as well as a result of all these new activities that our athletes have got engaged with. Well, a couple of things. I'll address a couple of questions. With regard to working capital, we are planning to end '21 with our inventory levels approximately even to 2019. So we expect the sales to be up about low double digits. I think the math comes out to like 11%, and we expect the inventory to be about the same at the end of '19. So while the inventory turn will probably be a little bit lower than it is in 2020, we expect it to be meaningfully higher than it was in 2019. The accounts payable leverage will be greater than 2019, will be less than 2020, but there's no unusual drain on working capital as expected. \n With regard to share buybacks, we've set it at a minimum of $200 million for this year. And we've also said that -- and that's what we baked into the forecast right now, but we'll also look at the pace of our business as we go forward and measure that, measure what's happening with the pandemic. And if there are any changes to demand resulting from that in our business, we leave open the possibility of buying back more shares that's appropriate for the business. Yes. So we're planning our eCommerce business to be down versus 2020. We just had a really unusual lift in the business, particularly in the back half of the first quarter and into the second quarter when the stores were closed. So we're going to come up against some really big eCommerce numbers. Certainly, our run rate in the eCommerce business coming out of Q4 is a lot higher than it was last year, so we're very optimistic about the eComm business. So that's good for us. \n The AURs have been good for us there. We're using ship from -- excuse me, we're using curbside, pickup and in-store pickup as well, which doesn't have a delivery cost. So the impact on our overall gross margins shouldn't be significant from the eComm business coming down as a percent of the mix modestly. Yes. So a couple of points there, $175 million. We got $163 million of -- excuse me, $175 million of COVID costs do not include the $30 million of additional foundation contributions. So those are -- were incremental in 2020. However, the COVID costs, going forward, a large piece of that has been kind of reallocated into more permanent wage increases. We continue to see wage pressures in order to get the right kind of talent in our stores. We're continuing to have to invest more in our hourly wages to maintain those -- the right kind of people, both in our stores and our distribution centers. So a large part of that is being reinvested, as you said, going forward. I would say it's versus our guidance for this year. If you take the midpoint of our guidance, we think we can establish that as a new base and then keep building off of that. So it's over 6% operating margin we can build from there. Well, we've got about 2/3 of the leases coming due over the next 5 years, and we have an option on those leases. As we go forward in the majority of those stores, as we negotiate new leases, we've been able to negotiate reductions along the way. It also gives us leverage to drive better deals when we relocate stores. So I would expect modest declines year-over-year in the rent line, going forward, as we have all along. Mix in 2021 should be a little bit favorable to 2020 because the strongest part of the business in 2020 was really in the hardlines categories, outdoor equipment, fitness and so on. And as we go forward, we expect to see a recovery in team sports. We can expect to see continued strength in athletic apparel, in the athletic footwear businesses, which are higher margin businesses. In addition to that, we expect to see our private brands -- our vertical brands continue to grow, which is also a positive from a mix perspective. And the hunt business coming down, which should be favorable from a margin perspective. So there are some basis points of mixed favorability I would expect to see in 2021. \n With regard to the competitive landscape, I don't see that much changing from a brick-and-mortar perspective. I think the sporting goods sector is generally in good shape right now. The pandemic has spurred sales across our sector, so I don't expect to see closures really in any kind of meaningful way this year. \n With regard to department stores, some of the department stores are closing some stores, which should be favorable. But on the other hand, some of them are going after kind of the athletic apparel space a little bit more aggressively, which will work the other way. So long and short of it, I don't really see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape this year in the brick-and-mortar space. Yes. I mean the categories that we were chasing all year were fitness, kayaks and golf equipment and athletic apparel. So certainly, if we had more inventory over the course of the year in certain key categories, our sales would have been higher. We are in much better shape in inventory right now. So we're down 10%. We feel pretty good about our inventory levels right now. There's still a few pockets where we're short, but we don't have the kind of widespread inventory outages that we did through mid and the latter part of the year last year. Well, that remains to play out, I think, for us to take a look at it and see how well the big-ticket items hold up. Part of the reason the average retail is up so much because we were less promotional, so that drove a lot of the average ticket. But we did have strength in big-ticket items like in the fitness area, in kayaks, golf clubs and so on. And I think we feel really good about the golf business. We feel good about all of those categories right now. And time will tell as we get later in the year when the new activities kind of normalize, what will happen to the sales there. I would say it's closer to lululemon, and the assortments that they've got, it's more a... It's lifestyle apparel that you can wear to work, you can travel in. There is -- you can work out in it if you choose to. So it covers a broader range of activities than kind of the Nike, which is a little bit more athlete focused than our new brand that's coming out. We really run on a return on investment, and we're -- and in our new stores, the hurdle that we're aiming for is at least an 18% IRR on the stores, including relocations have to be an IRR over, if we've remained in the existing store so in order to spur the new investment. And typically, we can do that because we get a large sales lift out of the stores when they move. I would say the largest one, we believe, will be the merchandise margin being higher due to mix shift and due to better promotions management, particularly online. I'd say that's the largest. I'd say the second largest is going to be around leverage of occupancy expense. To the extent we've got the same square footage in 2021 as we did in '19 and we're able to continue to drive some rent reductions along the way, we should be able to continue to leverage our occupancy expense. \n Going the other way, as eCommerce is a larger part of the business, there is some pressure from additional delivery expenses to get products to customers. We did a really good job in the fourth quarter, mitigating that through more BOPIS and curbside pickup and higher AURs. We think we'll be able to hold on to some of that, but it will be a constant, very detailed management effort on our expenses there to try to keep that down. But I would expect versus '19, the delivery expenses to run a little bit higher as a percent of sales from the eCommerce business. So versus '19, the main drivers of growth are really our store payroll expenses, and that's really driven by higher wage rates that are across the board. I'm not going to comment on the exact amount that it's going up, but the deleverage that we are experiencing is really attributable to that factor, the hourly wage rates. Advertising is in good shape. Admin expenses are in good shape as well, so it's really driven by store payroll. I don't have a comment on that at this point. Not really. Not really. As we know, we got investments coming in throughout the year this year, a partial year of depreciation expense. It's not really a headwind for this year."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.  \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.  \n Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call.  \n And finally, a couple of admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers.  \n And second, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings release before the market opens on March 9, 2021, with our subsequent earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to discuss the executive transition we announced this morning.  \n As of February 1, 2021, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman while continuing my responsibilities as Chief Merchant. I'll also oversee the strategic growth initiatives for the company.  As I make this transition, I want everyone to know, as the largest and controlling shareholder of DICK'S Sporting Goods, I remain as committed and as excited about this business as I have ever been.  \n The Board unanimously elected Lauren as President and CEO of DICK'S, also effective February 1. Lauren brings more than 25 years of finance, consumer and retail experience, having spent 5 years in banking and 14 years at PepsiCo in various leadership roles before joining us nearly a decade ago as our Chief Marketing Officer. She was appointed President in 2017 and joined the Board the following year. Since joining the company, Lauren has been instrumental to our growth and success, revamping our marketing efforts, helping drive our robust omni-channel offering and elevating our athletes' experience. Lauren's appointment is an important step in the Succession Planning Committee's process to put the right leadership in place. Our business is thriving. We have the best management team in the company's history, making this the perfect time for the transition.\n I'd now like to turn it over to Lauren for a few words. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by extending a heartfelt thank you to Ed. He built this company from the ground up, and it is because of his ability to look around corners, innovate, take risks, and develop and nurture talent, all while never losing sight of our values and making sure that we're a good member of our communities, that DICK'S is what it is today. It is truly an honor working alongside him.\n I also want to thank our Board and our teammates. I look forward to continuing to work with them, the rest of the extended DICK'S family and all of you in the coming months and years ahead. Under Ed's leadership, we've accomplished so much, fostering a stronger and more inclusive culture and developing a powerful omni-channel experience for our athletes. We're in great shape from both a financial and managerial standpoint, and I look forward to continuing to work with Ed to lead DICK'S into the next phase of its growth.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Ed to discuss the third quarter results. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Lauren. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter from both a sales and profitability perspective. The strength of our diverse category portfolio once again helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand as the trends across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle continued throughout the third quarter.  \n Our Q3 consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 23.2% and was on top of our 6% comp increase in the same period last year. Our stores were the key to this unprecedented growth and serve as the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel experience. Brick-and-mortar stores comps grew double digits, and our stores fulfilled 70% of our online sales, which increased nearly 100% for the quarter. In fact, our stores drove 90% of our total Q3 sales growth, whether an athlete purchased at the register, picked up curbside or had their order delivered to their home through ship-from-store.  We saw increases in both average ticket and transactions as well as significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.  \n Lastly, our private brands continue to be a significant source of strength with comps outperforming the company average by over 1,000 basis points. I'll talk a little more about private brands later.  \n During Q3, we remained very disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace remained supply-constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 277 basis points. This merchandise margin expansion contributed to a significant improvement in gross margin, which increased 532 basis points. In total, our third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 represented a 287% increase over last year.  \n Now let me touch on the fourth quarter performance to date. Overall, the favorable trends in our business have continued into Q4. These strong results have been partially offset by warmer weather that has negatively impacted sales in the important cold-weather categories. Taken together, through this past weekend, our comp sales have increased in the high teens.\n As I look at our business, we have a lot to be excited about. One of the strategies I'm most enthusiastic about is our private brand strategy, which we now refer to as our vertical brands. There can be a perception that private brand or private label means opening price point. In contrast, our vertical brands are high-quality on-trend brands with compelling technical and performance attributes. These vertical brands have clear DNA and specific consumer targets for which we control everything, including design, supply chain and marketing.\n We've already done some great things to date. In just 5 years CALIA, which services the trend-right athletic female at premium price points, has become the second-largest women's brand in our company. Our DSG brand, which spans men's, women's and youth athletic apparel, as well as hardlines categories, has also been extremely successful and has grown to become our largest vertical brand just 1 year following its launch. Collectively, our vertical golf equipment and apparel brands represent our #1 brand in golf, while Fitness Gear is our single largest fitness brand.  \n Looking ahead, we will invest in making our vertical brands even stronger. This includes improved space in store, increased marketing and expanding into additional product categories. At the same time, we will also continue to invest in our strategic partnerships with key national brands such as Nike, Callaway and The North Face. We recognize that these important brands are real differentiating factors that create authenticity and credibility with our athletes.\n As I discussed on the last quarter's call, we're really in a great lane right now. We deliver a premium, multi-branded assortment that is well tailored to the consumer trends. We have an industry-leading omni-channel experience with rapidly growing and a highly profitable eCommerce business. And importantly, we are in a strong financial position with nearly $1.1 billion in cash.\n Before concluding, I want to address something incredibly important to our country, our company, and to me personally. The recent racial injustices across our nation led us and many companies to take an honest and critical look inside our organization. We realized we had work to do and committed to make DICK'S be a more inclusive and diverse company. This change started at the top. And over the past several months, we brought a much-needed diverse perspective to our Board of Directors.  \n Furthermore, our Inclusion and Diversity Council, which was launched last year and is comprised of a group of teammates who represent a wide range of backgrounds, roles and communities, established nearly 20 impact teams to accelerate our efforts. We have already delivered meaningful progress in several areas, including adopting a new recruitment and talent development process to build a more diverse workforce and expanding inclusivity training across our entire organization. Earlier this month, we published this year's Purpose Playbook, where you can read more about our efforts to drive positive change in our communities and our world. Separately, we announced our investment in the Black Economic Development Fund, which supports black-owned banks and financing for minority businesses, charter schools, affordable housing and athletic facilities.\n Today, as we talk about another strong quarter as a team, I cannot be more pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. And I want to thank all of our 45,000 teammates, especially our frontline workers in our stores and distribution centers, for their hard work and unwavering dedication to safely serving our athletes. As the retail industry continues to evolve, DICK'S will continue to lead the way, and I look forward to working with Lauren and the entire team to build our success and deliver sustained value to our shareholders.  \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Ed. I want to start also by thanking our teammates. They continue to serve our athletes and our communities safely, and their efforts helped us execute a seamless omni-channel experience and deliver a record-setting comp sales increase for Q3. I am so grateful to work alongside and support each of them.  \n Our third quarter performance reflected a strong, well-balanced omni-channel offering with both our stores and eCommerce delivering exceptional results. In fact, our brick-and-mortar store comps increased double digits, the best quarterly store comp performance in our history as a public company. Our online sales increased 95%, representing 21% of our total business compared to 13% in the third quarter of last year.\n Year-to-date, our eCommerce sales of over $1.8 billion have already surpassed our full year eCommerce sales in 2019, even with the holiday shopping season still ahead of us. Within eCommerce in the third quarter, mobile sales penetration was over 50%, and we saw a significant increase in mobile app downloads. Importantly, this incredible strength in our eCommerce business happened with all of our stores fully open throughout the quarter.\n Our stores are the hub of our omni-channel experience. They serve our in-store athletes while also providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. In the third quarter, even while facing exceptionally high levels of omni-channel demand, our stores fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales. This includes curbside and in-store pickup, which increased over 300% when compared to BOPIS sales last year. With curbside available at all of our stores, the service is widely accessible, and our athletes are responding well to the same-day convenience that it offers. In fact, in the third quarter, our curbside athletes shopped more frequently, transacting 20% more often than our non-curbside eCommerce athletes. We continue to make enhancements to the service, including the ability to do curbside returns, and we've got dedicated parking spaces at nearly all of our stores, along with improved way-finding and signage. While we initially launched curbside as a stopgap to provide a safe and contactless solution to our athletes as a result of COVID-19, it's become quite clear that it is a highly convenient way to shop that is here to stay.  \n Importantly, while our eCommerce business continues to be highly successful and penetration continues to increase, we also continue to improve the profitability of the channel, especially as stores play a larger role in fulfillment. In the third quarter, we saw significant improvement in eCommerce gross margins driven by higher penetration of curbside and BOPIS sales as well as fewer promotions and leverage of fixed costs.  \n Furthermore, we continue to make technology enhancements to provide an increasingly seamless omni-channel experience. In fact, as part of this year's holiday campaign, we're highlighting the technology and logistics systems in our supply chain in a unique and an engaging way. From a store perspective, we recently rolled out a contactless, self-checkout app called Scan, Pay, & Play to over 300 stores, which enables an efficient checkout solution for our athletes while also giving them the ability to quickly look up pricing information and product descriptions as they shop in our stores. We will continue to refine this technology and roll it out to additional stores in the near future.\n We also recently launched HOME PLATE, a mobile communications app that provides our store teammates with real-time metrics and important communications all while on the sales floor, giving them more time to focus on providing great service to athletes.  \n Another key to our omni-channel offering is our ScoreCard loyalty program, which provides robust data that we can leverage to increase engagement and drive traffic. With over 20 million active members, our ScoreCard loyalty program drives over 70% of total sales through more meaningful and effective personalized offers and communications. We value our ScoreCard loyalty members deeply. And with members spending approximately 30% more per transaction than nonmembers, retaining existing members and bringing new customers into the program is extremely important to us.\n Speaking of new customers, in the third quarter, nearly 2 million new customers joined the DICK'S Sporting Goods ecosystem, with sales from new customers increasing over 70% compared to last year. Relative to our existing customers, our new customers skew female and younger, representing a great opportunity for future growth.  \n In closing, as we continue to refine and enhance our industry-leading omni-channel experience, data science and technology have never been more important. They're the keys to creating a personalized one-to-one relationship with our athletes and serving them in the most convenient way possible. Looking to the fourth quarter, we're very enthusiastic about our business, and we look forward to serving athletes this holiday season.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results.\n Consolidated sales increased 22.9% to approximately $2.41 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 23.2% driven by a 19.6% increase in average ticket and a 3.6% increase in transactions. Brick-and-mortar comps grew double digits. Our eCommerce sales increased 95%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 21% compared to 13% last year. And lastly, we delivered significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.\n Gross profit in the third quarter was $842.2 million or 34.91% of net sales, a 532 basis point improvement compared to last year. This improvement was driven primarily by merchandise margin rate expansion of 277 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 259 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions. Gross profit also included about $4 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $591.1 million or 24.51% of net sales and on a non-GAAP basis leveraged 174 basis points from last year. This leverage was primarily driven by our significant sales increase as well as strong expense control efforts. As expected, this was partially offset by $44 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.  \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, along with our disciplined expense management, non-GAAP EBT was $243.8 million or 10.11% of net sales and on a non-GAAP basis increased $183.8 million or 706 basis points from the same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 last year, a 287% year-over-year increase.\n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $1.84. This included $6.7 million of noncash interest expense as well as 6 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement but required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to the convertible notes that were issued in Q1. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now I'll briefly review our 2020 year-to-date results. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May, consolidated same-store sales have increased 5.8%, and that was on top of our 3.1% comp increase in the first 39 weeks last year. Within this, our eCommerce sales have increased 135%. And as a percent of net sales, our online business increased to 28% compared to 13% last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.65. This included $124 million or $1.01 per diluted share of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs, and it compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.39 for the first 39 weeks last year, a 53% year-over-year increase.  \n Now moving to our balance sheet. As Ed stated, we are in a strong financial position, ending Q3 with nearly $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. \n Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 9.8% compared to the same period last year. Looking ahead, our inventory is clean, and we will continue to chase product to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand categories.\n Touching on our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $51 million, and we paid $26 million in quarterly dividends.\n With respect to our full year outlook, there's still high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of key external factors. Given this uncertainty, we will not be providing a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. We will continue to reassess the practicality of resuming guidance in future quarters. While mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we are extremely pleased with our significant Q3 results as well as our Q4 sales trends. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods.  \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Ed, congratulations, and Lauren, congratulations, too. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks. \nEdward Stack: Thank you. \nKatharine McShane: My question, first, was just around back-to-school. I know you mentioned last quarter, it started off a little bit slower, as it did for most retailers. And with your Team Sports exposure, I know it must have been a little bit of a drag. But just was wondering if you did see any pickup in back-to-school as the quarter went on and schools opened a little later. And with certain sports staying outside longer, did Team Sports improve at all? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I think when we last had our quarterly announcement, I think we were up 11% in the quarter, and we had been through a back-to-school that was a little delayed and Team Sports were slow. That did improve as the quarter went on. There was some delay in Team Sports and a delay, frankly, in some of the back-to-school categories that helped contribute to the strong growth. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question is just about your omni-channel efforts. I know a lot of investment has been accelerated and pulled forward, but are there any major capabilities that you need to invest in at this point? Or are you pretty happy with how you're positioned now once we kind of exit the pandemic? \nLauren Hobart: No. I think our platforms are very capable and have enabled us to innovate as much as we have, including spinning up the curbside so quickly and now the Scan, Pay, & Play app. We've improved our teammate efficiency with technology. We feel we're in a very good place from a technology platform and foundation standpoint. \nOperator: And the next question will be from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes. Ed, thanks for all the work driving the strategy. And Lauren, congratulations. Lauren, my question is on -- inventory position at the end of the fourth quarter and frankly coming into this quarter was very clean. It does not seem to be comping the sales demand or your ability to fulfill the demand. Is that because you are majority branded and have access to replenishment fairly quickly? And then as you look at spring and see the demand from stores opening, how are you envisioning building inventory into that demand?\n And then, Lee, my second question for you. A lot of retailers who have put up these huge margin growth year-on-year, they've discussed which portion of the margin expansion are permanent and which are more onetime in nature and that we should be cautious about modeling going forward. If you could help us with that, that would be great. \nLauren Hobart: Great. Adrienne, I'll start off. So in terms of our inventory position at the end of Q3 coming into Q4, you're right, our inventory is clean, it's good. We are still chasing in several key categories. And if you were to ask whether we have left some sales on the table, it's likely that we have. But I do agree with you that our preferred-partner, strategic-partner status with some of our key vendors has enabled us to keep a steady supply chain coming through and is helping us with the tailwinds that we have already.\n As we go into spring, we're making all the reasonable bets that one would make, expecting certain key trends to continue, and in fact, some of the ones that started this year that we believe will continue on, things like golf, as well as some other fitness activities and then of course hoping for a strong return to school and Team Sports in the spring as well. Lee? \nLee Belitsky: With regard to margin, we've seen some great improvement in our gross margin rates over the last couple of quarters. And as we look forward, reflecting on it a bit, I think that some of the items that will tend to be permanent will be leverage over some of our fixed fulfillment costs. We've built a couple of distribution centers for eComm fulfillment last year, and we've been able to leverage those costs, plus we didn't have -- we're past the start-up costs of those. Curbside pickup represents a big leverage point for us because we don't incur shipping expenses to ship products to customers. And to the extent that we've had significant adoption there, and that continues, which we believe it will, that represents permanent gross margin improvement. I believe that the growth of our private brands that we can continue to invest in have a higher gross margin profile than the national brand, so we're excited about that.  \n And we've also been able to pull back pretty meaningfully on site-wide promotions on our eCommerce site. We believe that some of that will be permanent going forward. It remains to be determined really as we get into next year and everybody gets back in stock, but it's our intention to really be much more cautious with site-wide promotions going forward.\n Some of the things are also temporary, it's hard to say. A lot of it's going to be around the promotional environment going forward. We have been able to be less promotional because there's been a lot of product shortages out there, and we haven't had to put product on sale. And frankly, we haven't owned enough product in a lot of categories to put it on sale and provide a great customer experience there. So that one, which is a big lever for us, is -- remains to be seen. We'll probably give some of that back as inventory levels normalize.\n Some of the leverage that we're getting over are fixed rent expenses. We continue to be able to bring down -- modestly bring down our rent expense each year through better leverage and negotiating our rent deals and rent renewals, and we expect that to be permanent as well. Some of that -- a lot of that leverage is driven by higher sales. So to the extent we can drive -- continue to drive higher sales going forward will create leverage over all of our fixed costs, both rent and our fixed distribution costs as well. \nOperator: And the next question will be from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: First, Lauren, congrats on your new expanded role. And then my -- it's really a follow-up question on the last question, probably for Ed as the Chief Merchant. Obviously, some tough comparisons next year. We get a lot of questions about how much is pent-up demand that you're seeing right now from earlier this year, how much is pull-forward. Can you just give us some color, as a merchant, how you think about next year and things that we should think about?  \n Another question would be on Team Sports. How big is that as a percent of your business? And is Team Sports, is that down this year? Or how is that overall looking? And is that an opportunity for next year? Maybe some of the puts and takes that we should be thinking about as we make our guesses about how next year can play out for you guys from a sales standpoint. \nEdward Stack: Sure. Thanks, Robby. I don't think it's pent-up demand any longer. I think in the second quarter there was probably some pent-up demand. But now I just think it's a transformation of what people are doing and what they want to do to not only be safe, be in better physical condition, from what's happening in our running business, our athletic apparel business, the fitness business, but also the fact that they want to get outdoors and do things and they want to feel safe. And being outdoors is talked about one of the safest places to be. So people are playing golf. They're running. They're kayaking. They're doing all of those things.  \n And I do think that going into next year, we remain pretty optimistic because as some people have come back into some of these activities or have taken them up for the first time, they've realized they really enjoy this. They may have done it because they had nothing else to do, but they've gotten to the point where they've really realized that they like golf or they like golf again or they like to be out hiking with their families. So we think this is sustainable.  \n And as we take a look at next year, our Team Sports business is not good right now. Certain categories are a little bit better than others. Baseball is pretty good, but other ones have been difficult. And we do think that the Team Sports business, there will be quite a bit of pent-up demand next year that will help us offset some of the tough comps that we're going to have this year.\n We're not providing guidance into next year, I think it's really too early to tell, but we think we're in a very good lane. I think that how people view their lifestyle is not going to meaningfully change next year. They're still going to want to be outside. They're still going to want to be active. They're still going to want to play golf. I think the work-from-home change is good for our business from the fact of the clothes that people are buying. And I don't believe next year we're going to be fully back to being in an office from 9 to 5, 5 days a week. I don't know if we're ever going to go and do that. I know in our company we're talking about what we think the office environment will look like going forward. And quite frankly, we don't see it 5 days a week going forward.\n So we're in a pretty good lane. We're pretty enthusiastic. The changes that we've made in our business from an online standpoint, the technology investments that we've made over the last several years have really started to pay off. We got a little bit lucky with the timing. We said that they were starting to pay off and we're starting to see those, and then COVID hit. And that online component, that digital component of our business was so very important, and we are so pleased that we made those investments a few years ago. So Robby, we're as optimistic as we can be about not only our business going forward the balance of this year but into next year also. \nOperator: And the next question will be from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Ed and Lauren, congratulations. My first question on the margins, and related more to gross margin. One of the frameworks we were thinking about for 2021 is anchoring it to 2019. And I want to ask about gross margin in particular. So promotions will likely normalize; Lee, you mentioned that. But we were thinking that gross margins can still be higher than they were pre-COVID because of the other things you mentioned: private brands, lower fulfillment costs, et cetera. Is that a fair way to think about it? \nLee Belitsky: I think for the most part, yes. With regard to promotions, I don't know that they'll go back to 2019 levels. I don't think we really know for certain. It will be our intention going into next year that we wouldn't return to 2019 levels, that we'd certainly start out the year being less promotional. And then we'll see how the year evolves from there. But it's -- we're not just going to pull out the 2019 promotional cadence and go back to that as we go into next year. \nEdward Stack: Yes, Simeon. I think it will be higher for a couple of reasons. As Lee said, I don't think we're going to get really that promotional as we were in '19. I think there's also a couple of other things that are working in our favor, which is mix. So the firearms business and the hunt business will be meaningfully less for us in 2021 than it was in 2020 -- or in 2019, and that mix will help our margins. The private brands will help our margins. The way that we've differentiated product that we buy in the marketplace from our key brands will help that mix. So we are anticipating that the merchandise gross margin level will be better in '21 than it was in '19. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is, I don't think you mentioned lower fulfillment costs year-over-year in the gross margin bridge. Can you mention how that's having an impact? And realizing that you may not have the same level of comp growth at the store level but if you're going to mix back to eComm in some way and shipping, how the fulfillment costs -- or curbside even, how the fulfillment costs benefit could help the gross margin line as well? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Simeon, the more curbside certainly helps the gross margin line, and we saw that this quarter. The whole profitability of the channel, the eCommerce channel, has improved, and a lot of that's due to things like that as well as just leverage of some of our investments from the past. So we didn't mention it because it didn't have a material impact on the quarter due to some leverage that we had in the gross margin line. There were increased shipping expenses, obviously, due to the fact that eComm was up 95%. But net-net, it didn't have a material impact on the margin for the quarter. \nEdward Stack: I think that it's definitely going to be -- as a percent, I think we can make some positive changes there. Because as Lauren said, the curbside pickup, what -- we've started to see that what started out as a service from a public health standpoint has now migrated to be a convenience standpoint for the athletes that we serve. And we've gotten so many really positive comments about how Lauren and the team and Don and his team in the stores have executed this. We think that's going to continue to be a bigger part of our business, which will help leverage the costs from an eCommerce standpoint, a digital standpoint. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Congrats, everybody. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin and specifically how you're planning the fourth quarter. Just what is your sense of promotions so far in the fourth quarter? And how are you planning for that?  \n And then I guess related, inventory levels in cold-weather categories, is there any sort of risk if the weather doesn't turn? How are you thinking about that? \nLauren Hobart: So for gross margin, we're not going to get into how we're planning Q4 other than to say we'll know a lot more in a week or 2 how Q4 is going to look. But we are quite confident and optimistic and happy with our quarter-to-date results that we shared on the call.  \n Cold weather is obviously important to us in the fall, in the winter. We often have said, I'll quote Ed on this one, that if we're playing golf in December, it's not great for the outerwear business. It is good for the golf business, however, which is great. But we have a good inventory position. We've got the product. We think people are going to want to be outside even more and need to be outside. So we don't perceive that we have a significant inventory risk there. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And then from an investment perspective, Lee, I may have missed this, but I think CapEx has been running below your original expectations year-to-date. Are you still expecting some level of catch-up in '21? If you could just give us some context on that. And then also, does that have any implications from an SG&A perspective? Where do we stand relative to prior years where you did have higher SG&A growth? Are we at a more stable run rate as we think about that over the next couple of years? \nLee Belitsky: Well, with regards to capital expenditures, we did defer a couple of initiatives into next year. One that we had planned on for this year was kind of the completion of space reallocation of 440 stores out of hunt and into other more productive categories. We completed 200 of those stores. We have about 240 to go that we've deferred into next year. So we'll get going on those as we get into the first quarter of next year. There are certain other in-store programs that we deferred to next year, some around technology in the golf space, around making some improvement in our premium full-service footwear decks and expanding those as well. So certain of those CapEx have been deferred into next year.\n I really don't want to comment right now on what our SG&A expense run rates are for next year as we're kind of still working through our budgeting process for next year, and we'll give you some more details on that as we get into the annual, the year-end call in March. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Ed and Lauren, congratulations. So DICK'S is going to be on pace to have, call it, a 7.5% operating margin this year. It's still below where DICK'S peaked out a few years ago at 9%. Obviously, the eCommerce penetration of the business is much higher today than where it was 5 months ago when DICK'S had a 9% operating margin. But is it reasonable to expect with all the changes that the company is making that you can get back there or even see growth off of this level where you're going to be today? \nLee Belitsky: Well, Michael, one of the things you have to think about is we have about I think it's $170 million of COVID expenses in there, which is impacting our operating margins nearly 200 basis points this year, and we didn't have that back then. So we still think that we can make some meaningful improvements in our operating margins going forward, and we're optimistic about having that opportunity, both in gross margin rates. As we continue to address our occupancy expenses and the changes that we've made in our merchandise assortments around hunting and private brands and working with our key vendors as they continue to narrow their distribution, it could reduce the pressure on promotions going forward. So we believe there is a lot of opportunity to increase our operating margins going forward. \nMichael Lasser: And Lee, just to clarify, is your point around COVID costs an indication that those are going to be permanent or you expect them to roll off as we move into the next phase of this situation? \nLee Belitsky: We're still working through that on how much it's going to carry into next year as COVID goes forward. Probably, there continues to be some pressure on wage rates in the stores. But -- and certain things that we've got like ambassadors, people standing at the front of the store, handing out masks and doing customer counts in and out of stores and cleaning expenses and things like that will go away. And some of the wage rate pressure that we've got this year around paying hero pay will go away. But wage rates continue to be under pressure going forward, and we still have to assess how that will be -- what impact that will have for next year. \nMichael Lasser: That's helpful. And if I could add a follow-up question. I'm curious about your perspective on some of the demand that's being pulled forward. There were categories like bicycles and free weights that were very strong earlier this year. Are you seeing a continuation of those categories that were in heavy demand? Or is it just -- has the business transitioned from strength in those areas into strength in others? And what does that say about as we get into next year about some of this? \nEdward Stack: They have continued, and we expect them to continue. As I said before, I think people realize that the best way to stay healthy is to be in better shape. And riding a bike, working on a treadmill or dumbbells I think is something that's here to stay for some time into the future because people do realize that to get through this pandemic and whether -- other health crisis they may have personally or we may have in the world, that we just need to be in better shape. And I think people have -- that lifestyle, if you will, is not going to change anytime soon. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: I think you guys mentioned adding 2 million new customers this quarter, highly concentrated younger or skewed younger and female. Just curious what they're buying as they kind of get introduced to the concept. What are they spending money on initially?  \n And also, separate, can you talk a little bit about your footwear business and what price strata has been the strongest for you guys, how AURs are trending in that category? \nLauren Hobart: With regard to the 2 million new customers, they do skew younger. They skew slightly more female. That's relative to our norm and just in those new customers. They also skew slightly more urban, which we think might have something to do with the urban -- people start leaving the urban centers and going out into the suburbs.  \n In terms of what are they buying, they're buying everything that has driven our comps this quarter. So it's exactly what we've been saying in terms of the surging categories, but they're buying fitness, they're buying golf, they're buying every category: athletic apparel, footwear.  \n Regarding footwear, do you want to take that one, Ed? \nEdward Stack: It doesn't matter. I mean, from a footwear standpoint, we're really pleased with what's going on in footwear. We are not going to talk too much in a granular level from a competitive standpoint, but the AURs in footwear have definitely gone up. That's a combination of some allocation of shoes that we have as we've transitioned our footwear department to a premium full-serve department to what's happening from a running standpoint in running shoes at higher price points and, again, from people wanting to be in better shape. And that doesn't mean that they have to run a marathon or a 10K, but just people getting out to run a couple miles a day or get out and walk, the running shoe silhouette is the shoe of choice. And majority of those are well above $100 that we're selling, and it's helped increase the AUR, and we think that will continue. \nOperator: The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Lauren, congrats on the promotion. And Ed, congrats on a great run. \nEdward Stack: Thank you. \nJohn Kernan: Real quickly on eCommerce. On reasonable assumptions, the business is going to be pushing $2.8 billion to maybe $3 billion on an annual run rate by the end of the year. Just could you walk us through the margin improvement you're now seeing in digital. Obviously, curbside is playing a role in that. I think historically eCommerce had been a negative mix shift on the overall margin structure. It sounds like given the leverage it's producing now, it's a real driver of margin. So any commentary you can give us on how we should think about the digital mix shift on the margin profile of the business would be helpful. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. The margins in eCommerce channel is improving significantly when you look at it versus LY. Some of that is gross margin improvements, as we said, just the reduction in needing to be promotional. Some of it is the shift to the curbside channel, which has been -- which is permanent and great shift in terms of consumer benefit and then also cost structure. And some of it is just leverage of the investments that we've made over the years that were -- frankly, some of the reason we took the eCommerce platform in-house was so that we could scale more profitably, and so we're seeing the benefits of that as well.\n In-store versus eComm, there'll always be a slightly different profitability. You've got fixed costs in one and it's a variable cost in the other. But net-net, we're really pleased with the profitability of the eComm channel. We have been for some time, and this year has been standout. \nJohn Kernan: Excellent. That's helpful. Maybe a bit of a follow-up question to Paul's question, just the relationship with Nike. Clearly, we can see improved allocations, both in apparel and footwear, that really began last year and have continued into this year. You called out private brands and the success you're having there. But can you maybe just add a few comments on your relationship with Nike and where that can go going forward as they reduce their undifferentiated retail exposure? \nEdward Stack: I think our relations with Nike is great. It's been great. We've done business with Nike since the early '70s. The relationship continues to get better. I think that we find common ground where we can provide a platform for Nike to showcase their entire brand, which there's not a lot of retailers that are able to do that. They've got the hottest brand in the marketplace right now. We've gotten -- we're pleased with the allocations that we've been getting from them. And I think if you talk to Nike and you talk to us, the relationship has probably never been in a better position. \nOperator: The next question will come from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Congratulations to the both of you. My first question is on the gross margin as well. Typically, the private label, what sort of margin rate is that relative to the corporate average? And I would have thought, given the strength in some of these hardgoods categories, that maybe mix would have been a headwind to your business overall. And was it just that the private label actually at least offset that? It seems like perhaps it more than offset the hardgoods mix headwind. \nEdward Stack: The difference in margin rate in private brand is we try to keep at least 600 to 800 basis points. In some cases, it's even higher than that. So that certainly has helped the mix. \n And I think the one thing The Street doesn't understand about our business, every once in a while when we're in a conference when we can actually be face to face, which seems like 100 years ago that we were able to do that, one of the things that I get asked every once in a while, what does The Street not understand about your business? And one of the things I don't think that they understand is that the hardline side of our business is really quite profitable. The margin rates in golf have moved up quite a bit. Team Sports is good. The fitness business is good. The hunt business was not, and we're exiting that. And I just don't think that The Street really understands how profitable the hardline side of our business is. So in some cases, as the hardline business has escalated, it's actually helped our margin rates in some categories. So we're very pleased with our hardlines business. And so I'd like to go on record to let everybody know that our hardlines is really pretty profitable. \nChristopher Horvers: Right. And then you add the private label, which you get that advantage. So the mix overall is probably -- was the good guy in there. \nEdward Stack: It is. Yes. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then I guess you talked about being very strong quarter-to-date, some weather headwinds. I guess to what extent do you think starting Black Friday earlier maybe mitigated some of that headwind. And as you think about 4Q, what's your latest thought process around as you get into these like, later in December I would love to be playing golf in New York late in December, probably not going to happen. As some of those outdoor categories get mitigated in parts of the country, would you expect your overall comp to decelerate from the past 2-quarter level? \nEdward Stack: So we're not going to get into providing any of that guidance. But first of all, I'd like to say I hope you're not playing golf in New York in December. I hope you're skiing instead. But as we take a look at this, I think every retailer tried to pull sales forward in October and November, so even before this quarter started, because of what was the uncertainty around that Black Friday weekend. So many retailers have made the decision not to open on Thanksgiving, which I think is great. And my hope would be that retail -- all retailers decide, you know what, we actually got through this year. We don't need to open on Thanksgiving. We can allow our -- all of our teammates to spend Thanksgiving at home with their families, and we can open up early on Friday morning and kind of get back to it. But hopefully we can keep Thanksgiving as a family holiday.\n But what's going to happen after this? We really don't know, and I don't think any retailer does. We have a nice cushion. As we said, we're -- through this last weekend, we're in the high teens from a comp standpoint. So we've got some cushion for what's going to happen this weekend, but we clearly don't know. \n We're pretty optimistic once we get past this weekend of where we are. We've gotten in more exercise equipment. We're pleased with where we are from an apparel standpoint. The golf business continues to do well. Even if you're not playing golf in December, I think golf is going to be a great gift item for this holiday season.\n So all in all, we remain as optimistic as one should be in such an uncertain environment. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory. \nJoseph Feldman: Again, congratulations, Ed and Lauren, on the new roles. Wanted to ask, you did talk a little bit about data science earlier in the call, and I was just wondering kind of where things stand with that, like in terms of how big a team you have or what kind of team you have. Do you have any needs or areas you want to grow in that area? And how you're starting to leverage the data better to communicate with customers and what kind of opportunity that is for the future. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We do believe that data science is a huge unlock. It's a huge unlock for every retailer, but we have such large data in our data set between having 22 million ScoreCard members and 70% of our sales going through our ScoreCard database. So -- and we also have our GameChanger system, which has a ton of Team Sports information, which is now merged in the back-end so that we can look at the athlete holistically. We have a ton of insights that we get out of it. It is a driver of our entire marketing engine, our personalized marketing engine. It drives our digital buys. It drives how we find lookalike customers. And we have a small but mighty data science team. If you know of any people, you can throw them our way, we'd be happy to keep building the data science team, but this is an enormous strategic initiative for us. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. That's helpful. And then I have another question. Given the way digital has really been ramping, just broadly across retail, has that changed how you guys are thinking about the store? I know you have the store-of-the-future format kind of in place. But are you rethinking what the right size of the store might be, the format of it? Do you even need as many stores in some markets given the way eCommerce is playing out? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I'll take that one. We do -- so I think, if anything, the digital explosion has shown us, especially over the past year, is that our stores are an enormous asset, a huge, huge strength. I mean we've got 70% of our eComm sales flowing through the store. It enables us to open up inventory to the athlete in a 1- to 2-day perimeter around their house. It enables them to pick up curbside. We're probably one of the few retailers out there that -- we feel constrained by the size of our box. We are -- the hunt redeployment has opened up opportunities where we think we have growth areas that we've been underserving, that we have opportunities to grow.  So, sure we have real estate opportunities. And, sure we're going to continue to optimize, and we will continue to get reductions in the marketplace when leases come up and rethink our real estate strategy. But overall, the stores have become a bigger and bigger piece of our omni-channel pie this year more than ever. \nOperator: The next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I wonder -- I suspect not but I wonder if you can quantify the drag from Team Sports, understanding that it has been a net negative this year. Any color on how big Team Sports usually is versus how big it is this year. Just trying to get a sense of how big of an opportunity that could be next year. \nEdward Stack: Well, we're not going to get to that granular level, but it's been a drag. But the one thing about our business that we're really proud of that we've built is we've got this portfolio of categories that we can weather these ups and downs, and I think we've shown that pretty well here. And I think next year we'll have some categories that won't perform quite as well as they have this year, and we think Team Sports will be one of those areas that should be able to help offset that. Not only Team Sports, just from a hardgoods standpoint, but also on the footwear side of that, from a soccer cleat, football cleat, lacrosse, wrestling, all of that. As Team Sports or sports in general kind of come back to the junior high school, high school and municipal level, we think that there's a -- we've got some pent-up demand there that we think will help us next year. \nMichael Baker: Yes. Agreed. Definitely, pent-up demand in this family. One more question, if I could. Are you seeing anything different in your business in areas where COVID is sort of re-spiking? Any discernible trends in areas where we're seeing bigger COVID costs or just in general throughout the country, anything? As COVID comes back, are you seeing people stay home even more than they were and participate in outdoor sports? \nLauren Hobart: I think in the recent couple of weeks, the whole country is spiking and surging, so it's no longer productive to kind of look at those trends. Everybody is reacting to the current environment, and we haven't noticed a significant regional difference or geographic difference. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. \nSamuel Poser: Congratulations, Lauren and Ed, as well. Just real quick. Lauren, you talked about a lot of the new customer acquisitions that you've had. How -- what are you doing to make sure that they stick next year? And how many customers, new ones, have you seen repeat purchase already? Like what percentage are you seeing them come back once they've engaged DICK'S Sporting Goods? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We have an absolute dedicated strategy on trying to get reengagement, and we do see -- I'm not going to give the specifics, but we do see people reengaging. New customers are reengaging. We see that even more so with the curbside athletes, the people who are new to the system there. So we are very, very pleased with how the new customers are doing, and we'll be very focused on bringing them and keeping them into the ecosystem. \nSamuel Poser: And then secondly given the outdoor, the way people are moving outdoors for a lot of things, we've heard that you may have a new concept coming in the middle of next year, a real outdoor concept. Can you give us any color there as to what might be going on? \nEdward Stack: Yes. Sure, Sam. We've been working on this for a couple of years. And as we look to exit out of the Field & Stream business and the firearm business, one of the places where we think there's a great opportunity is the outdoors. And we've been working on this even prior to COVID.  And now with what's happened with the virus, I think it's even more timely, if you will.\n We're going to have a couple of stores. As you know, we always test new things. We think this is really a big concept, an outdoor concept called Public Lands that we will be opening 2 stores in this next year, one in probably August, another in October. One of them here in Pittsburgh that will take over a Field & Stream store. Another one in Columbus, Ohio, that will take over another Field & Stream store. And we think this is going to be a terrific concept. \n It's going to be very -- as we normally do in all of our business, it's going to be very cause-based. In the DICK'S business, we've been very cause-based around our Sports Matter Foundation and how important we think it is that kids have an opportunity to get out and play. And the character development for kids from sports and the investment we've made in Sports Matter over the years is -- we think it's -- we've touched over 1 million kids and have given them the opportunity to continue to play sports. We hope that we're going to be able to impact another 1 million over the next several years.\n And in Public Lands, we're going to focus on exactly what the name of the concept is, which is Public Lands. We think it's important to protect our public lands, to protect the environment, and this concept will really be focused on that. We think there's a real opportunity for people getting outdoors, camp, hike, bike, kayaking, fishing. It will be different than what you would see with REI and carve out a different niche, but we're really excited about this. The research we've done about this, we think there's a real opportunity in the marketplace. \n And it will -- this will help us, from real estate that we already own that has the Field & Stream concept in it, and we'll be able to very seamlessly change this by taking out the hunt department and modifying a couple of other departments, but it's real estate that we own. The architecture of -- that we have from a Field & Stream standpoint works very well with this outdoor concept. And we couldn't be more excited about it, and we'll be happy to provide some more detail when we get it opened early next fall, the 2 stores. But we think that there's a real opportunity here for a real growth vehicle. \nSamuel Poser: And just a real quick follow-up. Is that going to be -- I mean from what I've heard, this is maybe a little more elevated in the outdoor categories or at least portions of the outdoor categories than the outdoor categories within DICK'S Sporting Goods. Is that inaccurate? \nEdward Stack: Very much so, Sam. It will be very different than what we do with DICK'S today. So DICK'S from an outdoor category, our camping category, is we're really a bit more backyard camping, if you will, kind of day camping. This will be much more elevated. We think that the overlap between the products that we carry in this new concept and the products we carry in DICK'S will be somewhere around 20%, maybe a little bit less. But this will be more elevated equipment, apparel, footwear, at elevated price points with elevated brands, elevated service. We think this -- we're pretty excited about this. And this is one of the things that I'm going to be focusing the majority of my time in the new role is to help spearhead and lead this concept and really grow this into a real growth vehicle. \nOperator: The next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli, guys. I guess I had another follow-up on the private brands. Is the outperformance you're seeing coming more at the store level? Or is it more from the eCommerce channel or similar to both -- at both? \n And related to that, has the improvement coincided with greater marketing efforts on your part? Or has it been more of a function of pull from the customer? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Both in-store and online are doing really well with private brands. And I think it's certainly dedicated marketing, but it's also the product's really surprising and delighting. So in the case of our DSG brand, people have found it sometimes in the store. It was a white space opportunity. It was for an opening price point, high-value, high-fashion product. And so that one is really driven more by trial and just people -- and the product being so excellent. So it's a combination of all, but we are very, very dedicated to keeping -- keep driving the private -- I'm sorry, vertical brands. We've been bad at using that new term, vertical brand business. \nScot Ciccarelli: But Lauren, has anything been deemphasized as you try and put a greater emphasis on the vertical brands? \nLauren Hobart: Well -- I may have misunderstood your question, but I was thinking that Field & Stream vertical brand, within the vertical brands, has been deemphasized. But no, we view the -- this is not a trade-off. This is 1 plus 1 equals 3. \nOperator: The next question is from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo. \nTom Nikic: Let me add to the congratulations for Lauren and Ed. I want to follow up on some of the questions earlier about real estate and your stores. I think it kind of seems like one of the big messages that you're putting forth today is the importance of your stores and how important it is for -- even for fulfilling digital demand. I would imagine that maybe there landlords would be looking for strong concept, strong brand, strong retailers to potentially take up some space. So would you kind of view that as an opportunity to maybe reaccelerate store growth after you had sort of pumped the brakes a little bit pre-COVID? \nLee Belitsky: So we're certainly looking at those opportunities that are out in the marketplace right now, but I wouldn't expect there to be a rapid acceleration in our store growth. It gives us a lot of opportunity to reposition stores, to achieve lower rents. And there are certain markets out there right now and trade areas that are important that -- where we don't have a presence right now that I think it is important to us to get into those markets, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful acceleration in store growth. \nTom Nikic: Understood. And one quick follow-up. Obviously, you have a very clean balance sheet, lot of cash, good free cash flow. At what point do we think about share buyback coming back into the equation? \nEdward Stack: That's something we talk about from time to time obviously. And we bought back an awful lot of shares over the last several years. But to be honest with you, Tom, right now, we think that with such an uncertain environment and who knows what's going to happen from a COVID standpoint and whether there's going to be additional lockdown, so right now we think that cash is really important. And we're -- I wouldn't expect to see much from a share buyback standpoint right now. I think it's just too uncertain of an environment. But as we -- we always keep the idea open and if we think we can be opportunistic, we'll do that. But I think right now to be a little bit more conservative is the appropriate play. \nOperator: And the last question will be from Chris Svezia with Wedbush. \nChristopher Svezia: Congratulations to you both as well.  I guess, first, just on the -- I just want to go back to the outdoor, cold-weather categories, just a point of clarification. Have they -- are they still comping positive or they actually turn negative? In other words, they just underperform the overall company average or they actually turn negative, reference to your comments about the weather and cold-weather category? \nEdward Stack: Well, we're not going to get to that granular -- to that level of granularity right now. And the quarter is only 3 weeks and 2 days old. So we're just saying that in the beginning it was a bit of a headwind. The weather has gotten better -- gotten colder. So the trajectory has changed. But there's just so much time left in this quarter going into the holiday season, and we hope it gets cold. But if it doesn't, we've got our inventory planned in such a way that we're really not concerned about big markdowns or inventory issues if it doesn't get cold.\n And again, from our portfolio standpoint, if it doesn't get cold, then, as we said earlier, if they're playing golf in New York in December, our golf business will be really good. And how good the golf business is right now will offset a lot of the cold-weather merchandise. And if it gets cold, the cold-weather merchandise, we suspect, will be really very good. And golf, we think, will be a very good holiday gift item this year, more so than in the past.\n Overall, as I said before, we are as optimistic about our business as we think one should be in this somewhat uncertain environment. But looking forward into next year and the year after, we are very, very excited about our business and -- which is one of the reasons why that I think this was the perfect time to make this transition from me as the CEO to Lauren as the CEO. It's always good to do these things when you've got positive momentum. And we've got positive momentum, and we see that momentum into the future also. \nChristopher Svezia: Got it. I wanted to just ask, for Lee, for you, on the merchandise margin. Past 2 quarters have been quite impressive. Maybe if you can break out between what's partially driven by supply constraints leading to somewhat less promotional activity, the curbside pickup that's enhanced eComm and just mix, the private brand growth. Is there any way just to separate if you're -- if you can just rank them in terms of what's been the biggest driver on that front? \nEdward Stack: There's really not a silver bullet. There's -- it's a combination of -- as you said, it's a combination of mix. It's a combination of fewer promotions. It's a combination of our private brand. It's a combination of digital moving to curbside or stores moving to curbside. There's a lot of puts and takes in this. And as I said, we really -- we think we're in a great lane right now. We think that we've got upside from a margin rate, as Lee said earlier. And overall, we are pretty optimistic about our business. \nChristopher Svezia: Okay. And just a final thing. What do you think from a planning perspective for 2021? I mean -- and just given what you saw in 2020, looking at both sales and just the operating expense and just merchants and inventory, it looks like you're looking at possibly a hybrid from a planning process because you get some obviously favorable comparisons, Q1 because of COVID, and then obviously you have the more tougher comparisons from thereafter. So I guess I'm just trying to understand as we all try to think about 2021, is it fair to say there isn't one single way to look at this? We should be looking at both planning from 2019 and 2020. Or maybe any color about how you would think about it internally, how your teams are thinking about first half, second half from a planning perspective. And what's the baseline? \nLee Belitsky: So we're building off of 2019 because 2020 has been so volatile with very, very tough first quarter, when we were closed, and then we had surges of business in Q2 and Q3. So we're building it off of 2019. We're optimistic that we can make some meaningful improvements in the business versus 2019, both on the sales margin -- sales and margin side, but we're not ready to give guidance on 2021 at this point. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ed Stack for any closing remarks. \nEdward Stack: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our quarterly call and look forward to -- Lauren and Lee will look forward to speaking with everybody on the next quarterly call. And I can promise you you're all in good hands with Lauren at the helm. So thank you very much. Everybody have a great holiday. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to discuss the executive transition we announced this morning.  \n As of February 1, 2021, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman while continuing my responsibilities as Chief Merchant. I'll also oversee the strategic growth initiatives for the company.  As I make this transition, I want everyone to know, as the largest and controlling shareholder of DICK'S Sporting Goods, I remain as committed and as excited about this business as I have ever been.  \n The Board unanimously elected Lauren as President and CEO of DICK'S, also effective February 1. Lauren brings more than 25 years of finance, consumer and retail experience, having spent 5 years in banking and 14 years at PepsiCo in various leadership roles before joining us nearly a decade ago as our Chief Marketing Officer. She was appointed President in 2017 and joined the Board the following year. Since joining the company, Lauren has been instrumental to our growth and success, revamping our marketing efforts, helping drive our robust omni-channel offering and elevating our athletes' experience. Lauren's appointment is an important step in the Succession Planning Committee's process to put the right leadership in place. Our business is thriving. We have the best management team in the company's history, making this the perfect time for the transition.\n I'd now like to turn it over to Lauren for a few words. Thanks, Lauren. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter from both a sales and profitability perspective. The strength of our diverse category portfolio once again helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand as the trends across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle continued throughout the third quarter.  \n Our Q3 consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 23.2% and was on top of our 6% comp increase in the same period last year. Our stores were the key to this unprecedented growth and serve as the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel experience. Brick-and-mortar stores comps grew double digits, and our stores fulfilled 70% of our online sales, which increased nearly 100% for the quarter. In fact, our stores drove 90% of our total Q3 sales growth, whether an athlete purchased at the register, picked up curbside or had their order delivered to their home through ship-from-store.  We saw increases in both average ticket and transactions as well as significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.  \n Lastly, our private brands continue to be a significant source of strength with comps outperforming the company average by over 1,000 basis points. I'll talk a little more about private brands later.  \n During Q3, we remained very disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace remained supply-constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 277 basis points. This merchandise margin expansion contributed to a significant improvement in gross margin, which increased 532 basis points. In total, our third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 represented a 287% increase over last year.  \n Now let me touch on the fourth quarter performance to date. Overall, the favorable trends in our business have continued into Q4. These strong results have been partially offset by warmer weather that has negatively impacted sales in the important cold-weather categories. Taken together, through this past weekend, our comp sales have increased in the high teens.\n As I look at our business, we have a lot to be excited about. One of the strategies I'm most enthusiastic about is our private brand strategy, which we now refer to as our vertical brands. There can be a perception that private brand or private label means opening price point. In contrast, our vertical brands are high-quality on-trend brands with compelling technical and performance attributes. These vertical brands have clear DNA and specific consumer targets for which we control everything, including design, supply chain and marketing.\n We've already done some great things to date. In just 5 years CALIA, which services the trend-right athletic female at premium price points, has become the second-largest women's brand in our company. Our DSG brand, which spans men's, women's and youth athletic apparel, as well as hardlines categories, has also been extremely successful and has grown to become our largest vertical brand just 1 year following its launch. Collectively, our vertical golf equipment and apparel brands represent our #1 brand in golf, while Fitness Gear is our single largest fitness brand.  \n Looking ahead, we will invest in making our vertical brands even stronger. This includes improved space in store, increased marketing and expanding into additional product categories. At the same time, we will also continue to invest in our strategic partnerships with key national brands such as Nike, Callaway and The North Face. We recognize that these important brands are real differentiating factors that create authenticity and credibility with our athletes.\n As I discussed on the last quarter's call, we're really in a great lane right now. We deliver a premium, multi-branded assortment that is well tailored to the consumer trends. We have an industry-leading omni-channel experience with rapidly growing and a highly profitable eCommerce business. And importantly, we are in a strong financial position with nearly $1.1 billion in cash.\n Before concluding, I want to address something incredibly important to our country, our company, and to me personally. The recent racial injustices across our nation led us and many companies to take an honest and critical look inside our organization. We realized we had work to do and committed to make DICK'S be a more inclusive and diverse company. This change started at the top. And over the past several months, we brought a much-needed diverse perspective to our Board of Directors.  \n Furthermore, our Inclusion and Diversity Council, which was launched last year and is comprised of a group of teammates who represent a wide range of backgrounds, roles and communities, established nearly 20 impact teams to accelerate our efforts. We have already delivered meaningful progress in several areas, including adopting a new recruitment and talent development process to build a more diverse workforce and expanding inclusivity training across our entire organization. Earlier this month, we published this year's Purpose Playbook, where you can read more about our efforts to drive positive change in our communities and our world. Separately, we announced our investment in the Black Economic Development Fund, which supports black-owned banks and financing for minority businesses, charter schools, affordable housing and athletic facilities.\n Today, as we talk about another strong quarter as a team, I cannot be more pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. And I want to thank all of our 45,000 teammates, especially our frontline workers in our stores and distribution centers, for their hard work and unwavering dedication to safely serving our athletes. As the retail industry continues to evolve, DICK'S will continue to lead the way, and I look forward to working with Lauren and the entire team to build our success and deliver sustained value to our shareholders.  \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Lauren. Thank you. Sure. Thanks, Robby. I don't think it's pent-up demand any longer. I think in the second quarter there was probably some pent-up demand. But now I just think it's a transformation of what people are doing and what they want to do to not only be safe, be in better physical condition, from what's happening in our running business, our athletic apparel business, the fitness business, but also the fact that they want to get outdoors and do things and they want to feel safe. And being outdoors is talked about one of the safest places to be. So people are playing golf. They're running. They're kayaking. They're doing all of those things.  \n And I do think that going into next year, we remain pretty optimistic because as some people have come back into some of these activities or have taken them up for the first time, they've realized they really enjoy this. They may have done it because they had nothing else to do, but they've gotten to the point where they've really realized that they like golf or they like golf again or they like to be out hiking with their families. So we think this is sustainable.  \n And as we take a look at next year, our Team Sports business is not good right now. Certain categories are a little bit better than others. Baseball is pretty good, but other ones have been difficult. And we do think that the Team Sports business, there will be quite a bit of pent-up demand next year that will help us offset some of the tough comps that we're going to have this year.\n We're not providing guidance into next year, I think it's really too early to tell, but we think we're in a very good lane. I think that how people view their lifestyle is not going to meaningfully change next year. They're still going to want to be outside. They're still going to want to be active. They're still going to want to play golf. I think the work-from-home change is good for our business from the fact of the clothes that people are buying. And I don't believe next year we're going to be fully back to being in an office from 9 to 5, 5 days a week. I don't know if we're ever going to go and do that. I know in our company we're talking about what we think the office environment will look like going forward. And quite frankly, we don't see it 5 days a week going forward.\n So we're in a pretty good lane. We're pretty enthusiastic. The changes that we've made in our business from an online standpoint, the technology investments that we've made over the last several years have really started to pay off. We got a little bit lucky with the timing. We said that they were starting to pay off and we're starting to see those, and then COVID hit. And that online component, that digital component of our business was so very important, and we are so pleased that we made those investments a few years ago. So Robby, we're as optimistic as we can be about not only our business going forward the balance of this year but into next year also. Yes, Simeon. I think it will be higher for a couple of reasons. As Lee said, I don't think we're going to get really that promotional as we were in '19. I think there's also a couple of other things that are working in our favor, which is mix. So the firearms business and the hunt business will be meaningfully less for us in 2021 than it was in 2020 -- or in 2019, and that mix will help our margins. The private brands will help our margins. The way that we've differentiated product that we buy in the marketplace from our key brands will help that mix. So we are anticipating that the merchandise gross margin level will be better in '21 than it was in '19. I think that it's definitely going to be -- as a percent, I think we can make some positive changes there. Because as Lauren said, the curbside pickup, what -- we've started to see that what started out as a service from a public health standpoint has now migrated to be a convenience standpoint for the athletes that we serve. And we've gotten so many really positive comments about how Lauren and the team and Don and his team in the stores have executed this. We think that's going to continue to be a bigger part of our business, which will help leverage the costs from an eCommerce standpoint, a digital standpoint. They have continued, and we expect them to continue. As I said before, I think people realize that the best way to stay healthy is to be in better shape. And riding a bike, working on a treadmill or dumbbells I think is something that's here to stay for some time into the future because people do realize that to get through this pandemic and whether -- other health crisis they may have personally or we may have in the world, that we just need to be in better shape. And I think people have -- that lifestyle, if you will, is not going to change anytime soon. It doesn't matter. I mean, from a footwear standpoint, we're really pleased with what's going on in footwear. We are not going to talk too much in a granular level from a competitive standpoint, but the AURs in footwear have definitely gone up. That's a combination of some allocation of shoes that we have as we've transitioned our footwear department to a premium full-serve department to what's happening from a running standpoint in running shoes at higher price points and, again, from people wanting to be in better shape. And that doesn't mean that they have to run a marathon or a 10K, but just people getting out to run a couple miles a day or get out and walk, the running shoe silhouette is the shoe of choice. And majority of those are well above $100 that we're selling, and it's helped increase the AUR, and we think that will continue. Thank you. I think our relations with Nike is great. It's been great. We've done business with Nike since the early '70s. The relationship continues to get better. I think that we find common ground where we can provide a platform for Nike to showcase their entire brand, which there's not a lot of retailers that are able to do that. They've got the hottest brand in the marketplace right now. We've gotten -- we're pleased with the allocations that we've been getting from them. And I think if you talk to Nike and you talk to us, the relationship has probably never been in a better position. The difference in margin rate in private brand is we try to keep at least 600 to 800 basis points. In some cases, it's even higher than that. So that certainly has helped the mix. \n And I think the one thing The Street doesn't understand about our business, every once in a while when we're in a conference when we can actually be face to face, which seems like 100 years ago that we were able to do that, one of the things that I get asked every once in a while, what does The Street not understand about your business? And one of the things I don't think that they understand is that the hardline side of our business is really quite profitable. The margin rates in golf have moved up quite a bit. Team Sports is good. The fitness business is good. The hunt business was not, and we're exiting that. And I just don't think that The Street really understands how profitable the hardline side of our business is. So in some cases, as the hardline business has escalated, it's actually helped our margin rates in some categories. So we're very pleased with our hardlines business. And so I'd like to go on record to let everybody know that our hardlines is really pretty profitable. It is. Yes. So we're not going to get into providing any of that guidance. But first of all, I'd like to say I hope you're not playing golf in New York in December. I hope you're skiing instead. But as we take a look at this, I think every retailer tried to pull sales forward in October and November, so even before this quarter started, because of what was the uncertainty around that Black Friday weekend. So many retailers have made the decision not to open on Thanksgiving, which I think is great. And my hope would be that retail -- all retailers decide, you know what, we actually got through this year. We don't need to open on Thanksgiving. We can allow our -- all of our teammates to spend Thanksgiving at home with their families, and we can open up early on Friday morning and kind of get back to it. But hopefully we can keep Thanksgiving as a family holiday.\n But what's going to happen after this? We really don't know, and I don't think any retailer does. We have a nice cushion. As we said, we're -- through this last weekend, we're in the high teens from a comp standpoint. So we've got some cushion for what's going to happen this weekend, but we clearly don't know. \n We're pretty optimistic once we get past this weekend of where we are. We've gotten in more exercise equipment. We're pleased with where we are from an apparel standpoint. The golf business continues to do well. Even if you're not playing golf in December, I think golf is going to be a great gift item for this holiday season.\n So all in all, we remain as optimistic as one should be in such an uncertain environment. Well, we're not going to get to that granular level, but it's been a drag. But the one thing about our business that we're really proud of that we've built is we've got this portfolio of categories that we can weather these ups and downs, and I think we've shown that pretty well here. And I think next year we'll have some categories that won't perform quite as well as they have this year, and we think Team Sports will be one of those areas that should be able to help offset that. Not only Team Sports, just from a hardgoods standpoint, but also on the footwear side of that, from a soccer cleat, football cleat, lacrosse, wrestling, all of that. As Team Sports or sports in general kind of come back to the junior high school, high school and municipal level, we think that there's a -- we've got some pent-up demand there that we think will help us next year. Yes. Sure, Sam. We've been working on this for a couple of years. And as we look to exit out of the Field & Stream business and the firearm business, one of the places where we think there's a great opportunity is the outdoors. And we've been working on this even prior to COVID.  And now with what's happened with the virus, I think it's even more timely, if you will.\n We're going to have a couple of stores. As you know, we always test new things. We think this is really a big concept, an outdoor concept called Public Lands that we will be opening 2 stores in this next year, one in probably August, another in October. One of them here in Pittsburgh that will take over a Field & Stream store. Another one in Columbus, Ohio, that will take over another Field & Stream store. And we think this is going to be a terrific concept. \n It's going to be very -- as we normally do in all of our business, it's going to be very cause-based. In the DICK'S business, we've been very cause-based around our Sports Matter Foundation and how important we think it is that kids have an opportunity to get out and play. And the character development for kids from sports and the investment we've made in Sports Matter over the years is -- we think it's -- we've touched over 1 million kids and have given them the opportunity to continue to play sports. We hope that we're going to be able to impact another 1 million over the next several years.\n And in Public Lands, we're going to focus on exactly what the name of the concept is, which is Public Lands. We think it's important to protect our public lands, to protect the environment, and this concept will really be focused on that. We think there's a real opportunity for people getting outdoors, camp, hike, bike, kayaking, fishing. It will be different than what you would see with REI and carve out a different niche, but we're really excited about this. The research we've done about this, we think there's a real opportunity in the marketplace. \n And it will -- this will help us, from real estate that we already own that has the Field & Stream concept in it, and we'll be able to very seamlessly change this by taking out the hunt department and modifying a couple of other departments, but it's real estate that we own. The architecture of -- that we have from a Field & Stream standpoint works very well with this outdoor concept. And we couldn't be more excited about it, and we'll be happy to provide some more detail when we get it opened early next fall, the 2 stores. But we think that there's a real opportunity here for a real growth vehicle. Very much so, Sam. It will be very different than what we do with DICK'S today. So DICK'S from an outdoor category, our camping category, is we're really a bit more backyard camping, if you will, kind of day camping. This will be much more elevated. We think that the overlap between the products that we carry in this new concept and the products we carry in DICK'S will be somewhere around 20%, maybe a little bit less. But this will be more elevated equipment, apparel, footwear, at elevated price points with elevated brands, elevated service. We think this -- we're pretty excited about this. And this is one of the things that I'm going to be focusing the majority of my time in the new role is to help spearhead and lead this concept and really grow this into a real growth vehicle. That's something we talk about from time to time obviously. And we bought back an awful lot of shares over the last several years. But to be honest with you, Tom, right now, we think that with such an uncertain environment and who knows what's going to happen from a COVID standpoint and whether there's going to be additional lockdown, so right now we think that cash is really important. And we're -- I wouldn't expect to see much from a share buyback standpoint right now. I think it's just too uncertain of an environment. But as we -- we always keep the idea open and if we think we can be opportunistic, we'll do that. But I think right now to be a little bit more conservative is the appropriate play. Well, we're not going to get to that granular -- to that level of granularity right now. And the quarter is only 3 weeks and 2 days old. So we're just saying that in the beginning it was a bit of a headwind. The weather has gotten better -- gotten colder. So the trajectory has changed. But there's just so much time left in this quarter going into the holiday season, and we hope it gets cold. But if it doesn't, we've got our inventory planned in such a way that we're really not concerned about big markdowns or inventory issues if it doesn't get cold.\n And again, from our portfolio standpoint, if it doesn't get cold, then, as we said earlier, if they're playing golf in New York in December, our golf business will be really good. And how good the golf business is right now will offset a lot of the cold-weather merchandise. And if it gets cold, the cold-weather merchandise, we suspect, will be really very good. And golf, we think, will be a very good holiday gift item this year, more so than in the past.\n Overall, as I said before, we are as optimistic about our business as we think one should be in this somewhat uncertain environment. But looking forward into next year and the year after, we are very, very excited about our business and -- which is one of the reasons why that I think this was the perfect time to make this transition from me as the CEO to Lauren as the CEO. It's always good to do these things when you've got positive momentum. And we've got positive momentum, and we see that momentum into the future also. There's really not a silver bullet. There's -- it's a combination of -- as you said, it's a combination of mix. It's a combination of fewer promotions. It's a combination of our private brand. It's a combination of digital moving to curbside or stores moving to curbside. There's a lot of puts and takes in this. And as I said, we really -- we think we're in a great lane right now. We think that we've got upside from a margin rate, as Lee said earlier. And overall, we are pretty optimistic about our business. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our quarterly call and look forward to -- Lauren and Lee will look forward to speaking with everybody on the next quarterly call. And I can promise you you're all in good hands with Lauren at the helm. So thank you very much. Everybody have a great holiday."

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by extending a heartfelt thank you to Ed. He built this company from the ground up, and it is because of his ability to look around corners, innovate, take risks, and develop and nurture talent, all while never losing sight of our values and making sure that we're a good member of our communities, that DICK'S is what it is today. It is truly an honor working alongside him.\n I also want to thank our Board and our teammates. I look forward to continuing to work with them, the rest of the extended DICK'S family and all of you in the coming months and years ahead. Under Ed's leadership, we've accomplished so much, fostering a stronger and more inclusive culture and developing a powerful omni-channel experience for our athletes. We're in great shape from both a financial and managerial standpoint, and I look forward to continuing to work with Ed to lead DICK'S into the next phase of its growth.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Ed to discuss the third quarter results. Thanks, Ed. I want to start also by thanking our teammates. They continue to serve our athletes and our communities safely, and their efforts helped us execute a seamless omni-channel experience and deliver a record-setting comp sales increase for Q3. I am so grateful to work alongside and support each of them.  \n Our third quarter performance reflected a strong, well-balanced omni-channel offering with both our stores and eCommerce delivering exceptional results. In fact, our brick-and-mortar store comps increased double digits, the best quarterly store comp performance in our history as a public company. Our online sales increased 95%, representing 21% of our total business compared to 13% in the third quarter of last year.\n Year-to-date, our eCommerce sales of over $1.8 billion have already surpassed our full year eCommerce sales in 2019, even with the holiday shopping season still ahead of us. Within eCommerce in the third quarter, mobile sales penetration was over 50%, and we saw a significant increase in mobile app downloads. Importantly, this incredible strength in our eCommerce business happened with all of our stores fully open throughout the quarter.\n Our stores are the hub of our omni-channel experience. They serve our in-store athletes while also providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. In the third quarter, even while facing exceptionally high levels of omni-channel demand, our stores fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales. This includes curbside and in-store pickup, which increased over 300% when compared to BOPIS sales last year. With curbside available at all of our stores, the service is widely accessible, and our athletes are responding well to the same-day convenience that it offers. In fact, in the third quarter, our curbside athletes shopped more frequently, transacting 20% more often than our non-curbside eCommerce athletes. We continue to make enhancements to the service, including the ability to do curbside returns, and we've got dedicated parking spaces at nearly all of our stores, along with improved way-finding and signage. While we initially launched curbside as a stopgap to provide a safe and contactless solution to our athletes as a result of COVID-19, it's become quite clear that it is a highly convenient way to shop that is here to stay.  \n Importantly, while our eCommerce business continues to be highly successful and penetration continues to increase, we also continue to improve the profitability of the channel, especially as stores play a larger role in fulfillment. In the third quarter, we saw significant improvement in eCommerce gross margins driven by higher penetration of curbside and BOPIS sales as well as fewer promotions and leverage of fixed costs.  \n Furthermore, we continue to make technology enhancements to provide an increasingly seamless omni-channel experience. In fact, as part of this year's holiday campaign, we're highlighting the technology and logistics systems in our supply chain in a unique and an engaging way. From a store perspective, we recently rolled out a contactless, self-checkout app called Scan, Pay, & Play to over 300 stores, which enables an efficient checkout solution for our athletes while also giving them the ability to quickly look up pricing information and product descriptions as they shop in our stores. We will continue to refine this technology and roll it out to additional stores in the near future.\n We also recently launched HOME PLATE, a mobile communications app that provides our store teammates with real-time metrics and important communications all while on the sales floor, giving them more time to focus on providing great service to athletes.  \n Another key to our omni-channel offering is our ScoreCard loyalty program, which provides robust data that we can leverage to increase engagement and drive traffic. With over 20 million active members, our ScoreCard loyalty program drives over 70% of total sales through more meaningful and effective personalized offers and communications. We value our ScoreCard loyalty members deeply. And with members spending approximately 30% more per transaction than nonmembers, retaining existing members and bringing new customers into the program is extremely important to us.\n Speaking of new customers, in the third quarter, nearly 2 million new customers joined the DICK'S Sporting Goods ecosystem, with sales from new customers increasing over 70% compared to last year. Relative to our existing customers, our new customers skew female and younger, representing a great opportunity for future growth.  \n In closing, as we continue to refine and enhance our industry-leading omni-channel experience, data science and technology have never been more important. They're the keys to creating a personalized one-to-one relationship with our athletes and serving them in the most convenient way possible. Looking to the fourth quarter, we're very enthusiastic about our business, and we look forward to serving athletes this holiday season.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. Thanks. Yes. I think when we last had our quarterly announcement, I think we were up 11% in the quarter, and we had been through a back-to-school that was a little delayed and Team Sports were slow. That did improve as the quarter went on. There was some delay in Team Sports and a delay, frankly, in some of the back-to-school categories that helped contribute to the strong growth. No. I think our platforms are very capable and have enabled us to innovate as much as we have, including spinning up the curbside so quickly and now the Scan, Pay, & Play app. We've improved our teammate efficiency with technology. We feel we're in a very good place from a technology platform and foundation standpoint. Great. Adrienne, I'll start off. So in terms of our inventory position at the end of Q3 coming into Q4, you're right, our inventory is clean, it's good. We are still chasing in several key categories. And if you were to ask whether we have left some sales on the table, it's likely that we have. But I do agree with you that our preferred-partner, strategic-partner status with some of our key vendors has enabled us to keep a steady supply chain coming through and is helping us with the tailwinds that we have already.\n As we go into spring, we're making all the reasonable bets that one would make, expecting certain key trends to continue, and in fact, some of the ones that started this year that we believe will continue on, things like golf, as well as some other fitness activities and then of course hoping for a strong return to school and Team Sports in the spring as well. Lee? Yes. Simeon, the more curbside certainly helps the gross margin line, and we saw that this quarter. The whole profitability of the channel, the eCommerce channel, has improved, and a lot of that's due to things like that as well as just leverage of some of our investments from the past. So we didn't mention it because it didn't have a material impact on the quarter due to some leverage that we had in the gross margin line. There were increased shipping expenses, obviously, due to the fact that eComm was up 95%. But net-net, it didn't have a material impact on the margin for the quarter. So for gross margin, we're not going to get into how we're planning Q4 other than to say we'll know a lot more in a week or 2 how Q4 is going to look. But we are quite confident and optimistic and happy with our quarter-to-date results that we shared on the call.  \n Cold weather is obviously important to us in the fall, in the winter. We often have said, I'll quote Ed on this one, that if we're playing golf in December, it's not great for the outerwear business. It is good for the golf business, however, which is great. But we have a good inventory position. We've got the product. We think people are going to want to be outside even more and need to be outside. So we don't perceive that we have a significant inventory risk there. With regard to the 2 million new customers, they do skew younger. They skew slightly more female. That's relative to our norm and just in those new customers. They also skew slightly more urban, which we think might have something to do with the urban -- people start leaving the urban centers and going out into the suburbs.  \n In terms of what are they buying, they're buying everything that has driven our comps this quarter. So it's exactly what we've been saying in terms of the surging categories, but they're buying fitness, they're buying golf, they're buying every category: athletic apparel, footwear.  \n Regarding footwear, do you want to take that one, Ed? Yes. The margins in eCommerce channel is improving significantly when you look at it versus LY. Some of that is gross margin improvements, as we said, just the reduction in needing to be promotional. Some of it is the shift to the curbside channel, which has been -- which is permanent and great shift in terms of consumer benefit and then also cost structure. And some of it is just leverage of the investments that we've made over the years that were -- frankly, some of the reason we took the eCommerce platform in-house was so that we could scale more profitably, and so we're seeing the benefits of that as well.\n In-store versus eComm, there'll always be a slightly different profitability. You've got fixed costs in one and it's a variable cost in the other. But net-net, we're really pleased with the profitability of the eComm channel. We have been for some time, and this year has been standout. Yes. We do believe that data science is a huge unlock. It's a huge unlock for every retailer, but we have such large data in our data set between having 22 million ScoreCard members and 70% of our sales going through our ScoreCard database. So -- and we also have our GameChanger system, which has a ton of Team Sports information, which is now merged in the back-end so that we can look at the athlete holistically. We have a ton of insights that we get out of it. It is a driver of our entire marketing engine, our personalized marketing engine. It drives our digital buys. It drives how we find lookalike customers. And we have a small but mighty data science team. If you know of any people, you can throw them our way, we'd be happy to keep building the data science team, but this is an enormous strategic initiative for us. Yes. I'll take that one. We do -- so I think, if anything, the digital explosion has shown us, especially over the past year, is that our stores are an enormous asset, a huge, huge strength. I mean we've got 70% of our eComm sales flowing through the store. It enables us to open up inventory to the athlete in a 1- to 2-day perimeter around their house. It enables them to pick up curbside. We're probably one of the few retailers out there that -- we feel constrained by the size of our box. We are -- the hunt redeployment has opened up opportunities where we think we have growth areas that we've been underserving, that we have opportunities to grow.  So, sure we have real estate opportunities. And, sure we're going to continue to optimize, and we will continue to get reductions in the marketplace when leases come up and rethink our real estate strategy. But overall, the stores have become a bigger and bigger piece of our omni-channel pie this year more than ever. I think in the recent couple of weeks, the whole country is spiking and surging, so it's no longer productive to kind of look at those trends. Everybody is reacting to the current environment, and we haven't noticed a significant regional difference or geographic difference. Yes. We have an absolute dedicated strategy on trying to get reengagement, and we do see -- I'm not going to give the specifics, but we do see people reengaging. New customers are reengaging. We see that even more so with the curbside athletes, the people who are new to the system there. So we are very, very pleased with how the new customers are doing, and we'll be very focused on bringing them and keeping them into the ecosystem. Yes. Both in-store and online are doing really well with private brands. And I think it's certainly dedicated marketing, but it's also the product's really surprising and delighting. So in the case of our DSG brand, people have found it sometimes in the store. It was a white space opportunity. It was for an opening price point, high-value, high-fashion product. And so that one is really driven more by trial and just people -- and the product being so excellent. So it's a combination of all, but we are very, very dedicated to keeping -- keep driving the private -- I'm sorry, vertical brands. We've been bad at using that new term, vertical brand business. Well -- I may have misunderstood your question, but I was thinking that Field & Stream vertical brand, within the vertical brands, has been deemphasized. But no, we view the -- this is not a trade-off. This is 1 plus 1 equals 3. Thank you."

            "name": "Lee Belitsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results.\n Consolidated sales increased 22.9% to approximately $2.41 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 23.2% driven by a 19.6% increase in average ticket and a 3.6% increase in transactions. Brick-and-mortar comps grew double digits. Our eCommerce sales increased 95%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 21% compared to 13% last year. And lastly, we delivered significant growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.\n Gross profit in the third quarter was $842.2 million or 34.91% of net sales, a 532 basis point improvement compared to last year. This improvement was driven primarily by merchandise margin rate expansion of 277 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 259 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions. Gross profit also included about $4 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $591.1 million or 24.51% of net sales and on a non-GAAP basis leveraged 174 basis points from last year. This leverage was primarily driven by our significant sales increase as well as strong expense control efforts. As expected, this was partially offset by $44 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.  \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, along with our disciplined expense management, non-GAAP EBT was $243.8 million or 10.11% of net sales and on a non-GAAP basis increased $183.8 million or 706 basis points from the same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 last year, a 287% year-over-year increase.\n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $1.84. This included $6.7 million of noncash interest expense as well as 6 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedge at settlement but required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to the convertible notes that were issued in Q1. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now I'll briefly review our 2020 year-to-date results. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May, consolidated same-store sales have increased 5.8%, and that was on top of our 3.1% comp increase in the first 39 weeks last year. Within this, our eCommerce sales have increased 135%. And as a percent of net sales, our online business increased to 28% compared to 13% last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.65. This included $124 million or $1.01 per diluted share of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs, and it compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.39 for the first 39 weeks last year, a 53% year-over-year increase.  \n Now moving to our balance sheet. As Ed stated, we are in a strong financial position, ending Q3 with nearly $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. \n Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 9.8% compared to the same period last year. Looking ahead, our inventory is clean, and we will continue to chase product to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand categories.\n Touching on our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $51 million, and we paid $26 million in quarterly dividends.\n With respect to our full year outlook, there's still high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of key external factors. Given this uncertainty, we will not be providing a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. We will continue to reassess the practicality of resuming guidance in future quarters. While mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we are extremely pleased with our significant Q3 results as well as our Q4 sales trends. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods.  \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open the line for questions. With regard to margin, we've seen some great improvement in our gross margin rates over the last couple of quarters. And as we look forward, reflecting on it a bit, I think that some of the items that will tend to be permanent will be leverage over some of our fixed fulfillment costs. We've built a couple of distribution centers for eComm fulfillment last year, and we've been able to leverage those costs, plus we didn't have -- we're past the start-up costs of those. Curbside pickup represents a big leverage point for us because we don't incur shipping expenses to ship products to customers. And to the extent that we've had significant adoption there, and that continues, which we believe it will, that represents permanent gross margin improvement. I believe that the growth of our private brands that we can continue to invest in have a higher gross margin profile than the national brand, so we're excited about that.  \n And we've also been able to pull back pretty meaningfully on site-wide promotions on our eCommerce site. We believe that some of that will be permanent going forward. It remains to be determined really as we get into next year and everybody gets back in stock, but it's our intention to really be much more cautious with site-wide promotions going forward.\n Some of the things are also temporary, it's hard to say. A lot of it's going to be around the promotional environment going forward. We have been able to be less promotional because there's been a lot of product shortages out there, and we haven't had to put product on sale. And frankly, we haven't owned enough product in a lot of categories to put it on sale and provide a great customer experience there. So that one, which is a big lever for us, is -- remains to be seen. We'll probably give some of that back as inventory levels normalize.\n Some of the leverage that we're getting over are fixed rent expenses. We continue to be able to bring down -- modestly bring down our rent expense each year through better leverage and negotiating our rent deals and rent renewals, and we expect that to be permanent as well. Some of that -- a lot of that leverage is driven by higher sales. So to the extent we can drive -- continue to drive higher sales going forward will create leverage over all of our fixed costs, both rent and our fixed distribution costs as well. I think for the most part, yes. With regard to promotions, I don't know that they'll go back to 2019 levels. I don't think we really know for certain. It will be our intention going into next year that we wouldn't return to 2019 levels, that we'd certainly start out the year being less promotional. And then we'll see how the year evolves from there. But it's -- we're not just going to pull out the 2019 promotional cadence and go back to that as we go into next year. Well, with regards to capital expenditures, we did defer a couple of initiatives into next year. One that we had planned on for this year was kind of the completion of space reallocation of 440 stores out of hunt and into other more productive categories. We completed 200 of those stores. We have about 240 to go that we've deferred into next year. So we'll get going on those as we get into the first quarter of next year. There are certain other in-store programs that we deferred to next year, some around technology in the golf space, around making some improvement in our premium full-service footwear decks and expanding those as well. So certain of those CapEx have been deferred into next year.\n I really don't want to comment right now on what our SG&A expense run rates are for next year as we're kind of still working through our budgeting process for next year, and we'll give you some more details on that as we get into the annual, the year-end call in March. Well, Michael, one of the things you have to think about is we have about I think it's $170 million of COVID expenses in there, which is impacting our operating margins nearly 200 basis points this year, and we didn't have that back then. So we still think that we can make some meaningful improvements in our operating margins going forward, and we're optimistic about having that opportunity, both in gross margin rates. As we continue to address our occupancy expenses and the changes that we've made in our merchandise assortments around hunting and private brands and working with our key vendors as they continue to narrow their distribution, it could reduce the pressure on promotions going forward. So we believe there is a lot of opportunity to increase our operating margins going forward. We're still working through that on how much it's going to carry into next year as COVID goes forward. Probably, there continues to be some pressure on wage rates in the stores. But -- and certain things that we've got like ambassadors, people standing at the front of the store, handing out masks and doing customer counts in and out of stores and cleaning expenses and things like that will go away. And some of the wage rate pressure that we've got this year around paying hero pay will go away. But wage rates continue to be under pressure going forward, and we still have to assess how that will be -- what impact that will have for next year. So we're certainly looking at those opportunities that are out in the marketplace right now, but I wouldn't expect there to be a rapid acceleration in our store growth. It gives us a lot of opportunity to reposition stores, to achieve lower rents. And there are certain markets out there right now and trade areas that are important that -- where we don't have a presence right now that I think it is important to us to get into those markets, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful acceleration in store growth. So we're building off of 2019 because 2020 has been so volatile with very, very tough first quarter, when we were closed, and then we had surges of business in Q2 and Q3. So we're building it off of 2019. We're optimistic that we can make some meaningful improvements in the business versus 2019, both on the sales margin -- sales and margin side, but we're not ready to give guidance on 2021 at this point."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.\n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on the Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. \n And finally, a couple of admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers.\n Furthermore, recall during our Q4 call, we announced our intent to move away from providing eCommerce sales growth and eCommerce penetration metrics beginning in Q1. Given the circumstances surrounding our store closures, we provided these metrics last quarter and are continuing to provide these metrics for Q2. We will revisit this decision for the third quarter. And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our third quarter 2020 earnings release before the market opens on November 24, 2020, with our subsequent earnings call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.\n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, we had an exceptionally strong second quarter in which we delivered our highest ever quarterly sales and earnings. We achieved record consolidated sales of $2.71 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 20.7%, even with approximately 15% of our stores closed on average during the period. This followed our 3.2% comp increase last year. Our second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.21 represented a 155% increase over last year, and was also an all-time record.\n Before we get into the details, I want to take a moment to thank our teammates, whose hard work and dedication to our company and to the athletes we serve, made these significant results possible. Concurrent with our strong business performance, I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we returned our teammates from furlough, restored previously reduced salaries and repaid teammates for their lost wages.\n Now back to our Q2 results. Our 20.7% comp sales increase was driven by the continued success of our industry-leading omnichannel experience. Our eCommerce sales were tremendous, increasing nearly 200%. More than 75% of our online sales were fulfilled by our stores, which serve as localized distribution points and are the hub of our omnichannel experience. By the end of June, we reopened 100% of our stores to the public, while continuing to prioritize the health and safety of the teammates and the athletes we serve. We saw increases in both average ticket and transactions as well as growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.\n Lastly, our private brands continue to be a significant source of strength and growth, outperforming the company average by approximately 500 basis points. This broad-based performance is a testament to the flexibility and dedication of our teammates who reacted quickly to meet favorable shifts in consumer demand throughout the quarter. \n During this pandemic, the importance of health and fitness has accelerated. Participation in socially distant outdoor activities has increased, and there has been a greater shift toward athletic apparel and active lifestyle product with people spending more time working and exercising at home. The majority of our assortment sits squarely at the center of these trends.\n Over the past few months, the partnerships demonstrated by our strategic vendors has been unparalleled. During Q2, we leveraged these strong vendor relationships and our private brand supply chain to aggressively chase product in the most in-demand categories. Certain categories in the marketplace were supply constrained, therefore, less promotional and our margin rates increased by 325 basis points during the quarter. This merchandise margin expansion drove significant improvement in gross margin, which increased 456 basis points.\n Now let me touch on our third quarter performance. The favorable shifts in consumer demand that drove our strong comps during Q2 have continued into Q3, partially offset by softness in the key back-to-school categories. With the significant part of back-to-school already behind us, through the first 3 weeks of Q3, our consolidated comp sales have increased 11% with continued margin rate expansion.\n As I look at our business, we're in a great lane right now. We have reopened our stores and remain committed to the procedures to protect our teammates and athletes health and safety. We have enhanced our eCommerce offering with Curbside Pickup and faster shipping. Our product assortment is well tailored to the recent consumer trends, supported by strong relationships with our key brands. And importantly, we're in a strong financial position having paid our line of credit to 0 and have approximately $1 billion in cash. We're really in a great position. In summary, we are extremely pleased with our Q2 results and look forward to the remainder of the year.\n I'd now like to turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our teammates. You are the foundation of our company, and your efforts helped us continue to execute a seamless omnichannel experience and deliver a record-setting comp sales increase for Q2. This morning, I will review our strong brick-and-mortar and online results, and I'll also provide updates on our marketing efforts on our private brands.\n First, we experienced a very strong athlete response to our store reopenings. We saw momentum build throughout the quarter and delivered positive double-digit brick-and-mortar store comps during both June and July. Our teammates have worked tirelessly to adapt to a constantly changing landscape and have demonstrated an unrelenting commitment to serve our athletes and community safely. In recognition of our hourly store and DC teammates efforts, we recently announced the 15% pay premium will be extended through the end of the year. In total, during the second quarter, we invested $42 million across incremental COVID-related compensation and safety measures. Going forward, we expect approximately $50 million of similar costs per quarter through the end of this year.\n Turning to eCommerce. During the second quarter, our online sales increased 194%, with over 50% mobile penetration. This included Curbside Pickup, where we focused on improving speed and convenience and the athlete response remained very strong. eCommerce merchandise margin expanded meaningfully, which along with higher penetration of Curbside and BOPIS sales drove a significant improvement in eCommerce gross margin. We also continue to reduce delivery times to our athletes even as eCommerce demand remained at unprecedented levels. This success online is a direct result of the technology and fulfillment investments we have made over the years as well as better integration of our digital and store channels, as we work to relentlessly improve the athlete experience, enhance our profitability and build a best-in-class omnichannel platform.\n Moving to marketing, where one of our largest assets is our ScoreCard loyalty program. We have over 20 million active users in the program, accounting for more than 70% of our sales. The data from this program drives our digital and direct marketing efforts, which we continued to enhance during Q2, enabling more personalized communications with our athletes. Throughout Q2, we also maintained a strong voice through several compelling marketing initiatives. Our See You Out There campaign inspired athletes everywhere, filling them with hope and motivation to get outside. Our golf-specific marketing was also successful as we focused on our fitting experience and product offerings.\n Most recently, at the end of Q2, we launched our back-to-school campaign, which addresses the ever-changing landscape and acknowledges that no matter how you're going back to school, whether it's in person or on camera, you still need to have the best styles. We paired these larger brand campaigns with more tactical marketing around store reopenings and Curbside Pickup to ensure our athletes knew we were there to get product to them wherever and whenever they wanted it.\n Lastly, across our stores and online, our private brands remain a key source of strength and differentiation within our assortment. As I've mentioned, they outperformed the company average by approximately 500 basis points in Q2. We've been particularly pleased with CALIA and DSG, which represented our second and third largest women's athletic apparel brands during the quarter. And in total, across all categories after only 1 year following its launch, DSG has surpassed Field & Stream to become our largest private brand.\n In closing, we remain very excited about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods as we continue to leverage our best-in-class omnichannel platform to serve our athletes.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our second quarter results. Consolidated sales increased 20.1% to approximately $2.71 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 20.7%, driven by a 17.9% increase in average ticket and a 2.8% increase in transactions. Our eCommerce sales increased 194%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 30% compared to 12% last year. And as Ed mentioned, during the quarter, we delivered growth across each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear merchandise.\n Gross profit in the second quarter was $936.9 million or 34.53% of net sales, a 456 basis point improvement compared to last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 325 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 204 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions as well as better-than-anticipated sales and margin on merchandise nearing end of life. This was partially offset by shipping expenses and eCommerce fulfillment costs as a result of our meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth as well as the fixed costs associated with our 2 eCommerce fulfillment centers that opened in the third quarter last year. Gross profit also included $10 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $543 million or 20.01% of net sales, down 305 basis points from the same period last year due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased only $22 million from the same period last year. This includes $32 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs and $12 million associated with the change in value of our deferred comp plans resulting from the significant increase in overall equity markets in the quarter, which is fully offset in other income and has no impact to earnings. These expenses were partially offset by expense reductions following our temporary store closures.\n Driven by our strong sales and gross profit margin, non-GAAP EBT was $397.8 million or 14.66% of net sales, up $246.7 million or 797 basis points of operating margin expansion versus same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.21 compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.26 last year, a 155% year-over-year increase.\n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.12. This included $6.6 million in noncash interest expense as well as 1.1 million additional shares required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to the convertible notes we issued in Q1. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now I'll briefly review our 2020 first half results. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May, consolidated sales decreased only 3.2% to approximately $4.05 billion. Consolidated same-store sales decreased only 2.3%. Within this, our eCommerce sales increased 154%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 33% versus 12% last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.60, and this included $76 million or $0.65 per diluted share of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs and compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.86 for the first 26 weeks last year.\n Now moving to our balance sheet. As Ed stated, we're in a strong financial position. And during the quarter, we leveraged our cash flow from operations as well as cash on hand to repay $1.4 billion of outstanding borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. We ended Q2 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on our line.\n Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 12% compared to the end of the same period last year. And looking ahead, our inventory is clean and we will continue to optimize our assortment to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand categories.\n As previously announced, in light of our strong business results, we reinstated our dividend program. And during the quarter, we paid $26 million in quarterly dividends. Net capital expenditures were just $12.5 million, and we did not repurchase shares.\n With respect to our full year outlook, there's still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of several key external factors. This includes the COVID-19 pandemic and economic stimulus as well as employment and consumer confidence and their potential impact on our business. Given this uncertainty, we'll not provide a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. We will continue to reassess the practicality of resuming guidance in future quarters. While mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we're extremely pleased with our significant Q2 results as well as our Q3 sales trends. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods.\n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nRobert Ohmes: I'll say a great quarter, but I really don't have a word for a quarter like this. It's pretty unbelievable. The -- Ed, my question, I think, for you is these categories that are doing so great, I think you're not the only ones that are seeing this unbelievable sell-through rate. How are you thinking about in-stock levels in a lot of these solitary leisure categories for the balance of the year, given that others are running short? And do we need to be concerned about your inventory positioning when we think about how we think about your sales run rate going forward? And maybe, Ed, could you tie into that, has anything changed in how you guys are thinking about the hunt category? I know you've exited in a lot of stores. Is that expected to continue? And then lastly, some comments on the Golf category, maybe some insights on how Golf Galaxy comps are doing? \nEdward Stack: Sure. Robby, thanks. Let me start with the hunt category first. So this has not changed our view towards the hunt category. We're still planning to significantly reduce that exit what we're doing with Field & Stream and -- so really, nothing has changed. Although that business, from what I understand, has really been quite good. We're not changing our position on that. \n As we take a look at stock levels, Robby, we're going to be somewhat inventory constrained on some of these categories, but we've got a flow of product that as it comes in, it goes right back out. And we actually think we're going to be in a bit better position from an inventory standpoint going forward in the fitness category, in the bike category and a little bit in the golf category beginning towards the end of September and into October. \n So we've -- our team has done a great job working the supply chain. A number of these products that we talked about from a fitness standpoint, bikes are our own private brands. So we control the supply chain, and the team has done a great job of being able to service the athlete or the customers. So if you're going to walk in our store, it's still going to look like our fitness business is really depleted. But the flow of product we have coming in is kind of going out as fast as it's coming in, and we expect the trends from a sales standpoint in those categories to continue.\n As far as the golf business, golf is one of those categories that there are -- your outdoor social distancing. There's -- it's -- the golf business has been great at both DICK'S and at Galaxy. There's a number of young people who have come into the game because they're not playing football or soccer or some other sports. So they're out playing -- guys are out playing golf because they're not at their kids' games. Men, women and kids have all really -- have jumped into this game, and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year, too. The golf season is being extended with what's going on right now with the playoffs on the PGA tour, followed by the U.S. Open in September and then the Masters in November. So we think golf is one of those categories that's going to be really, really very good.\n And there are some concerns about people saying, \"Well, what's going to happen when it gets cold and people go inside?\" Well, up north, that's a concern if it gets really cold in November and December, but we have so many stores that are in the south and in the west that the weather is going to be -- you're going to be able to get outside 12 months a year. So we're pretty -- we continue to be pretty excited about our business. \nRobert Ohmes: That's great. And just -- do you give the Golf Galaxy comps? \nEdward Stack: We don't, Robby. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: The first question I had was around Team Sports. I wondered if you could maybe go through a little bit more what you're seeing within maybe certain team sport categories and how much maybe that can affect Q3. And then my second question was just about the fulfilling from store. I think you mentioned 75% of eCommerce fulfilled by store. What was that in previous quarters? Was it higher because of the Curbside Pickup option? And will you expect it to be elevated going forward? \nEdward Stack: So Kate, I'll take the one on Team Sports, and then I'll let Lauren talk about eCom. So from a Team Sports standpoint, the Team Sports business is not very good right now with the exception of baseball. The baseball business has continued to be pretty good, but other sports have been difficult. We expect them to continue to be difficult through all of Q3. But we've got the majority of this business behind us. And I think people should understand that the back-to-school business and the Team Sports business is going to be difficult through this back-to-school time frame, but we are more than offsetting that with comps at 11% so far this quarter. And the back-to-school business and the Team Sports business will become less important as we go forward. So -- but Team Sports is going to be difficult. The way we're looking at this is that we're just banking comps for next year with the Team Sports business. We hope it will be better next year. \nLauren Hobart: Great. And I'll take your second question, Kate. So in terms of the percentage of eCommerce business that was fulfilled on the stores, I do think it's meaningful to point out that 75% is a large increase. In the past, we've indicated it was the majority, so over half, but this is a meaningful increase that's being fulfilled from the stores. And yes, you're right, that a lot of that business is going out the front door as well as what used to be just the back door in terms of Curbside and ship from store. Curbside remains really strong even as we open the stores. It's a business that we believe strongly is here to stay. And we believe it will be an important player throughout the back half of the year and into holiday and into the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So first, a follow-up question as you talk about Team Sports is getting behind us and back-to-school has peaked as well. And you have a number of school districts and -- opening later and then in Texas and delayed sport programs in New York State, high school sports are delayed till September 21. So I guess how do you think about the potential acceleration of the business? Can you maybe peel away what's going on in these non -- like what's going on in the comp base x back-to-school and team sports? \nEdward Stack: Well, we won't get into quite that level of detail. But as I said, the team sports and back-to-school business has been soft so far. And even with that being soft and we have a big part of it behind us, the comps are still plus 11%. As we take a look at some of the school districts and states that have indicated that they're going to delay sports, we've got some inventory to be able to service them. But we're not sure that that's actually going to happen when it gets right down to it, are they going to play or they're not going to play. So we're being cautious as we go forward from a team sports standpoint in these fall sports. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. I guess maybe the other way to try to cut the question is you talked about strong trends accelerating, obviously, over the quarter because of how you report comps, including closed stores and then double-digit brick-and-mortar in June and July. So our rough math, you said that you were down 4% quarter-to-date when you reported last time. It looks like you comped 30 in those months. Is that accurate? \nLee Belitsky: That's pretty close, yes. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And my follow-up is, Lee, on the SG&A, obviously, a lot of puts and takes in there. You did have furlough savings. Presumably some -- maybe some rent -- not rent, but maybe some other reduced hours affecting that SG&A line as well. So what's the right base of SG&A to sort of look at our back half estimates on a go-forward basis? Last year, you were $515 million in SG&A and $600 million in the third and fourth quarters. So are we now building off that? Or what's the right base that we're building from? \nLee Belitsky: I think last year is the right base, except you got to take a look at -- in Q3, we had a big piece of incentive comp in there that unless we have really extraordinary results here, we won't anniversary that kind of level of incentive comp. But I think the last year base is a good one to build off of. And then we talked about the incremental COVID expenses of $50 million a quarter. Probably split around $40 million will be on the SG&A line and $10 million on the gross margin -- will hit gross margin. \nChristopher Horvers: And just maybe cut a different way, what -- how much was the furlough savings that was an offset in the SG&A line? \nLee Belitsky: Yes. There were a lot of pieces in there, furlough savings. We had some small reductions in force that are involved. We cut travel, we cut consulting costs. We really battened down the hatches in Q1 and cut CapEx and cut other SG&A expenses along the way. So we did have some pretty significant savings, particularly in the first half of the second quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Was the entirety of the slowdown from 30% comps in June and July to 11% comp quarter-to-date in August due to weakness in back-to-school and team sports? Or did other categories slow as well? \nEdward Stack: It was -- it's pretty much by the back-to-school categories. And then those back-to-school categories is footwear, is all the team sports, which is a pretty violent peak in the month of -- in the first part of August, much more -- a much higher percent of our total sales in August than it will be in September and October. And so those back-to-school categories, the team sports, the cleat business, backpacks, all of those have been soft. But even with that, comps are still running 11% with margin rate expansion. \nMichael Lasser: And to borrow the terms that you used very eloquently, Ed, it's not only fair to think about banking some comp for next year from the Team Sports business getting better -- or next year or whenever we get back to normal, but also back-to-school getting back to normal. So is that the right way to think about it? \nEdward Stack: Yes. I think so, Michael. I think the back-to-school business next year, we hope will be better because we hope kids are actually going back to school in the classroom and playing sports, which we think is really important for the kids. But let's face it, there will be some offset to that, too, of some other categories that might not be quite as strong, but we think we are in a great lane for what's going on right now in the country from an outdoor standpoint, the golf business, the camping business, kayaking, fitness, running. We think we're in a great lane. And a lot of these activities are going to continue into next year even when -- hopefully, next -- sometime next year, COVID is behind us with a vaccine and therapeutics, et cetera. So\u2026 \nMichael Lasser: [Technical Difficulty] you're thinking about it that consumers have adopted all these new behaviors and habits, whether it's working out at home or kayaking or fishing or golfing. And there won't necessarily be giveback next year. These new habits are here to stay and under what conditions would your change -- would your thinking change? And then I'll turn it over. \nEdward Stack: I don\u2019t -- so I think these things are pretty sticky. I think people are going to continue to do these activities. There are some great family activities that have taken place here. And I think people are going to continue those for some time into the future. What would make us think differently about that, if the trends change? But right now, we don't see them changing significantly. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi Research. \nPaul Lejuez: Just to follow-up on the last couple of comments about comp opportunity next year and also maybe some offsets to that. Can you maybe talk about some of the stronger specific categories that you\n [Technical Difficulty] \nEdward Stack: We lost you. Paul, are you still there?\n Operator, if we can go to the next call and then when Paul resumes, we can jump him in the front of the line. \nOperator: Okay. Our next question will come from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask first on gross margin. If you look back to 2019, it ended at around 29% and change and at once peaked at about 31.5%. So it's about 200 basis points below the peak. Does the channel mix explain most of this gap? And I think if we got the math right, it was about a 40 or 50 basis point channel mix headwind this quarter. What would be the reason it can't inch closer to that prior peak? I know eCommerce was probably extra good because of pickup in store, but should it narrow back over time, assuming the merch margin continues to stay healthy? \nLee Belitsky: It should edge back towards that level. There has been a channel shift and the gross margin is lower because we have the delivery expense, we have the shipping expense in eCom, which is a structural difference. But we are leveraging some of the fixed expenses in eCom and in fulfillment along the way. And a lot of it comes down to how promotional we're going to have to be. So we haven't had to be terribly promotional over the last 3 or 4 months or so in eCom. I don't expect we're going to be able to maintain the same levels of gross margin coming out of our eCommerce business indefinitely. But for some time, going forward, we should be able to maintain elevated levels of gross margin. \nEdward Stack: I think it can move closer to that also, too, Simeon, based on what's happening with our private brands. Our private brands are doing extremely well, whether it be CALIA, the DSG brand, what we're doing in a number of other categories, the fitness brands. So as our private brands continue to improve, our margin rates will continue to improve. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And any sense on the stickiness of using this Curbside model, which I'm sure a lot of customers have been introduced to, which wasn't an option before, but obviously, it should be pretty powerful going forward. But how do you -- do you sense that will continue and that these pickup rates will stay high going forward? \nLauren Hobart: Simeon, it's Lauren. We do think that Curbside is here to stay. It's been a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, and we anticipated originally that we would see a large drop off when the stores reopened, but that is not the case. Curbside remains very strongly penetrated and very high percentage of the mix. So it's -- we are -- we think Curbside is a behavior that's here to stay. It's just an added element to a store, so that the store becomes the omnihub of the whole ecosystem. \nLee Belitsky: And we're expecting Curbside to continue to be strong for the balance of the year. We're thinking that with COVID around, there might not be that much an interest in getting into crowded stores in the Christmas season. So we're planning on a big Curbside fall season. We're forward deploying inventory out to our stores to satisfy that demand, setting up all the parking lots to operate that way and we'll be ready for a big Curbside event rest of the year. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And just to sneak this in, Ed, just in terms of the fluidity of the environment, this transition to other seasons as even though the weather will change, in categories like bicycles and fitness, is it still literally the stuff comes in the door and is out that same day? Is it that type of demand environment still? \nEdward Stack: Well, I'm not sure it's that day, Simeon, but it's a few days. It sells off pretty quickly as soon as we have the product in there. But we've got a nice flow of this. We've got an increasing level of supply coming in for fitness product over the next several months, for bikes over the next several months. The boat business is going to be a bit more constrained, although we do have some more product coming in. But we're pretty comfortable on the flow we've got coming in. It's just going to come in and go right back out. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Lejuez of Citi Research. \nPaul Lejuez: Sorry for the phone cutting out there. I was just asking about, maybe if you could talk about some of the stronger performing categories that you saw specifically in the second quarter. And just how do you plan F '21? You've got the comp opportunity perhaps in the back-to-school and team sports categories, but then maybe difficult comparisons in some others. So just curious how you're thinking about it from an inventory perspective? And then also, in some of these categories that you're chasing, are you seeing higher average unit costs in some of those hot trending categories and to what extent are prices may be moving higher, if at all? \nEdward Stack: We really haven't seen higher costs in any meaningful way coming out of these products. And some of these categories we're talking about, whether it be the camping business, the fitness business, the boat business, a lot of these are our own brands. So we control the supply chain, and we've done a pretty good job with that. As we look into next year, what we really are is we're looking at '19 as the year to plan off of. And we've talked to a number of other people who are in our industry, that's what they're doing also -- other brands that we do business with, a lot of them are looking at kind of planning off of '19, and that's what we're planning to do. And we think next year, the -- if a lot of this pandemic is behind us and kids are back in school and playing sports and everyone feels safe, we think there's a big upside in the team sports and the back-to-school business next year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I know you guys aren't going to give guidance per se, but it sounds like, correct me if I'm wrong, the implication with back-to-school and team sports becoming smaller over the coming weeks and months is -- that would tell me that comps would accelerate. Is there an offset to that, such that comps wouldn't accelerate? And excuse the working from home, my dog barking exactly when my question comes up. \nEdward Stack: Michael, we can all relate to barking dogs and working at home. \nMichael Baker: No barking at all today until you called on me -- like my kids. \nEdward Stack: Yes, I understand. No worries. Yes. So you would -- that's not an inappropriate assumption. But last year, too, we were exiting the hunt business last year, and there's a couple of offsets to that. But we're really comfortable and excited about where we're at. And we couldn't be happier that with the back-to-school kind of shaping up the way that it is, which is going to be -- back-to-school is going to be a disappointment for -- I think for a lot of people, but we're fortunate that we've got this broader-based portfolio that we can offset that. And comps at plus 11% right now, we're pretty happy with. And these back-to-school items will become a smaller percent of the balance of the quarter. \nMichael Baker: Yes, makes sense. Understood. Two questions for Lee, real quick, if I could. One, Lee, you said that you're cycling incentive comp in the third quarter unless you have a really strong third quarter this year. Well, you're comping 11% and things could get better, so, I guess, how should we think about potential incentive comp in the third quarter of this year? And then I hate to ask this type of boring question. But the structure you put in place with the convertible in the offsetting hedge, I think at $52.40 -- $52.42 as I recall, that starts to become dilutive. You're above that now. So can you give us any color on how we should think about the share count going forward? \nLee Belitsky: So I'll take on the expense question first. I mean we do have some significant additional expenses that we're incurring here that could -- with the COVID expenses that we have that could impact the payout of incentive comp for this year. So we have to have some really strong comps in order to get to the level of incentive compensation pay that we had last year. So probably greater than the 11% that we've got quarter-to-date.\n With regard to the convertible notes, we did put the bond hedge structure in place. And you're right, the notes economically -- excuse me, the convert becomes economically dilutive at around $52 -- $52.40 or so. Order of magnitude at $55 -- $55 on average for the quarter creates about 900,000 shares of dilution. So it's about 1% dilutive at $55 a share on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, it's about 5.9 million shares on average for the quarter. If we are at $55 price for the quarter, it would be 5.9 million shares. \nMichael Baker: Okay. That's good color. And then presumably, the dilution goes up as the stock price goes higher? \nLee Belitsky: Correct. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the progress in the quarter-to-date. My first question is on the digital -- you're welcome, well deserved. My first question is on the digital business. As that grows, obviously, you can see the data on new customers you've acquired since the pandemic began. Can you share any of those metrics or statistics there?\n For Lauren, can you talk about CALIA and DSG penetration and probably, more importantly, going forward, your physical brick-and-mortar channel is such a competitive advantage given your end of mall and big boxes? Are there opportunities for you to be a distribution channel for digitally native brands in athleisure, footwear or maybe other categories?\n And then, Lee, my last question is, last quarter, inventory had been shipping out of the stores to keep inventory clean. What happened in the third quarter? And what should normalized shift from store be? \nLauren Hobart: Okay. Adrienne, it's Lauren. I'll try to tackle the first few. So as digital grows, we do have new customers joining the DICK'S ecosystem, meaningfully -- a meaningful number of new customers and a meaningful number coming in through the digital channels, and those customers are repeating. So we're very pleased with new customers, generally speaking. I don't think I'm going to go deeper than that at this point. But generally speaking, we're very focused on retaining those new customers this quarter.\n CALIA and DSG are doing amazingly well. As I mentioned, CALIA is #2 and #3 -- they are the #2 and #3 women's athletic, and DSG brand is #1 across the board. We're very focused on private brand growth. I don't want to share a penetration goal with you at this point, but we are very, very, very enthusiastic about those brands as well as some other new brands in the future.\n And then opportunities for us to be distribution channel for digitally native brands, it's a very interesting thing. It's in a longer-term horizon, not something I would say short term. But certainly, we do believe that the omnichannel strength that we have and the fact that we have 800 points of pickup and distribution, getting those direct to home could really be an advantage for us, first and foremost, and possibly in the future, but no immediate plans on that. \nLee Belitsky: Okay. With regard to the fulfillment channels in Q2, obviously, when you have nearly a 200% comp increase, all of our fulfillment channels lifted in terms of volume. So our market fulfillment centers had significant increases year-over-year, Curbside was huge. Our ship from store picked up as well. Our vendor direct programs picked up. So -- and we talked about in total mix, 75% was fulfilled by the stores between ship from store and Curbside. So all channels lifted in volume. The good news is we had the infrastructure in place to handle kind of holiday level eCommerce sales for months on end with all the different fulfillment channels we have turned on. So as Lauren said earlier, a lot of the investments we made over time, both in technology and in fulfillment, really paid off for us during the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up on that last point around the eCommerce economics. Obviously, in this environment, consumer adoption of online has accelerated probably by many years. I'm wondering can you elaborate on the efficiencies and the operating leverage that you're seeing in that perhaps is more encouraging as you think about the scalability of eCommerce. Does it change at all? How you think about the profitability of online over time? I realize that it has been improving in recent years, but does it give you any more confidence in what the profitability could look like over time? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. It definitely does give us confidence that we have, this quarter, been able to leverage all the fixed expenses, all the investments that you mentioned in order to drive more flow-through on the bottom line. We also had increased merch margin and then reduced shipping costs on a per package basis because of the increased BOPIS and Curbside penetration. So overall, a very, very meaningful improvement in our eCommerce P&L and something that we think we can continue to leverage. All of the investments that we've made over time to be able to scale the platform are coming to fruition at this point. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And just to clarify, would the profitability have improved even without the merchandise margin improvement? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, meaningfully. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. Okay. And then just around merchandise margin, you had been bracing for more promotional activity later in the quarter in Q2. It doesn't really seem like that happened. Can you just update us on what you're seeing now? How are you planning for promotional activity for the balance of the year? And then I'm just wondering how much of the constrained promotional activity has tied inventory versus perhaps a more structural change in how vendors are controlling distribution now. \nEdward Stack: We don't really see -- the majority of what's driving our business today, we don't see that becoming more promotional. There are inventory constraints across a number of categories. And with those constraints, we don't think it's going to get very promotional. I think vendors are being very cautious and to make sure that the market doesn't get flooded with products that needs to be cleaned up going into next year. So I think everybody has taken a pretty conservative approach from an inventory standpoint. And inventory will be in very good shape, I think, by the -- at the end of the year. I don't think there'll be a glut, I don't think there'll be a meaningful margin rate erosion. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Great quarter. Congratulations. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Brian. \nBrian Nagel: And I apologize, I had it just for getting too near-term focus. But just when we look at the -- with the performance here so far in the third quarter, and I understand that it's extraordinarily fluid and there may be really no normal markets. But in markets that have opened up more, where you may be seeing more teams -- regular team sports activity, is there -- are you seeing a different performance in the category there than the rest of the chain? \nEdward Stack: Meaningfully. \nBrian Nagel: Okay. Then the second question I have, I guess, as we look into the back half of the year, look, DICK'S is not terribly fashion focused, but there are new product launches from your key vendor partners who help to drive sales. So as you're talking to your partners, given the fluidity, the disruptions in the environment, how are they thinking about product introductions in the back half of the year? How do you think about that as a sales driver? \nEdward Stack: It depends on the category and it depends on the brands. There'll be some -- Callaway is launching a new driver in a few weeks, the -- which we think is going to be great. Some other people have delayed launches to clean up some inventory and -- so that there's not a glut of inventory or they're not doing product launches until some people are talking about not doing any new product launches until actually '22 in some categories, which I'm not going to get into what those are, with those particular brands. I'll let them talk about them. But we -- whether there's going to be newness, I think it's going to be very good. I think some people that have had some newness now, but for reasons that business slowed down, whether that's in some of the team sports area or backpack, some of that kind of stuff, where there's not going to be as much newness going into next year, we think that's perfectly fine. So we have -- we think the brands are being very thoughtful and appropriate in how they're looking at this going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Nikic of Wells Fargo. \nTom Nikic: Congrats on a great quarter. I want to ask -- there's been some news out there about shipping cost increases and some of the carriers levying surcharges for the key holiday season in November and December. Do you have any sort of thoughts around that or mitigation strategies? Or how we should think about the gross margin impact from potential shipping, especially in Q4? \nLee Belitsky: The freight markets are tightening up out there, both truckload, intermodal and package delivery. So we are starting to see some increases in rates there on the package side. UPS has announced across the board rate increases. We are -- we only do a very small part of our business with UPS. Most of it is done with FedEx at this point. But with the higher level of eCommerce business, that is likely to occur in the back half of the year, both with us and with everybody else. I would expect there would be some level of surcharges from both FedEx and UPS going forward for the fall. We don't know the extent of that at this point, but it is a potential headwind for later in the year. That's partially offset by the tremendous amount of Curbside pickup that we're doing, which should mitigate some of that expense on the eCommerce side. So we're excited about being able to offer that to our athletes as well. \nTom Nikic: Got it. And when we think about the -- moving to another topic, when we think about the strong performance in Q2 and the pretty solid quarter-to-date trends despite the back-to-school headwind, is there any way you can think about it in terms of new customer acquisition versus something like wallet share among existing customers? \nLauren Hobart: This is Lauren. I think it's actually a little bit of both. We know we got new customer acquisition, but we also drove higher AURs and more sales within our existing customer base. So it was both. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser of Susquehanna. \nFrederick Gaertner: This is Will on for Sam. I just wanted to follow up on this -- that you guys are taking -- you're obviously taking market share, adding new customers. What are you guys doing to keep these new customers and make them \"sticky\"? \nLauren Hobart: We are really, really focused on trying to get customers into the family and then to retain them. So we are -- we've got a massive database of over 20 million athletes. Every time we get a new athlete, it's an opportunity to try to personalize and customize. And I would say, the main change in what we're doing versus what might have done in the past is that it's not just a promotional basket offer. It's a targeted incentive for people to come into the store. So we -- it's a -- and we also have a ton of brand marketing out there to drive brand's health, but the traffic-driving elements are very personalized and data driven. \nFrederick Gaertner: That's helpful. And then you guys -- you said that your private brands, private label outperformed company average by 500 bps. How does the private label business, specifically for DSG and CALIA compare -- how the performance compare online versus branded? \nEdward Stack: So they're not as -- right now, we're not going to get into a lot of detail, but they're not as penetrated online yet as some other brands, but we're moving in that direction. CALIA is making some real progress, and DSG is really only launched last year. But DSG will be -- this year will be our largest private brand across men's, women's, kids and then into some of the hardlines categories that we have it in. So we're really pleased with what's going on with it. It hasn't -- it's not as strong online yet, but we're working through that. And that's no different than what we expected, really. \nFrederick Gaertner: Got you. And just one more for me. So Lee, as far as the SG&A savings, how much of that savings do you expect to continue over into 2H and then into next year? How much of that is sticky? \nLee Belitsky: In the short term, over the next quarter or 2, we're going to continue to have some savings around travel expenses and consulting and things like that as we're not -- obviously, not traveling as much as we had due to the pandemic. But from a staffing perspective, we are out aggressively hiring right now. So I would expect some of the savings that we had from Q2 to mitigate as we work our way through the year and into next year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from John Kernan of Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Ed, Lauren, Lee, congrats on a phenomenal quarter. I wanted to talk on ScoreCard. Lauren, I think you dropped the number 20 million members, 70% of sales, obviously, driving -- data driven, personalization, marketing, et cetera. Can you talk about the future of this business? What it means, the type of growth you're seeing in members and what you're able to accomplish from a sales per member versus nonmember? \nLauren Hobart: We have a big push behind our ScoreCard program. We've recently, in the past year, launched a gold program to reward our best customers and just keep driving a benefit to them that's better than the standard ScoreCard or the standard customer benefit. So we're driving membership. We have that enhanced online now, so that's easier to apply online, which used to be a barrier. And then just working on the value proposition so that our best customers know how much we value them and just putting everything through that lens when we make any decision to make sure that it's right for our customers and right for, specifically, our best customers. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe one follow-up question. It feels like despite your private label success, a lot of the relationships with your key vendors across a lot of different categories, whether it's soft-lines, hardlines have been strengthened recently. And you're getting top level product, whether it's Callaway Drivers or Nike on the footwear side of things in the footwear decks, they really help you grow and build. I'm just wondering can you talk about the strengthening relationship you have with a lot of your key vendors as we head into next year. Certainly, it feels like on their own conference calls, they're mentioning you more, as we can see it when we walk the stores. And just talk about the strengthening with the key vendors at this point as we go into holiday. \nEdward Stack: Yes. I think we've always had great relationships with our vendors. So this isn't something new. We've worked on this for a number of years, and we've got great partnerships with the people that we do business with. I think one of the reasons that they're strengthening going forward is that we have a footprint that allows us to showcase kind of a brand's entire brand, whereas some other retailers that they do business with, they can showcase a portion of a brand, we can showcase an entire brand. If you take a look at some of the athletic companies, we can showcase the apparel footwear in the hardline side of their business, where some others can't. When you take a look at from a golf standpoint, what -- we can showcase across the Callaway's brand for clubs, bags, balls, gloves, the accessory piece of the business. And I think they're looking at us as somebody who can showcase their entire brand, give a great presentation to the consumer walking in that they can't get. \n A couple of people have said to us, \"You guys -- the way you guys present and the space that you dedicate to and the way that you service it and the way that you merchandise it, is how we would want to do it if we were doing our own store.\" And I think they just see us as a great gateway to the consumer. And the relationships have just continued to strengthen. And our vendors do what they say they're going to do, and they know that if we say we're going to do something, we're going to do it. So I think the one thing that's really helping to strengthen the relationships with the vendors is the trust and communication on both sides. And there's been more communication, more strategic planning and more trust between us and our key vendors than I think there ever has been in the past. And we see that continuing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Warren Cheng of Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: I had a question on the new OVERTIME and Warehouse outlet stores that have been -- that are half way through the quarter. How much of the store base is able to utilize the centers for clearance? And is it changing the realizations that you're getting on some of the end of life merchandise? \nEdward Stack: So it's definitely -- this is very -- this concept is very much at its infancy stage right now. We don't have many of them out there, but we've got -- they can take a lot of the clearance merchandise we can get out of the stores, the traditional stores and make room for the new product, which is really -- is another thing that's helping our margins, and we're able to realize a higher-margin rate in these stores than if we kept it in our store and tried to clean it out. So it's been -- it's early on, we're really pleased with what's going on here with these stores. \nWarren Cheng: Okay. And then just going forward beyond this year, how do you see that fitting into your overall current strategy? How many more -- or how much larger can that footprint be going forward? \nEdward Stack: Right now, we really don't know. We're just in the test phase. We'll see how it goes. There's -- we're working through this right now. Early on, we were very pleased with it, but we're not really ready to guide what this can be or how we're going to go with it going forward. It's still really much -- very much in the test phase. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Benedict of Baird. \nPeter Benedict: Two questions. First, just maybe, Lee, an update on the occupancy cost reductions, your progress on that front with some of your landlords. And I'm curious, how does Curbside figure into those discussions at all, the enhanced use of this Curbside fulfillment. Does that influence those discussions? And then secondly, the BOPIS attachment rates, when folks are coming into the store to pick up an order. What have those attachment rates been historically? And are you seeing any change in that in the current environment when people are doing BOPIS? \nLee Belitsky: So with regard to the occupancy costs, we made some pretty good progress in the second quarter on negotiations of occupancy costs in cases where the stores were closed. And a number of the leases, we had opportunity to abate our rents during a period of time that the stores were closed. From an accounting perspective, we've elected to defer those gains and spread the gains over the remaining life of the lease. So we didn't pick up those earnings in -- during the quarter. Most of those discussions have wrapped up by now, and we're back to paying rent pretty much everywhere at this point. So relationships are pretty good right now, I'd say, with our landlord community. \nLauren Hobart: On the BOPIS question, in terms of attachment rates, we are -- we haven't -- something that we've disclosed in the past, but we are actually trying to drive reasonable attachments and UPT with every transaction, be it in store, Curbside or Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. And if you go see some of our Curbside expressions, you'll see relevant attachment items, sometimes out on the curb that people can buy and/or offered on the website when you place the orders -- you'll also need this system in it. So we're definitely focused on that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: You mentioned that you have seen some meaningful performance differences in various geographies. Can you guys provide any more color on that? And I guess I'm really curious, do you actually start to see a countercyclical effect where the sales of personal fitness and outdoor products actually accelerate enough where it more than offsets the team sports, where we've had additional COVID-19 outbreaks? \nEdward Stack: We're not going to get into kind of the geographic piece of this. What we did say is where they\u2019re playing team sports, we've seen the Team Sports business meaningfully outperform where they're not, which is not surprising. I think the fitness business is going to be very good all over it. And people are just -- know that in order to fight the pandemic or whatever comes next, people need to be healthy. And that doesn't mean that we're going to have a lot of marathon runners, but people are going to get out and they're going to walk, they're going to buy a treadmill, they're going to do -- lift some weights, even if they're lightweights, kettlebells, this whole fitness trend is just people are going to try to be healthier. And we don't see that changing even when COVID-19 is in our rearview mirror for quite a while. \nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. And then, I guess, a follow-up here. I'm just curious if your field teams are starting to see any competitive closures. It just seems like a lot of the biggest economic pressures we're seeing within the retail landscape or on smaller private companies, one-off businesses and the like, I wonder if you start to see any of that in your particular sector. \nEdward Stack: Well, we've seen some closures. I mean, Modell's is -- even before COVID, they were going to close. So Modell's is closing. I think we'll see a number of competitors close stores, and we think we'll be a beneficiary of some of this as it happens. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Svezia of Wedbush. \nChristopher Svezia: Congratulations. I've got 2. I guess, first, just on the -- just curious the 75% that's -- of eCom that fulfilled in stores, did you call out by any chance how much of that is actually -- what percentage of that is actually Curbside? I'm curious about that, number one. And number two, I guess, Ed, for you, overall, when you made a comment earlier that you're planning the business off of 2019. I guess I'm curious, as we look at the business model from a financial perspective, is that a way we should be looking at it as well, just given a lot of the sort of abnormality and fluctuations we're going to see in 2020, some things stick around, some things don't. Is that a fair way to kind of look at it? Or do you feel like there is structurally going to be revenue benefits, margin benefits that will carry into 2021 over and above, how we should think about looking at 2019? \nLauren Hobart: Chris, so in terms of your first question, we haven't specifically broken out how much Curbside is as a percent of that 75%, but we did say that it used to be majority right around half, and it's now 75% that's coming through the stores. So you can do some rough interpretation there in terms of Curbside, it's very meaningful.\n And Ed, do you want to take the second one? \nEdward Stack: And as far as we go into '19, I think you've got to look at your model, however, it works for you. We're going off '19 because we suspect next year, in the first quarter, if you just look at it versus '20, our comps will be positive. I'm not sure that our comps will be positive in the second quarter next year just because in the second quarter -- our team did a great job. There was some pent-up demand from Q1. So this is a really odd year of how this is all going to play out. And hopefully, '21 will be a more predictable year, let's put it that way. And the best way we think to do this is to go off of '19 from not only a sales standpoint, inventory standpoint. It's been our job to make a decision of what we think is going to happen category by category, department by department in region of the -- country by region of the country. And so we've already started talking about this. We've started planning for '21 already, as you would expect. And we're really using '19 as the base of where to go. \nChristopher Svezia: And just a follow-up -- quick one just from a -- and that's helpful. But just from a margin perspective, eCommerce, things like Curbside, Pickup, just sort of the sustainability of those to structurally impact the margin for the better as we move forward, just how do I -- how do maybe do we think that? And against the offsets to a degree as we start to think about that as well? \nEdward Stack: I think the eCommerce business is going to continue to accelerate. I think the Curbside piece is going to accelerate. So I think the Curbside piece is what I think some people miss about this is it started off as a safety piece. People wanted it because they didn't want to come in contact with anyone else. It's now becoming a convenience piece. There was -- a number of people have said to me, \"Hey, Curbside was great. I called, I got there, I sent the text or I made the phone call, in a couple of minutes, they brought the product up, and I was on my way.\" So this is really getting to be a convenience piece. I think it will be more a convenience piece in '21 than it is a health and safety concern as it is today. So we think that's going to continue. And I think that will accelerate. But one thing everybody -- I'm not -- maybe not right now, but the one thing everybody felt time constrained was their time. And I think Curbside gives people some time back, and I think it's going to continue. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ed Stack for any closing remarks. \nEdward Stack: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our Q2 call, and we'll look forward to talking to everybody when we release earnings for Q3. Thank you very much, and everybody stay well and stay safe. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, we had an exceptionally strong second quarter in which we delivered our highest ever quarterly sales and earnings. We achieved record consolidated sales of $2.71 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 20.7%, even with approximately 15% of our stores closed on average during the period. This followed our 3.2% comp increase last year. Our second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.21 represented a 155% increase over last year, and was also an all-time record.\n Before we get into the details, I want to take a moment to thank our teammates, whose hard work and dedication to our company and to the athletes we serve, made these significant results possible. Concurrent with our strong business performance, I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we returned our teammates from furlough, restored previously reduced salaries and repaid teammates for their lost wages.\n Now back to our Q2 results. Our 20.7% comp sales increase was driven by the continued success of our industry-leading omnichannel experience. Our eCommerce sales were tremendous, increasing nearly 200%. More than 75% of our online sales were fulfilled by our stores, which serve as localized distribution points and are the hub of our omnichannel experience. By the end of June, we reopened 100% of our stores to the public, while continuing to prioritize the health and safety of the teammates and the athletes we serve. We saw increases in both average ticket and transactions as well as growth across each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear.\n Lastly, our private brands continue to be a significant source of strength and growth, outperforming the company average by approximately 500 basis points. This broad-based performance is a testament to the flexibility and dedication of our teammates who reacted quickly to meet favorable shifts in consumer demand throughout the quarter. \n During this pandemic, the importance of health and fitness has accelerated. Participation in socially distant outdoor activities has increased, and there has been a greater shift toward athletic apparel and active lifestyle product with people spending more time working and exercising at home. The majority of our assortment sits squarely at the center of these trends.\n Over the past few months, the partnerships demonstrated by our strategic vendors has been unparalleled. During Q2, we leveraged these strong vendor relationships and our private brand supply chain to aggressively chase product in the most in-demand categories. Certain categories in the marketplace were supply constrained, therefore, less promotional and our margin rates increased by 325 basis points during the quarter. This merchandise margin expansion drove significant improvement in gross margin, which increased 456 basis points.\n Now let me touch on our third quarter performance. The favorable shifts in consumer demand that drove our strong comps during Q2 have continued into Q3, partially offset by softness in the key back-to-school categories. With the significant part of back-to-school already behind us, through the first 3 weeks of Q3, our consolidated comp sales have increased 11% with continued margin rate expansion.\n As I look at our business, we're in a great lane right now. We have reopened our stores and remain committed to the procedures to protect our teammates and athletes health and safety. We have enhanced our eCommerce offering with Curbside Pickup and faster shipping. Our product assortment is well tailored to the recent consumer trends, supported by strong relationships with our key brands. And importantly, we're in a strong financial position having paid our line of credit to 0 and have approximately $1 billion in cash. We're really in a great position. In summary, we are extremely pleased with our Q2 results and look forward to the remainder of the year.\n I'd now like to turn the call over to Lauren. Sure. Robby, thanks. Let me start with the hunt category first. So this has not changed our view towards the hunt category. We're still planning to significantly reduce that exit what we're doing with Field & Stream and -- so really, nothing has changed. Although that business, from what I understand, has really been quite good. We're not changing our position on that. \n As we take a look at stock levels, Robby, we're going to be somewhat inventory constrained on some of these categories, but we've got a flow of product that as it comes in, it goes right back out. And we actually think we're going to be in a bit better position from an inventory standpoint going forward in the fitness category, in the bike category and a little bit in the golf category beginning towards the end of September and into October. \n So we've -- our team has done a great job working the supply chain. A number of these products that we talked about from a fitness standpoint, bikes are our own private brands. So we control the supply chain, and the team has done a great job of being able to service the athlete or the customers. So if you're going to walk in our store, it's still going to look like our fitness business is really depleted. But the flow of product we have coming in is kind of going out as fast as it's coming in, and we expect the trends from a sales standpoint in those categories to continue.\n As far as the golf business, golf is one of those categories that there are -- your outdoor social distancing. There's -- it's -- the golf business has been great at both DICK'S and at Galaxy. There's a number of young people who have come into the game because they're not playing football or soccer or some other sports. So they're out playing -- guys are out playing golf because they're not at their kids' games. Men, women and kids have all really -- have jumped into this game, and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year, too. The golf season is being extended with what's going on right now with the playoffs on the PGA tour, followed by the U.S. Open in September and then the Masters in November. So we think golf is one of those categories that's going to be really, really very good.\n And there are some concerns about people saying, \"Well, what's going to happen when it gets cold and people go inside?\" Well, up north, that's a concern if it gets really cold in November and December, but we have so many stores that are in the south and in the west that the weather is going to be -- you're going to be able to get outside 12 months a year. So we're pretty -- we continue to be pretty excited about our business. We don't, Robby. So Kate, I'll take the one on Team Sports, and then I'll let Lauren talk about eCom. So from a Team Sports standpoint, the Team Sports business is not very good right now with the exception of baseball. The baseball business has continued to be pretty good, but other sports have been difficult. We expect them to continue to be difficult through all of Q3. But we've got the majority of this business behind us. And I think people should understand that the back-to-school business and the Team Sports business is going to be difficult through this back-to-school time frame, but we are more than offsetting that with comps at 11% so far this quarter. And the back-to-school business and the Team Sports business will become less important as we go forward. So -- but Team Sports is going to be difficult. The way we're looking at this is that we're just banking comps for next year with the Team Sports business. We hope it will be better next year. Well, we won't get into quite that level of detail. But as I said, the team sports and back-to-school business has been soft so far. And even with that being soft and we have a big part of it behind us, the comps are still plus 11%. As we take a look at some of the school districts and states that have indicated that they're going to delay sports, we've got some inventory to be able to service them. But we're not sure that that's actually going to happen when it gets right down to it, are they going to play or they're not going to play. So we're being cautious as we go forward from a team sports standpoint in these fall sports. It was -- it's pretty much by the back-to-school categories. And then those back-to-school categories is footwear, is all the team sports, which is a pretty violent peak in the month of -- in the first part of August, much more -- a much higher percent of our total sales in August than it will be in September and October. And so those back-to-school categories, the team sports, the cleat business, backpacks, all of those have been soft. But even with that, comps are still running 11% with margin rate expansion. Yes. I think so, Michael. I think the back-to-school business next year, we hope will be better because we hope kids are actually going back to school in the classroom and playing sports, which we think is really important for the kids. But let's face it, there will be some offset to that, too, of some other categories that might not be quite as strong, but we think we are in a great lane for what's going on right now in the country from an outdoor standpoint, the golf business, the camping business, kayaking, fitness, running. We think we're in a great lane. And a lot of these activities are going to continue into next year even when -- hopefully, next -- sometime next year, COVID is behind us with a vaccine and therapeutics, et cetera. So... I don't -- so I think these things are pretty sticky. I think people are going to continue to do these activities. There are some great family activities that have taken place here. And I think people are going to continue those for some time into the future. What would make us think differently about that, if the trends change? But right now, we don't see them changing significantly. We lost you. Paul, are you still there?\n Operator, if we can go to the next call and then when Paul resumes, we can jump him in the front of the line. I think it can move closer to that also, too, Simeon, based on what's happening with our private brands. Our private brands are doing extremely well, whether it be CALIA, the DSG brand, what we're doing in a number of other categories, the fitness brands. So as our private brands continue to improve, our margin rates will continue to improve. Well, I'm not sure it's that day, Simeon, but it's a few days. It sells off pretty quickly as soon as we have the product in there. But we've got a nice flow of this. We've got an increasing level of supply coming in for fitness product over the next several months, for bikes over the next several months. The boat business is going to be a bit more constrained, although we do have some more product coming in. But we're pretty comfortable on the flow we've got coming in. It's just going to come in and go right back out. We really haven't seen higher costs in any meaningful way coming out of these products. And some of these categories we're talking about, whether it be the camping business, the fitness business, the boat business, a lot of these are our own brands. So we control the supply chain, and we've done a pretty good job with that. As we look into next year, what we really are is we're looking at '19 as the year to plan off of. And we've talked to a number of other people who are in our industry, that's what they're doing also -- other brands that we do business with, a lot of them are looking at kind of planning off of '19, and that's what we're planning to do. And we think next year, the -- if a lot of this pandemic is behind us and kids are back in school and playing sports and everyone feels safe, we think there's a big upside in the team sports and the back-to-school business next year. Michael, we can all relate to barking dogs and working at home. Yes, I understand. No worries. Yes. So you would -- that's not an inappropriate assumption. But last year, too, we were exiting the hunt business last year, and there's a couple of offsets to that. But we're really comfortable and excited about where we're at. And we couldn't be happier that with the back-to-school kind of shaping up the way that it is, which is going to be -- back-to-school is going to be a disappointment for -- I think for a lot of people, but we're fortunate that we've got this broader-based portfolio that we can offset that. And comps at plus 11% right now, we're pretty happy with. And these back-to-school items will become a smaller percent of the balance of the quarter. We don't really see -- the majority of what's driving our business today, we don't see that becoming more promotional. There are inventory constraints across a number of categories. And with those constraints, we don't think it's going to get very promotional. I think vendors are being very cautious and to make sure that the market doesn't get flooded with products that needs to be cleaned up going into next year. So I think everybody has taken a pretty conservative approach from an inventory standpoint. And inventory will be in very good shape, I think, by the -- at the end of the year. I don't think there'll be a glut, I don't think there'll be a meaningful margin rate erosion. Thanks, Brian. Meaningfully. It depends on the category and it depends on the brands. There'll be some -- Callaway is launching a new driver in a few weeks, the -- which we think is going to be great. Some other people have delayed launches to clean up some inventory and -- so that there's not a glut of inventory or they're not doing product launches until some people are talking about not doing any new product launches until actually '22 in some categories, which I'm not going to get into what those are, with those particular brands. I'll let them talk about them. But we -- whether there's going to be newness, I think it's going to be very good. I think some people that have had some newness now, but for reasons that business slowed down, whether that's in some of the team sports area or backpack, some of that kind of stuff, where there's not going to be as much newness going into next year, we think that's perfectly fine. So we have -- we think the brands are being very thoughtful and appropriate in how they're looking at this going forward. So they're not as -- right now, we're not going to get into a lot of detail, but they're not as penetrated online yet as some other brands, but we're moving in that direction. CALIA is making some real progress, and DSG is really only launched last year. But DSG will be -- this year will be our largest private brand across men's, women's, kids and then into some of the hardlines categories that we have it in. So we're really pleased with what's going on with it. It hasn't -- it's not as strong online yet, but we're working through that. And that's no different than what we expected, really. Yes. I think we've always had great relationships with our vendors. So this isn't something new. We've worked on this for a number of years, and we've got great partnerships with the people that we do business with. I think one of the reasons that they're strengthening going forward is that we have a footprint that allows us to showcase kind of a brand's entire brand, whereas some other retailers that they do business with, they can showcase a portion of a brand, we can showcase an entire brand. If you take a look at some of the athletic companies, we can showcase the apparel footwear in the hardline side of their business, where some others can't. When you take a look at from a golf standpoint, what -- we can showcase across the Callaway's brand for clubs, bags, balls, gloves, the accessory piece of the business. And I think they're looking at us as somebody who can showcase their entire brand, give a great presentation to the consumer walking in that they can't get. \n A couple of people have said to us, \"You guys -- the way you guys present and the space that you dedicate to and the way that you service it and the way that you merchandise it, is how we would want to do it if we were doing our own store.\" And I think they just see us as a great gateway to the consumer. And the relationships have just continued to strengthen. And our vendors do what they say they're going to do, and they know that if we say we're going to do something, we're going to do it. So I think the one thing that's really helping to strengthen the relationships with the vendors is the trust and communication on both sides. And there's been more communication, more strategic planning and more trust between us and our key vendors than I think there ever has been in the past. And we see that continuing. So it's definitely -- this is very -- this concept is very much at its infancy stage right now. We don't have many of them out there, but we've got -- they can take a lot of the clearance merchandise we can get out of the stores, the traditional stores and make room for the new product, which is really -- is another thing that's helping our margins, and we're able to realize a higher-margin rate in these stores than if we kept it in our store and tried to clean it out.

There's -- we're working through this right now. Early on, we were very pleased with it, but we're not really ready to guide what this can be or how we're going to go with it going forward. It's still really much -- very much in the test phase. We're not going to get into kind of the geographic piece of this.

I think the fitness business is going to be very good all over it. And people are just -- know that in order to fight the pandemic or whatever comes next, people need to be healthy. And that doesn't mean that we're going to have a lot of marathon runners, but people are going to get out and they're going to walk, they're going to buy a treadmill, they're going to do -- lift some weights, even if they're lightweights, kettlebells, this whole fitness trend is just people are going to try to be healthier. And we don't see that changing even when COVID-19 is in our rearview mirror for quite a while. Well, we've seen some closures. I mean, Modell's is -- even before COVID, they were going to close. So Modell's is closing. I think we'll see a number of competitors close stores, and we think we'll be a beneficiary of some of this as it happens. And as far as we go into '19, I think you've got to look at your model, however, it works for you. We're going off '19 because we suspect next year, in the first quarter, if you just look at it versus '20, our comps will be positive. I'm not sure that our comps will be positive in the second quarter next year just because in the second quarter -- our team did a great job. There was some pent-up demand from Q1.

And so we've already started talking about this. We've started planning for '21 already, as you would expect. And we're really using '19 as the base of where to go. I think the eCommerce business is going to continue to accelerate. I think the Curbside piece is going to accelerate. So I think the Curbside piece is what I think some people miss about this is it started off as a safety piece. People wanted it because they didn't want to come in contact with anyone else. It's now becoming a convenience piece. There was -- a number of people have said to me, \"Hey, Curbside was great. I called, I got there, I sent the text or I made the phone call, in a couple of minutes, they brought the product up, and I was on my way.\" So this is really getting to be a convenience piece. I think it will be more a convenience piece in '21 than it is a health and safety concern as it is today. So we think that's going to continue. And I think that will accelerate. But one thing everybody -- I'm not -- maybe not right now, but the one thing everybody felt time constrained was their time. And I think Curbside gives people some time back, and I think it's going to continue. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our Q2 call, and we'll look forward to talking to everybody when we release earnings for Q3. Thank you very much, and everybody stay well and stay safe."

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our teammates. You are the foundation of our company, and your efforts helped us continue to execute a seamless omnichannel experience and deliver a record-setting comp sales increase for Q2. This morning, I will review our strong brick-and-mortar and online results, and I'll also provide updates on our marketing efforts on our private brands.\n First, we experienced a very strong athlete response to our store reopenings. We saw momentum build throughout the quarter and delivered positive double-digit brick-and-mortar store comps during both June and July. Our teammates have worked tirelessly to adapt to a constantly changing landscape and have demonstrated an unrelenting commitment to serve our athletes and community safely. In recognition of our hourly store and DC teammates efforts, we recently announced the 15% pay premium will be extended through the end of the year. In total, during the second quarter, we invested $42 million across incremental COVID-related compensation and safety measures. Going forward, we expect approximately $50 million of similar costs per quarter through the end of this year.\n Turning to eCommerce. During the second quarter, our online sales increased 194%, with over 50% mobile penetration. This included Curbside Pickup, where we focused on improving speed and convenience and the athlete response remained very strong. eCommerce merchandise margin expanded meaningfully, which along with higher penetration of Curbside and BOPIS sales drove a significant improvement in eCommerce gross margin. We also continue to reduce delivery times to our athletes even as eCommerce demand remained at unprecedented levels. This success online is a direct result of the technology and fulfillment investments we have made over the years as well as better integration of our digital and store channels, as we work to relentlessly improve the athlete experience, enhance our profitability and build a best-in-class omnichannel platform.\n Moving to marketing, where one of our largest assets is our ScoreCard loyalty program. We have over 20 million active users in the program, accounting for more than 70% of our sales. The data from this program drives our digital and direct marketing efforts, which we continued to enhance during Q2, enabling more personalized communications with our athletes. Throughout Q2, we also maintained a strong voice through several compelling marketing initiatives. Our See You Out There campaign inspired athletes everywhere, filling them with hope and motivation to get outside. Our golf-specific marketing was also successful as we focused on our fitting experience and product offerings.\n Most recently, at the end of Q2, we launched our back-to-school campaign, which addresses the ever-changing landscape and acknowledges that no matter how you're going back to school, whether it's in person or on camera, you still need to have the best styles. We paired these larger brand campaigns with more tactical marketing around store reopenings and Curbside Pickup to ensure our athletes knew we were there to get product to them wherever and whenever they wanted it.\n Lastly, across our stores and online, our private brands remain a key source of strength and differentiation within our assortment. As I've mentioned, they outperformed the company average by approximately 500 basis points in Q2. We've been particularly pleased with CALIA and DSG, which represented our second and third largest women's athletic apparel brands during the quarter. And in total, across all categories after only 1 year following its launch, DSG has surpassed Field & Stream to become our largest private brand.\n In closing, we remain very excited about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods as we continue to leverage our best-in-class omnichannel platform to serve our athletes.\n I'll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. Great. And I'll take your second question, Kate. So in terms of the percentage of eCommerce business that was fulfilled on the stores, I do think it's meaningful to point out that 75% is a large increase. In the past, we've indicated it was the majority, so over half, but this is a meaningful increase that's being fulfilled from the stores. And yes, you're right, that a lot of that business is going out the front door as well as what used to be just the back door in terms of Curbside and ship from store. Curbside remains really strong even as we open the stores. It's a business that we believe strongly is here to stay. And we believe it will be an important player throughout the back half of the year and into holiday and into the future. Simeon, it's Lauren. We do think that Curbside is here to stay. It's been a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, and we anticipated originally that we would see a large drop off when the stores reopened, but that is not the case. Curbside remains very strongly penetrated and very high percentage of the mix. So it's -- we are -- we think Curbside is a behavior that's here to stay. It's just an added element to a store, so that the store becomes the omnihub of the whole ecosystem. Okay. Adrienne, it's Lauren. I'll try to tackle the first few. So as digital grows, we do have new customers joining the DICK'S ecosystem, meaningfully -- a meaningful number of new customers and a meaningful number coming in through the digital channels, and those customers are repeating. So we're very pleased with new customers, generally speaking. I don't think I'm going to go deeper than that at this point. But generally speaking, we're very focused on retaining those new customers this quarter.\n CALIA and DSG are doing amazingly well. As I mentioned, CALIA is #2 and #3 -- they are the #2 and #3 women's athletic, and DSG brand is #1 across the board. We're very focused on private brand growth. I don't want to share a penetration goal with you at this point, but we are very, very, very enthusiastic about those brands as well as some other new brands in the future.\n And then opportunities for us to be distribution channel for digitally native brands, it's a very interesting thing. It's in a longer-term horizon, not something I would say short term. But certainly, we do believe that the omnichannel strength that we have and the fact that we have 800 points of pickup and distribution, getting those direct to home could really be an advantage for us, first and foremost, and possibly in the future, but no immediate plans on that. Yes. It definitely does give us confidence that we have, this quarter, been able to leverage all the fixed expenses, all the investments that you mentioned in order to drive more flow-through on the bottom line. We also had increased merch margin and then reduced shipping costs on a per package basis because of the increased BOPIS and Curbside penetration. So overall, a very, very meaningful improvement in our eCommerce P&L and something that we think we can continue to leverage. All of the investments that we've made over time to be able to scale the platform are coming to fruition at this point. Yes, meaningfully. This is Lauren. I think it's actually a little bit of both. We know we got new customer acquisition, but we also drove higher AURs and more sales within our existing customer base. So it was both. We are really, really focused on trying to get customers into the family and then to retain them. So we are -- we've got a massive database of over 20 million athletes. Every time we get a new athlete, it's an opportunity to try to personalize and customize. And I would say, the main change in what we're doing versus what might have done in the past is that it's not just a promotional basket offer. It's a targeted incentive for people to come into the store. So we -- it's a -- and we also have a ton of brand marketing out there to drive brand's health, but the traffic-driving elements are very personalized and data driven. We have a big push behind our ScoreCard program. We've recently, in the past year, launched a gold program to reward our best customers and just keep driving a benefit to them that's better than the standard ScoreCard or the standard customer benefit. So we're driving membership. We have that enhanced online now, so that's easier to apply online, which used to be a barrier. And then just working on the value proposition so that our best customers know how much we value them and just putting everything through that lens when we make any decision to make sure that it's right for our customers and right for, specifically, our best customers. On the BOPIS question, in terms of attachment rates, we are -- we haven't -- something that we've disclosed in the past, but we are actually trying to drive reasonable attachments and UPT with every transaction, be it in store, Curbside or Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. And if you go see some of our Curbside expressions, you'll see relevant attachment items, sometimes out on the curb that people can buy and/or offered on the website when you place the orders -- you'll also need this system in it. So we're definitely focused on that. Chris, so in terms of your first question, we haven't specifically broken out how much Curbside is as a percent of that 75%, but we did say that it used to be majority right around half, and it's now 75% that's coming through the stores. So you can do some rough interpretation there in terms of Curbside, it's very meaningful.\n And Ed, do you want to take the second one?"

            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our second quarter results. Consolidated sales increased 20.1% to approximately $2.71 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 20.7%, driven by a 17.9% increase in average ticket and a 2.8% increase in transactions. Our eCommerce sales increased 194%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 30% compared to 12% last year. And as Ed mentioned, during the quarter, we delivered growth across each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear merchandise.\n Gross profit in the second quarter was $936.9 million or 34.53% of net sales, a 456 basis point improvement compared to last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 325 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 204 basis points. The merchandise margin rate expansion was primarily driven by fewer promotions as well as better-than-anticipated sales and margin on merchandise nearing end of life. This was partially offset by shipping expenses and eCommerce fulfillment costs as a result of our meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth as well as the fixed costs associated with our 2 eCommerce fulfillment centers that opened in the third quarter last year. Gross profit also included $10 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs.\n SG&A expenses were $543 million or 20.01% of net sales, down 305 basis points from the same period last year due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased only $22 million from the same period last year. This includes $32 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs and $12 million associated with the change in value of our deferred comp plans resulting from the significant increase in overall equity markets in the quarter, which is fully offset in other income and has no impact to earnings. These expenses were partially offset by expense reductions following our temporary store closures.\n Driven by our strong sales and gross profit margin, non-GAAP EBT was $397.8 million or 14.66% of net sales, up $246.7 million or 797 basis points of operating margin expansion versus same period last year. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.21 compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.26 last year, a 155% year-over-year increase.\n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.12. This included $6.6 million in noncash interest expense as well as 1.1 million additional shares required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to the convertible notes we issued in Q1. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now I'll briefly review our 2020 first half results. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May, consolidated sales decreased only 3.2% to approximately $4.05 billion. Consolidated same-store sales decreased only 2.3%. Within this, our eCommerce sales increased 154%. And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 33% versus 12% last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.60, and this included $76 million or $0.65 per diluted share of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs and compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.86 for the first 26 weeks last year.\n Now moving to our balance sheet. As Ed stated, we're in a strong financial position. And during the quarter, we leveraged our cash flow from operations as well as cash on hand to repay $1.4 billion of outstanding borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. We ended Q2 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on our line.\n Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 12% compared to the end of the same period last year. And looking ahead, our inventory is clean and we will continue to optimize our assortment to improve our in-stock positions in the most in-demand categories.\n As previously announced, in light of our strong business results, we reinstated our dividend program. And during the quarter, we paid $26 million in quarterly dividends. Net capital expenditures were just $12.5 million, and we did not repurchase shares.\n With respect to our full year outlook, there's still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of several key external factors. This includes the COVID-19 pandemic and economic stimulus as well as employment and consumer confidence and their potential impact on our business. Given this uncertainty, we'll not provide a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. We will continue to reassess the practicality of resuming guidance in future quarters. While mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we're extremely pleased with our significant Q2 results as well as our Q3 sales trends. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods.\n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open up the line for questions. That's pretty close, yes. I think last year is the right base, except you got to take a look at -- in Q3, we had a big piece of incentive comp in there that unless we have really extraordinary results here, we won't anniversary that kind of level of incentive comp. But I think the last year base is a good one to build off of. And then we talked about the incremental COVID expenses of $50 million a quarter. Probably split around $40 million will be on the SG&A line and $10 million on the gross margin -- will hit gross margin. Yes. There were a lot of pieces in there, furlough savings. We had some small reductions in force that are involved. We cut travel, we cut consulting costs. We really battened down the hatches in Q1 and cut CapEx and cut other SG&A expenses along the way. So we did have some pretty significant savings, particularly in the first half of the second quarter. It should edge back towards that level. There has been a channel shift and the gross margin is lower because we have the delivery expense, we have the shipping expense in eCom, which is a structural difference. But we are leveraging some of the fixed expenses in eCom and in fulfillment along the way. And a lot of it comes down to how promotional we're going to have to be. So we haven't had to be terribly promotional over the last 3 or 4 months or so in eCom. I don't expect we're going to be able to maintain the same levels of gross margin coming out of our eCommerce business indefinitely. But for some time, going forward, we should be able to maintain elevated levels of gross margin. And we're expecting Curbside to continue to be strong for the balance of the year. We're thinking that with COVID around, there might not be that much an interest in getting into crowded stores in the Christmas season. So we're planning on a big Curbside fall season. We're forward deploying inventory out to our stores to satisfy that demand, setting up all the parking lots to operate that way and we'll be ready for a big Curbside event rest of the year. So I'll take on the expense question first. I mean we do have some significant additional expenses that we're incurring here that could -- with the COVID expenses that we have that could impact the payout of incentive comp for this year. So we have to have some really strong comps in order to get to the level of incentive compensation pay that we had last year. So probably greater than the 11% that we've got quarter-to-date.\n With regard to the convertible notes, we did put the bond hedge structure in place. And you're right, the notes economically -- excuse me, the convert becomes economically dilutive at around $52 -- $52.40 or so. Order of magnitude at $55 -- $55 on average for the quarter creates about 900,000 shares of dilution. So it's about 1% dilutive at $55 a share on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, it's about 5.9 million shares on average for the quarter. If we are at $55 price for the quarter, it would be 5.9 million shares. Correct. Okay. With regard to the fulfillment channels in Q2, obviously, when you have nearly a 200% comp increase, all of our fulfillment channels lifted in terms of volume. So our market fulfillment centers had significant increases year-over-year, Curbside was huge. Our ship from store picked up as well. Our vendor direct programs picked up. So -- and we talked about in total mix, 75% was fulfilled by the stores between ship from store and Curbside. So all channels lifted in volume. The good news is we had the infrastructure in place to handle kind of holiday level eCommerce sales for months on end with all the different fulfillment channels we have turned on. So as Lauren said earlier, a lot of the investments we made over time, both in technology and in fulfillment, really paid off for us during the quarter. The freight markets are tightening up out there, both truckload, intermodal and package delivery. So we are starting to see some increases in rates there on the package side. UPS has announced across the board rate increases. We are -- we only do a very small part of our business with UPS. Most of it is done with FedEx at this point. But with the higher level of eCommerce business, that is likely to occur in the back half of the year, both with us and with everybody else. I would expect there would be some level of surcharges from both FedEx and UPS going forward for the fall. We don't know the extent of that at this point, but it is a potential headwind for later in the year. That's partially offset by the tremendous amount of Curbside pickup that we're doing, which should mitigate some of that expense on the eCommerce side. So we're excited about being able to offer that to our athletes as well. In the short term, over the next quarter or 2, we're going to continue to have some savings around travel expenses and consulting and things like that as we're not -- obviously, not traveling as much as we had due to the pandemic. But from a staffing perspective, we are out aggressively hiring right now. So I would expect some of the savings that we had from Q2 to mitigate as we work our way through the year and into next year. So with regard to the occupancy costs, we made some pretty good progress in the second quarter on negotiations of occupancy costs in cases where the stores were closed. And a number of the leases, we had opportunity to abate our rents during a period of time that the stores were closed. From an accounting perspective, we've elected to defer those gains and spread the gains over the remaining life of the lease. So we didn't pick up those earnings in -- during the quarter. Most of those discussions have wrapped up by now, and we're back to paying rent pretty much everywhere at this point. So relationships are pretty good right now, I'd say, with our landlord community."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2020 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.  \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in the earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. \n And finally, a couple of admin items: First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Recall last quarter, we announced our intent to move away from providing eCommerce sales growth and eCommerce penetration metrics beginning in Q1. Given the circumstances surrounding our temporary store closures, we are continuing to provide these metrics this quarter, and we'll revisit this decision for Q2. And second, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our second quarter 2020 earnings release before the market opens on August 26, 2020, with our subsequent earnings call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, on behalf of all of us here at DICK'S Sporting Goods, we hope each of you and your families are safe and healthy. We would all agree that this has been a difficult year so far for our country. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by COVID-19 and the civil unrest going on across America. These events have shined a spotlight on the deep-rooted and long-standing issues around racial injustice and inequality in the country. \n All of this is happening while our world is still grappling with the dramatic and continuous change as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Virtually every business segment, including the retail industry and DICK'S Sporting Goods, has been affected. Organized sports at all levels have come to a standstill. Gyms and fitness centers were closed across the country, forcing everyone to build new fitness habits and routines. Throughout this evolving landscape, we anchor to our corporate values on the premise that doing the right thing is the ultimate path to success. \n Our company has a long tradition of promoting the safety and welfare of our teammates, athletes and communities, and our response to the current health crisis was no exception. This is why on March 18, we supported the nationwide efforts to minimize the spread of the virus and temporarily closed our stores to the public. To take care of our teammates, we invested $34 million in the first quarter across a number of compensation and safety measures. Beginning in mid-March, through the balance of the first quarter, from a business standpoint, we've focused nearly exclusively on managing for liquidity to ensure we came through this crisis in a strong financial position. We acted quickly and decisively to reduce, defer and eliminate cash outflows, and we maximized cash inflows through our eCommerce business.  \n To fortify our balance sheet and provide maximum financial flexibility, we exercised the accordion feature on our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity to $1.855 billion, and we issued convertible senior notes that added over $500 million of net proceeds to our cash position. As a result of these actions, I'm pleased to report at the end of the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 billion, and we feel very good about our liquidity. \n Throughout the store closures, we continued to serve our athletes online and through our mobile apps. Our eCommerce sales were tremendous, increasing more than 200% since we closed our stores through the end of the first quarter and notably contributing to our strong liquidity position. Importantly, these strong online results have continued into the second quarter, even in those markets where our stores have reopened. A key part of this success online is our new Curbside Pickup service. Under Lauren's leadership, our stores, eCommerce and technology teams came together and launched this new initiative across most of the country within a matter of days. Lauren will cover this in greater detail during her remarks. \n As for our stores, beginning in mid-April, we started to reopen where permitted in accordance with federal, state and local guidelines. As the end of May -- as at the end of May, approximately 80% of our stores have reopened to the public, and we've been pleased with the early results. Although the business environment of 2020 remains uncertain, DICK'S Sporting Goods is in a position of strength. We believe coming out of this crisis, health and fitness will become even more important to the customer. As the leader in sporting goods retail sector, our relationships with our key brands have never been stronger, and we are in a great place to support this demand. \n Our experienced management team has a history of successfully navigating difficult market cycles and remains fully committed to managing our business with a long-term view. Perhaps most importantly, our balance sheet is strong, and due to the actions we've taken when the pandemic first hit, we have enhanced liquidity to emerge from this crisis in even stronger competitive position.  Now with the confidence in our liquidity and our stores reopening, we can turn our attention to gaining market share for the remainder of 2020 and positioning our business for profitable growth in 2021. \n Finally, I would like to thank our teammates. Through these difficult times, I'm especially proud of how they came through and came together to support one another and the company as a whole. I would now like to turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our teammates for their hard work and dedication over the past several months. We've been incredibly impressed with how you've committed to serve our athletes and continued to serve communities. You've done a tremendous job responding to the constantly changing landscape. \n Through March 10, our consolidated same-store sales increased 7.9%, which was a clear indication that our strategies were working. Shortly thereafter, our strong sales trends abruptly changed as the spread of the virus accelerated, and on March 18, we closed our stores to the public.  \n For the quarter, our online sales increased 110%, including Curbside Contactless Pickup. This strength in eCommerce increased significantly after we closed our stores as online sales grew 210% since then through the end of the quarter. We continued to leverage our store network for ship-from-store and Curbside Pickup, while also fulfilling orders via our eCommerce fulfillment centers and distribution centers as well as directly from our vendors. Importantly, our vast fulfillment network seamlessly supported the significant increase in eCommerce volume, and our ability to leverage these many fulfillment methods helped us to continue to reduce shipping times to our athletes. \n We executed our new Curbside initiative within days as our stores, eCommerce and technology teams quickly helped us pivot our business and ensure that we were able to provide our athletes with a safe and convenient way to pick up their orders while reducing shipping and packaging expenses. This is a great reflection of our culture and our nimble operating model and a huge credit goes out to those teams. The athlete response has been overwhelmingly positive. Curbside sales were up 1,000% since its launch through the end of the quarter when you compare it to BOPIS sales in the prior year, and Curbside accounted for over 40% of our total eCommerce sales during this time period. We believe this experience will continue to be a big opportunity for us as we move forward. \n Now let me turn to the stores. By the end of the first quarter, we had reopened approximately 20% of our stores. And as of the end of May, approximately 80% of our stores have reopened. We expect to continue opening our remaining stores throughout the rest of Q2 and into Q3. As we reopen, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes is our highest priority, and we're following the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as federal, state and local authorities. As part of these efforts, we've enhanced our sanitizing protocols and are requiring face covering to be worn by all teammates. We're also requiring our teammates sanitize their hands regularly or wear gloves.  Next, we're communicating, supporting and enabling social distancing. This includes using floor details throughout the store and plexiglass screens at checkout as well as limiting the number of people in the store where applicable by local ordinance. And lastly, we're taking steps to minimize contact, including continuing to offer Curbside Pickup. These actions are being supported by teammate and athlete communication tools aimed at reinforcing healthy habits in addition to wellness protocols to ensure teammates are working only when healthy. \n As Ed mentioned, to date, we've been very pleased with the early results in our stores that have reopened, where we've seen a progressive recovery in sales and traffic. In fact, since reopening, many stores have comped positive on a brick-and-mortar basis. Furthermore, our online sales, including Curbside Pickup, have remained very strong, even in those markets where we've reopened our stores. We're regaining momentum and through the first 4 weeks of Q2, with 44% of our stores remaining closed on average, our consolidated same-store sales have decreased only 4%. As part of this, eCommerce sales have increased momentum and are over 250%. \n In closing, we believe our teammates and athletes will have new expectations related to their working and shopping experiences, and we're certain that the actions we're taking to build trust and to create confidence in these new experiences will pay off for the long term. Along with Ed, I remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods. \n I will now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 30.6% to approximately $1.33 billion. Consolidated same-store sales decreased 29.5%, driven by a 38.7% decrease in transactions and was partially offset by a 9.2% increase in average ticket. We saw declines in each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear.  \n As Lauren mentioned, prior to the impact of COVID-19, we were very pleased with our comp sales performance. And through March 10, our consolidated same-store sales increased 7.9%, a continuation of the strong comp trends we delivered in the second half of 2019. Shortly thereafter, we saw a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand due to the continued spread of the virus, and we closed all of our stores.  \n We were able to partially offset the negative sales impact from our store closures through a significant acceleration in our eCommerce business, including Curbside Contactless Pickup. For the quarter, our eCommerce sales grew 110% and as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 39% compared to 13% last year.  \n Gross profit in the first quarter was $219.3 million or 16.45% of net sales, a 1,290 basis point decline compared to the same period last year. Within gross profit, we saw a deleverage on fixed occupancy costs of 526 basis points due to the sales decline. It's important to note that while we have successfully negotiated payment term deferrals and rent abatements, this didn't materially affect the P&L in Q1 as deferrals don't change the total cash payments, and abatements are spread over the remaining life of the lease. We also saw lower merchandise margins, which decreased by 475 basis points and were primarily driven by sales mix; higher promotions, particularly early in the quarter; and a $28 million write-down of inventory resulting from our temporary store closures. \n Finally, we saw higher shipping expenses and eCommerce fulfillment costs as a result of our meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth as well as the fixed costs associated with our 2 new dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers that \topened in the third quarter last year. \n SG&A expenses were $403.2 million or 30.24% of net sales, up 494 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results. Again, that was due to the sales decline. However, SG&A dollars decreased $83 million compared to last year. This includes approximately $90 million reduction in expenses following our temporary store closures and was partially offset by $31 million of incremental teammate compensation and safety costs. Within the $90 million reduction in expenses, included $21 million of income associated with changes in the company's deferred comp plan for investment values for which the corresponding investment loss was recognized in other expense. \n In total, we recorded a loss per diluted share of $1.71 compared to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 last year. \n Since the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases in mid-March, we acted quickly and decisively to preserve cash and fortify our balance sheet. Collectively, these actions have bolstered our cash and cash equivalents to approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, and we had $214 million of additional borrowing capacity on our line of credit. \n Let's walk through the details. First, we meaningfully reduced cash expenses across the business, including marketing, travel, contractors and within payroll through salary reductions and furloughs of a significant number of our teammates across our stores, distribution centers and customer support center. Concurrent with the reopening of the majority of our stores, last week, we restored previously reduced salaries for our teammates, except for certain executives, and have started bringing teammates back from furlough. We have also had very productive discussions with our vendors to reduce inventory receipts and extend payment terms. Likewise, we've had similarly productive discussions with our landlords about deferring and abating rent payments.  \n Additionally, we completed the issuance of $575 million of 3.25% convertible senior notes due in 2025, which includes a full exercise of the $75 million overallotment option. These notes provide for an initial conversion option once our stock price reaches $35.38 per share, and thus dilution would typically occur when our stock price exceeds this threshold. However, in conjunction with the notes issuance, we entered into stock hedge transactions to reduce the dilution from shares issuable upon conversion of the notes. The hedge transactions will provide economic dilution protection upon maturity of the notes if our stock is trading at or between $35.38 and $52.42, the aggregate net proceeds from the issuance and the sale of notes were approximately $558 million or approximately $502 million net of the note hedge. \n Due to current accounting rules, we have discounted the value of the notes on the balance sheet to $398 million as of the end of the first quarter. This discount will be amortized as noncash interest expense resulting in a total annualized interest rate of 11.6% on the discounted value of the notes. We also exercised the accordion feature on our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity from $1.6 billion to $1.855 billion and ended the first quarter with approximately $1.4 billion outstanding. \n Finally, we made meaningful modifications to our 2020 capital allocation plan. This includes significant reductions to our planned capital expenditures. We also temporarily suspended our quarterly dividend as well as our share repurchase program. As our business continues to stabilize, we may resume opportunistic share repurchases under our current authorizations. \n For the first quarter, net capital expenditures were $51 million, and we paid $28 million in quarterly dividends, which was declared prior to the suspension. We did not repurchase any shares. Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 2% compared to the end of the same period last year. And working alongside our brands, we acted decisively to reduce, defer and cancel planned receipts to align with our new sales forecast. For the rest of 2020, we are conservatively planning our inventory receipts. However, we have plenty of liquidity as well as strong relationships with our vendors if we need to opportunistically chase products.\n With respect to our outlook, there's a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of several key external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders and economic stimulus, as well as employment and consumer confidence and their potential impact on our business. Given this uncertainty, we do not believe it is appropriate to provide a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, we move forward with confidence, we have ample liquidity and are pleased with our market position as well as our Q2 sales trends. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Robby Ohmes with BofA Securities. \nRobert Ohmes: I think the question everybody wants to ask is if -- could we get a little more color on the first 4 weeks? It's great that you gave us the down 4% comps. But how should we think about getting there in terms of depending on -- sort of maybe some color on how the reopened stores, if you just isolate those, how are they performing? And also, how does eCommerce and Curbside Contactless Pickup change when you reopen stores? Any more color you can give on those 4 weeks would be great. And then I have a follow-up question. \nEdward Stack: So Robby, I think -- a couple things. The stores that have opened are doing very well. As Lauren said, many of them -- most of them are comping positively. So we're really pleased with that. And the Curbside Pickup, Lauren, you can talk about that, but that's still doing really well. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. No, the penetration of Curbside Pickup continues on. And Robby, I think the way to think about it is, we were down 4%, we had 44% of our stores on average closed during that period. And so if you do the math, you can say that we're very pleased with how the stores are performing when they reopen. \nRobert Ohmes: Should we assume the closed stores are -- the stores that are still closed are comping kind of similar to what you put up for the first quarter? Or... \nLee Belitsky: Well, if they're closed, we're not recording any brick-and-mortar sales in it, but we are continuing to do Curbside Pickup. Curbside Pickup, we're including within our eCommerce sales. \nEdward Stack: The stores are doing very well, Robby, and they're comping positively, the majority of them that we've opened up. And then the eCommerce business is still doing very well. I wouldn't want to get ahead of yourself to think that with 40% of the stores closed we're comping positively from -- the stores that are open are making up for those stores that are closed, that's not the case. They're doing extremely well. We couldn't be more pleased with how they're comping, but the Curbside Pickup and the eCommerce business continues to be very strong even in the markets where we've reopened. \nRobert Ohmes: Got it. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question. Just the -- how should we think about potential further write-downs going forward? And Ed, maybe how should we think about different seasons? We're moving into the second quarter here. How could that be different from the first quarter in terms of categories that may or may not pressure you, like team sports? \nEdward Stack: Yes. Team sports is the one that we're most concerned about from a go-forward sales standpoint. It depends on -- we don't know if the kids are going to play football this fall or if they're going to play soccer this fall. Some of the -- those are primarily school sports, especially on the football side. Baseball is starting to open up in some markets, which are more of municipal leagues and travel leagues. And where baseball has opened up, it's doing very well. But team sports is where we're most concerned and have kind of the least amount of visibility to what's going to happen going forward. \nRobert Ohmes: Congrats on getting that Curbside Pickup going.  That's a really amazing execution. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Robby. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: The first question I had was just in terms of the change in product demand, how that's changed over time. I assume there was a lot of fitness-type equipment being sold during the shelter-in-place. But in the last 4 weeks, just wondering if you're seeing any strength in other categories. You mentioned baseball. Wondered if there was any other trends that were emerging.\n And then my second question is just about how you're thinking when it comes to the back half of the year? And what level of promotions you could possibly expect because of what we're entering into? \nEdward Stack: So Kate, the trends have changed a little. But you're right, the fitness business was really a very big part of the business when we -- when the stores closed and the pandemic first hit. And that's still pretty good. We're struggling to keep in stock in that product, although we've got some product down the road. We think we're going to be fine. The bike business was very good. But kind of the businesses that have started to pick up, the footwear business is very good. The apparel business is very good. The golf business has been very good since the golf courses got opened up. So all in all, it's been pretty good. The -- baseball, where they have started to play baseball, has been very good. They're still not playing baseball in a lot of different places. We're starting to see -- we've got a good look into the baseball business from our GameChanger app, and we're starting to see a lot more baseball games being played and scored on a weekly basis. That's growing at a pretty rapid rate. So we're pretty confident going forward. But there are still a lot of places where they're not playing baseball yet. But overall, the footwear business, apparel business, golf business and the outdoor business still continues to be very good. \nLauren Hobart: And the second question about the level of promotions in the back half. \nEdward Stack: Oh, yes. I don't know yet. None of us do. We think it will probably be a tad more promotional because people have inventory to get rid of. But we're -- our inventory is in very good position. I mean, I think a lot of people were surprised to see our inventory actually down 2% in the -- at the end of the quarter. So we're in a pretty good position. I think it will be a little bit more promotional, but I don't think it's going to be too bad. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So Ed, has this situation permanently changed DICK'S Sporting Goods' margin structure? And as part of that, can you comment on what the puts and takes are going to be into the second half that we should factor as we're modeling the business? \nLee Belitsky: So Michael, it's Lee. I think with respect to the margin structure, and I gather you're talking about operating margins, if we continue these trends where we're getting the brick-and-mortar sales back up and running and they're getting back up and running well, the profitability of that channel is strong. And our eCommerce business has continued to grow. It hasn't been terribly promotional, frankly, on the eCommerce channel. And we've increased the Curbside Contactless Pickup, which eliminates the shipping and packaging expense. And if we're able to maintain a high penetration of that, the profitability of our eCommerce business should improve as well. So it all depends how it's going to mix out. I think in aggregate it's a good picture for profitability going forward, for total profits. What it does to the profit margin line, it's really going to depend on how it mixes out between eCom and brick-and-mortar stores. But if we can keep those brick-and-mortar stores rolling along at -- with respectable comps, our profit picture should be pretty solid going forward. \nEdward Stack: And the merchandising margin rates from an eCom standpoint are actually running ahead right now. \nMichael Lasser: So just to clarify few of those points. Are the merch margin rates running ahead in part because of this lack of promotions? And do you expect that promotions will resume at some point; this is a pretty unique period? Also, if you don't see -- if this resurgence in the brick-and-mortar business is more temporary, can you frame what the impact from the mix shift to eCommerce is going to be? It looks like there was about 300 basis points of drag from increased shipping costs in the quarter. How much of that would be just kind of temporary? And then also, as part of that, can you frame out how are you thinking about occupancy? You're going to be benefiting from a very radically different landscape from a real estate perspective. Shouldn't that help you be able to leverage occupancy costs at a much lower comp than you have seemed to leverage on in the past \nLee Belitsky: So with regard to eCommerce, so we do have some drag on the gross margin due to the additional shipping costs. But I don't expect the eCom penetration to remain at 39% of the business as it was in Q1. If we get our brick-and-mortar sales back and eCom stays at 39%, then we'll all be happy. But I don't expect that it's going to stay that high. And I think that even though we had significant savings from Curbside Pickup, it couldn't impact -- it couldn't offset the full impact of going to 39% penetration on -- from a gross margin perspective. \n With regard to lease -- occupancy expense, I think there will be opportunities -- continue to be opportunities to drive down our occupancy expenses, to reduce our rent expense. We do have north of 100 leases coming up for renewal each year, and we're aggressively renegotiating those leases as we go forward. And we expect to continue to have opportunities there. \nLauren Hobart: Michael, I would -- it's Lauren. I would just add that I think in this omnichannel world, which we clearly lived in for the last 10 weeks, where the only way a consumer could place an order was online and the stores became a huge part of the fulfillment, they always were, but even a bigger part of our fulfillment and our demand driving, we really need to rethink what a sale is and what the profitability and flow-through is all the way through the P&L because the stores are such an integral part of what the eCommerce delivered over the last 10 weeks. It's very, very merged at this point. \nLee Belitsky: Yes, without the stores, we don't have the Curbside Pickup. So that's becoming a growing consideration in how much real estate we need. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So first a question, follow-up on the gross margin. You mentioned some, I think, promotions earlier in the quarter. I think that was when you had strong comps. So if you can just give a little color there of what drove that pressure? And then I have a follow-up. \nLee Belitsky: I think shortly after we closed the stores, we were in a scenario where nobody knew what was going to happen, how long the stores were going to be closed, if it was going to be weeks, months, nobody knew. So we were pretty aggressive with promotions online in those first couple of weeks after we closed. And we were also still clearing out a little bit of the winter merchandise early in the quarter because we didn't have much cold weather, so we were clearing through some of that remaining winter merchandise in stores even before we closed. \nChristopher Horvers: Makes sense. So as you look forward on the SG&A line, can you just share some color in terms of how we think about the savings going forward, to what extent are you bringing -- are you -- as you open a store, do you bring back all the furloughed employees of those stores? Or are you sort of cascading them in as the business builds back up? How are you thinking about the marketing expense in the second and third quarter as well, and any other color would be appreciated? \nLee Belitsky: The sales have been strong in the stores as we've opened them. So we're bringing back the lion's share of the furloughed associates in the stores as they open. We are taking them on a store-by-store basis because they're not all performing equally. But we do have -- we had in Q1 and into Q2 some extra expenses in the store. We have continued with our Hero Pay program where we are increasing -- temporarily increasing the hourly pay in stores and distribution centers by 15%. That's going to continue for a little while. We haven't determined yet when we're going -- that's going to end. We are -- we do have extra payroll going into cleaning, sanitizing stores, wiping things down, wiping off the shopping carts and so on. So there's actually some extra payroll in the stores right now as we get through COVID. So I would expect that as the stores open, we would incur additional payroll expense for a while in the stores versus what we have in the past. And we experienced that at the end of Q1 as we started to open the stores, and we will experience that well into Q2. \n With regard to admin expenses, we have open positions right now. We'll be cautious as to hiring back to those open positions until we really see what's happening with the business. And we noted that we've restored -- as of the fourth week of May, we restored the pay reductions to almost all the associates, except for a few of the senior executives in the company. As we got to the point where we had 70%, 80% of the stores opened, we restored their pay. So we still have some meaningful savings coming in travel and contractors and -- but we do have extra expenses we're incurring as well. \nChristopher Horvers: And then just lastly, are you at this point planning marketing down in the second quarter? And then similarly, just from a promotional perspective, you exited clean. So are you just waiting to see what happens in the environment at this point given the strength in sales and the clean -- how clean the inventory is, so the promotional is probably a positive so far. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. It's Lauren. Starting with the marketing, we definitely -- we were -- we cut back significantly when the COVID stores -- when the stores were closed, and we have re-upped it. And we're actually feeling very bullish on the back half of the year in terms of the spend and generating the consumer demand. So we are turning on the marketing, obviously, within reason and doing it in a phased approach. And then, Ed, you want to mention about the inventory? \nEdward Stack: Yes. We're -- we feel great about our inventory position. We're chasing inventory. We're actually buying some off-price inventory from some of the brands that for whatever reason they have available. So we're really happy with our inventory position. We're happy with kind of our margin rates going forward and what we have visibility to margin rates on a go-forward basis. We're cautiously optimistic. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congrats on the performance. Ed, I guess one of my first question is, pre-COVID, DICK'S was one of the few retailers that were still sort of looking to open stores, albeit at a slower pace. I'm wondering how this current crisis sort of impacts that. And as a follow-on to that, you're very prescient with your kind of digital investments since 2017. What are the next evolutionary sort of IT investments, whether that's contactless checkout or things you're thinking about kind of the future store? \nEdward Stack: Sure. So new stores, we've slowed the growth down a little bit. We pushed some of the stores that we're going to open this year into next year. And we'll assess the marketplace, and we'll assess what's going on from a real estate standpoint on a go-forward basis. \n As far as IT investments, we continue to invest in technology. We continue to invest in what we're going to do from a Curbside Pickup, footwear app that we're talking about. So we've got -- we continue to invest from a technology standpoint. And Lauren, you've got a couple of other things? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I think, Adrienne, you're absolutely right. The investments over the past few years, which really were meant to enable us to scale productively, all came to very positive fruition over the past several weeks. And the new consumer environment has definitely accelerated some of our pushes for innovation. We will be -- we're looking at the entire customer experience, the entire customer journey, how to provide more contactless experiences even in the store when people are shopping, whether that's our ShoeRunner app that we've tried right now where people can sort of self-help themselves, which is providing a ton of different opportunities there. Mobile will be a big piece for us going forward. So if anything, this has incredibly energized our innovation efforts and our technology teams behind the changing landscape. \nLee Belitsky: One thing is we also improved our delivery performance during the quarter versus last year. So notwithstanding the big increase in sales that we had, we took about half day off of our average delivery time from the same period last year. So we continue to make improvements there. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: And then, Lee, just a quick one for you. How should we think about, I know this is a big question, 2Q sales. And the reason I ask that is the sustainability of the May trend. People are talking about kind of summer vacations.  They're more staycation, more outdoors. It feels like the things that are driving May performance, some of those drivers are unlike some of the investing or some of the onetime pent-up demand. It seems like they may -- could get stronger as we go into the summer. So just wondering how we should think about some of the drivers of early May. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. It's hard to say how it's going to play out. It could get stronger, but it could be some that was pulled forward as well because the kids are out of school and people are working from home. So they may have got into some of the summer purchases early. So it's a little hard to say on those summer trends how it's going to play out. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, I want to ask you, Ed. There was a comment about market share in the press release. And I think it was a couple years back, when Sports Authority were closing, you made a clear message about going after share. I guess, first, is it clear that you didn't gain in Q1? And then in the comment that you made in the release, are you approaching this next few quarters in a similar way you looked at 2016, 2017? And any read across to how the business should be managed from a financial perspective? \nEdward Stack: Well, we're going -- we think we've got great relationships with our vendors. We think our inventory is in terrific shape. The trajectory that we were on from basically Q2 of last year through even Q1 of this year before we closed the stores and the trend that we see that were picking up with the stores that are opening, we're pretty confident from the changes that we made from a merchandising standpoint, where our brand is in the eyes of the consumer, that we'll continue to pick up market share. And I believe that we're going to continue to pick up market share. \n We put ourselves in a great financial position to be able to go out and aggressively buy product off-price right now. We've put ourselves in a position that we don't have to cut back on our marketing effort. We can go in from a marketing standpoint and drive consumers into our store, whether it's in the brick-and-mortar stores, whether it's from an online standpoint to Curbside Pickup or when it's a more traditional online business. So we've made some big changes to the merchandise that we carry. We've made some big changes to how we are approaching things in the store from a service standpoint. We've made some big changes into how we're marketing our business. And I think if you take a look at last year and what our comp sales were versus others, we picked up market share, and we feel that we are continuing that trend, especially as the stores start to reopen. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I just want to add on to that for a moment that comparing it to 2016, '17 and TSA feels a little different from how we're thinking about it now, which is, it's not about our brick-and-mortar competitors going under; it's about us gaining market share and gaining new customers and gathering customers to try our online business who had never tried it before. So it's just -- it's a different compare. I just wanted to point that out. It's not -- it's different, and it's actually very exciting. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up. This relates to something that Lee and Lauren commented on, the merging of the 2 channels. And I know it's harder to look at profitability separately. My question is and was going to be, if you look at the business a year from now, are we closer to -- are we much closer to an equilibrium in profitability between the 2 channels? And again, I appreciate it's harder to look at them separate. But I think in getting to sustainable profitable growth, I don't know if that is a prerequisite or not? \nEdward Stack: I think it does get to being closer, especially as we're seeing the Curbside Pickup not slow down and our stores continue to comp positively. So as eCommerce picks up from a Curbside standpoint, as Lee and Lauren have both said, it gets to be more profitable because of the shipping and packaging changes. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. \nFrederick Gaertner: This is Will on for Sam. So my first question is on eCommerce. And I realize you guys are not guiding here. But I mean how big you think the eCommerce business could be this year? I mean do you think it could be a $2 billion-plus business this year? \nLee Belitsky: Well, Will, as you said, we're not guiding to that. But we're really pleased with the momentum we've got and hope we can keep it up. \nEdward Stack: And we suspect we can. But we're not going to go out on a limb and tell you what we think the numbers are right now. We'll let you know at the end of the fourth quarter, okay? \nFrederick Gaertner: Fair enough, fair enough. And how much do you think -- I know you said stores are comping positive that have opened. How much do you think that the eCommerce business is cannibalizing stores? \nEdward Stack: Right now, very little. A lot of the eCommerce pickup we've got are from new customers. \nFrederick Gaertner: And that's a good segue. I guess how many customers in 1Q do you think that you guys acquired and were put into the loyalty program? \nEdward Stack: Yes. We're not going to get to that level of granularity right now, but there's a meaningful amount of the customers that we serve from an eCom standpoint, whether it be pickup -- Curbside Pickup or a more traditional eCommerce customer, there was a meaningful number of new customers that we picked up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on the quarter-to-date performance, the stores that have reopened, the positive results that you're seeing. Is it sort of like an initial surge and then the trend steps back down? Or have you seen some level of consistency or even an acceleration through this period in those stores that have reopened? And then sort of unrelated, but the point on team sports, that is obviously a risk ahead. There's some uncertainty. Any way for you guys to size up the exposure? And what could be the impact from some limitations in the back half of the year? \nEdward Stack: From a store standpoint, I'd say it's been consistent. And we think as we start to get in some additional products, some fitness products and bike products and boat products that's been really very good, it could accelerate. But it's been pretty consistent. And in the fourth quarter, back half of the year, we're not going to get into talking about that. We're not providing any guidance. We'll have to wait and see what happens. I mean is there a second wave? Is -- some of the issues facing the country today, do they continue? So it's really difficult to get out that far. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. Fair enough. Just a follow-up on the online business. Can you guys give us the percent of online sales that actually touch the store today, whether that's ship-from-store or pickup and how that compares to maybe a year ago? Clearly, the model is evolving here. And then just regarding pickup, any more color on the types of categories that are being picked up and if it's different than the typical mix? \nLee Belitsky: So again, a meaningful kind of majority of the sales are -- come out of our stores, whether it be Curbside or ship-from-store. Mix, fortunately, is a little bit more skewed towards some of the bigger, bulkier items that are more expensive to ship, and that's kind of favorable from an earnings perspective to do that from the stores. \nLauren Hobart: It continues to increase. It's been more than half for some time that touch the stores in some way, our eCommerce business. And obviously with the surge in Curbside, that increased. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Mike Baker with Nomura. \nMichael Baker: Can you talk about, if you think the stimulus helped? And I guess part of that question would be, any more color on sort of the pace of business through April? We can sort of back into what the last 7.5 weeks comped out, but I'm sure they weren't consistent across that period. My guess is, like a lot of other retailers, you saw things progress through the end of March and into April, helped by the stimulus or weather or whatever the case may be. But if you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful. \nLee Belitsky: The eCommerce business has been building. And as we have opened stores, obviously, our store sales have been building. Some of that is timed in connection with when the stimulus checks arrived. But the stimulus checks arrived going out a month ago and the business continues to be good now. But stimulus checks probably helped. It's hard to measure it. But we're still encouraged with where the business is now. \nMichael Baker: Okay. That's helpful. A couple of other follow-ups. You said you're buying off-price right now. Is that product that you -- can you get that product in the stores this season? Or does some of that get packed away? \nEdward Stack: The majority of it will be in the stores this season. We may have some buys that we might pack away to use for next year, but the vast majority of it will be in stores this year. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Interesting. And then one more sort of follow-up as it relates to inventory. And I don't know if you're prepared to answer this, but as you're putting in inventory now, and as you said, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there. I mean how do you think about the risk of building inventory right now? And particularly as we get into back-to-school and some schools might not be going back in a normal fashion in September. And I could also ask about licensed apparel, is there risk there if we don't have college football or World Series or those types of things? \nEdward Stack: We're making the best decisions we can with the information that we've got. And we are being -- we're probably being more cautious than we are aggressive. There are certain categories that we think are going to be very good and we're aggressive on. So as an example, we continue to be very aggressive in the fitness category. We continue to be very aggressive in the bike category. We'll be very aggressive in the athletic footwear category, especially around running, as people coming out of this pandemic are really starting to realize that one of the great ways to be healthy is to be in shape and to be stronger. And we think we're in a great lane to help service that consumer who's looking to do that. So we're going to be very aggressive in some areas. \n And from a license standpoint around college football and some of the pro sports, depending on how things play out, we're not nearly as aggressive. So we're trying to make the right decisions based on the information we have. And like I said, some places we're being aggressive and other places we're pulling back. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Another store footprint question. And I think we all understand, you can't have Curbside Pickup without your stores, but does the growth in eCom and Curbside potentially push you to reevaluate the specific role of each of your stores? In other words, do they all have to be the same size, same configuration, et cetera, that they are today? \nEdward Stack: We don't see any change in what we're looking at from a store standpoint. We talked most recently about how we are trying to reduce space allocation, how we're trying to continue to focus on the team sport athlete. And although that team sport athlete, that baseball player, football player, soccer player may be constrained right now, that's not going to be in perpetuity, that they'll be back. And if it's not this fall or next spring, they will be back. So we think that's an important part of our business. As we continue to make changes to our footwear department and broaden the products that we carry in footwear or what we're doing in athletic apparel or in our women's business, I mean, right now, our largest -- our second and third largest brands in women's athletic apparel are CALIA and the new DSG brand. So we don't think that there's a big change. And one of the things with Curbside, we need to have the product that make -- if people want Curbside, they want to pick it up that day. And in order to have the inventory available to them, we need to have these stores. So it may not be very popular with people that don't truly understand our business, but we're very comfortable with the -- with our store configuration right now. \nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then just a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify something, I think, Lee said. Have sales actually continued to accelerate as we've moved further away from the distribution of the stimulus funds? Is that what the inference was like? \nLee Belitsky: Well the eCommerce, we talked about the eCommerce business in May being up north of 250%. It was 210% in the back half of Q1. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: Two questions. First, just on the -- can you give us an update on the status of the hunt clearance and exit? Did that have any material impact on that product margin number in 1Q? And related to that, kind of that outdoor theme that's out there in the marketplace, just any other areas of the store where you're seeing that play out? That's my first question. \nEdward Stack: Yes. So on the space allocation, we slowed that down right now based on the capital. We cut back on our CapEx budget pretty significantly. So that's been slowed down a little bit. As far as the outdoor categories, those outdoor categories have continued to be pretty good. We continue to comp positively in those areas. \nPeter Benedict: Okay. And just pivoting over to SG&A, just to follow up on those. Two questions. One, I mean as we think about SG&A was down 17% in the first quarter year-over-year, sounds like you're adding back store employees, you're bringing back some marketing, how should we think about SG&A in the second quarter as you sit here today? Would you still expect it to be down year-over-year? And then that $34 million of COVID expense that kind of hit SG&A in the first quarter, call it, a $20 million to $23 million monthly run rate, does that just continue through 2Q and in the back half of the year or are there parts of that, that start to come off? \nLee Belitsky: I mean there are parts of that, that come off because we're not paying people that aren't working anymore. And we had 3 weeks of paying people that weren't working. So that piece comes off, at least in the stores, and we're returning people from furlough. But as I said earlier, we are going to have increased expenses associated with running the stores because we largely had to bring back pretty much most, if not all, of our store associates because the sales trends have been pretty solid there. And we have extra expenses for the hourly workers of 15% and extra hours we've got in the stores to do regular cleaning as well. So we will continue to have some savings from people that are -- folks that are still furloughed at this point. We'll have some savings from lower expenses in May. And we're not aggressively hiring back open positions right now. So we'll have some savings associated with that, but we're going to have some extra costs, too. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Tom Nikic of Wells Fargo. \nTom Nikic: I wanted to ask, over the last couple years, you've made a lot of investments in the in-store experience, batting cages, the elevated in-store service levels. With new requirements around sort of safety, social distancing, et cetera, does that create any sort of impediments to some of those experiences that you've worked to add to the store? \nLauren Hobart: Tom, yes. So when we first closed the stores and right prior to that, we pretty much shut down all of those experiential elements in the store, be it the batting cages or the golf simulators. But we have now been working very hard over the last several weeks to figure out ways to continue those experiences in a safe manner. We've turned back on golf fittings. We are able to do it in a way that we believe is very safe for both our teammates and our athletes. And same with the baseball simulator. So we actually have adapted fairly well, and there seems to be consumer demand to keep those experiences going. \nTom Nikic: All right. Sounds good. And Lee, a question for you. Obviously, to shore up some of the liquidity, you did a convertible debt raise, and you also borrowed quite a bit on the revolver. Is there a way we should think about the pace of sort of maybe paying down that revolving debt? And I don't know if there's like a certain milestone you want to reach before you start paying down that debt or anything like that, but just from a balance sheet leverage perspective, any help would be appreciated. \nLee Belitsky: Yes. We're in the process of paying down that revolver debt as we go through. I think the worst of our concerns and many concerns around the liquidity crisis that could have possibly occurred from mid-March through mid-April seemed to be behind us. Our business is coming back. Our relationships with our banks are really good. So we're in the process of bringing that down. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel. \nJim Duffy: On Curbside Pickup, what do trends show you with respect to consumers' patience for inventory to be delivered to the store? Is conversion much higher if the inventory is lit up as immediately available in store versus available in a few days or a week? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Right now, the availability that we're presenting is availability that is available in store. \nEdward Stack: Immediately. \nLauren Hobart: I'm sorry, immediately. Yes, that is available to pick up immediately. So the patience has not been a factor. We actually think that's upside.  We can actually have, what we would call, a delayed buy-online-pickup-in-store experience. But we are -- that is something we're working on right now. And just as the patience for the entire order or the process, the whole thing has been taking on average less than 30 minutes and usually closer to 15 minutes to fulfill. So patience is important, but I think we're overdelivering. \nJim Duffy: That's great. And then a question as it relates to the second half of the year. Lot of enthusiasm around reopening right now. Speaking with the vendors, most have been conservative with respect to planned inventory receipts for seasonal categories in the second half. We don't know what back-to-school is going to mean, but it will get cold and there will be a Christmas. Are you concerned that you may not have enough inventory for holidays? Is that part of the thought process at this juncture? \nEdward Stack: I think we're concerned if we'll have enough of the right inventory. We'll then have to kind of go to some second choices and move some market share. But right now we feel pretty confident, we're in pretty good shape. There are some categories and some vendors we'd like to have some additional inventory from that we're moving market share to and we'll see how that goes. But right now, we feel pretty good. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's final question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask a bit more about the consumer. I know it was asked before about the stimulus checks. But what are you seeing from the consumer? I mean, obviously, it seems like there's an appetite for certain parts of the sporting goods. But is it -- are you seeing any differences? Like is there a trade-down within categories? Are people shifting upwards? Or anything that would give you any insight into how the consumer is feeling? Is it just really that once we're past COVID-19, things will start to free up and get better? \nEdward Stack: I don't think we see anything meaningfully different from a trading up or trading down. Some of our -- some categories the average unit retail is actually going up, such as footwear, but that's really got a fair amount to do with the mix that we have. And there's mix differences. As we said, we think the fitness business, the boat business, the bike business, anything that has to do with the outdoors is really -- continues to do extremely well, and we think that will continue going forward. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. And then actually, that was a good segue there, Ed. With regard to the footwear category itself, you've mentioned running a couple of times. Is that really what's driving it right now or how's -- versus basketball or versus style? I know you guys have made a little more investment on that front. Just any color on that would be helpful. \nEdward Stack: Yes. I mean the lifestyle business continues to do extremely well. And so we continue to be enthusiastic about that. But we continue to be really enthusiastic about the running category because as people -- as it started to open up and people are getting out and even a little bit before that, when people could get out in social distance, they were out running, they were out walking, they were out walking and running. And that silhouette, we think, is going to continue to be very good for people trying to get out and get out in the fresh air and get in a little bit better shape of either walking or running. And we don't think that that's going to change anytime soon. We're in a great position to take advantage of that. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ed Stack for any final remarks. \nEdward Stack: I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and we'll look forward to seeing everybody on our next conference call. Thank you. Be safe. \nOperator: Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, on behalf of all of us here at DICK'S Sporting Goods, we hope each of you and your families are safe and healthy. We would all agree that this has been a difficult year so far for our country. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by COVID-19 and the civil unrest going on across America. These events have shined a spotlight on the deep-rooted and long-standing issues around racial injustice and inequality in the country. \n All of this is happening while our world is still grappling with the dramatic and continuous change as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Virtually every business segment, including the retail industry and DICK'S Sporting Goods, has been affected. Organized sports at all levels have come to a standstill. Gyms and fitness centers were closed across the country, forcing everyone to build new fitness habits and routines. Throughout this evolving landscape, we anchor to our corporate values on the premise that doing the right thing is the ultimate path to success. \n Our company has a long tradition of promoting the safety and welfare of our teammates, athletes and communities, and our response to the current health crisis was no exception. This is why on March 18, we supported the nationwide efforts to minimize the spread of the virus and temporarily closed our stores to the public. To take care of our teammates, we invested $34 million in the first quarter across a number of compensation and safety measures. Beginning in mid-March, through the balance of the first quarter, from a business standpoint, we've focused nearly exclusively on managing for liquidity to ensure we came through this crisis in a strong financial position. We acted quickly and decisively to reduce, defer and eliminate cash outflows, and we maximized cash inflows through our eCommerce business.  \n To fortify our balance sheet and provide maximum financial flexibility, we exercised the accordion feature on our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity to $1.855 billion, and we issued convertible senior notes that added over $500 million of net proceeds to our cash position. As a result of these actions, I'm pleased to report at the end of the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 billion, and we feel very good about our liquidity. \n Throughout the store closures, we continued to serve our athletes online and through our mobile apps. Our eCommerce sales were tremendous, increasing more than 200% since we closed our stores through the end of the first quarter and notably contributing to our strong liquidity position. Importantly, these strong online results have continued into the second quarter, even in those markets where our stores have reopened. A key part of this success online is our new Curbside Pickup service. Under Lauren's leadership, our stores, eCommerce and technology teams came together and launched this new initiative across most of the country within a matter of days. Lauren will cover this in greater detail during her remarks. \n As for our stores, beginning in mid-April, we started to reopen where permitted in accordance with federal, state and local guidelines. As the end of May -- as at the end of May, approximately 80% of our stores have reopened to the public, and we've been pleased with the early results. Although the business environment of 2020 remains uncertain, DICK'S Sporting Goods is in a position of strength. We believe coming out of this crisis, health and fitness will become even more important to the customer. As the leader in sporting goods retail sector, our relationships with our key brands have never been stronger, and we are in a great place to support this demand. \n Our experienced management team has a history of successfully navigating difficult market cycles and remains fully committed to managing our business with a long-term view. Perhaps most importantly, our balance sheet is strong, and due to the actions we've taken when the pandemic first hit, we have enhanced liquidity to emerge from this crisis in even stronger competitive position.  Now with the confidence in our liquidity and our stores reopening, we can turn our attention to gaining market share for the remainder of 2020 and positioning our business for profitable growth in 2021. \n Finally, I would like to thank our teammates. Through these difficult times, I'm especially proud of how they came through and came together to support one another and the company as a whole. I would now like to turn the call over to Lauren. So Robby, I think -- a couple things. The stores that have opened are doing very well. As Lauren said, many of them -- most of them are comping positively. So we're really pleased with that. And the Curbside Pickup, Lauren, you can talk about that, but that's still doing really well. The stores are doing very well, Robby, and they're comping positively, the majority of them that we've opened up. And then the eCommerce business is still doing very well. I wouldn't want to get ahead of yourself to think that with 40% of the stores closed we're comping positively from -- the stores that are open are making up for those stores that are closed, that's not the case. They're doing extremely well. We couldn't be more pleased with how they're comping, but the Curbside Pickup and the eCommerce business continues to be very strong even in the markets where we've reopened. Yes. Team sports is the one that we're most concerned about from a go-forward sales standpoint. It depends on -- we don't know if the kids are going to play football this fall or if they're going to play soccer this fall. Some of the -- those are primarily school sports, especially on the football side. Baseball is starting to open up in some markets, which are more of municipal leagues and travel leagues. And where baseball has opened up, it's doing very well. But team sports is where we're most concerned and have kind of the least amount of visibility to what's going to happen going forward. Thanks, Robby. So Kate, the trends have changed a little. But you're right, the fitness business was really a very big part of the business when we -- when the stores closed and the pandemic first hit. And that's still pretty good. We're struggling to keep in stock in that product, although we've got some product down the road. We think we're going to be fine. The bike business was very good. But kind of the businesses that have started to pick up, the footwear business is very good. The apparel business is very good. The golf business has been very good since the golf courses got opened up. So all in all, it's been pretty good. The -- baseball, where they have started to play baseball, has been very good. They're still not playing baseball in a lot of different places. We're starting to see -- we've got a good look into the baseball business from our GameChanger app, and we're starting to see a lot more baseball games being played and scored on a weekly basis. That's growing at a pretty rapid rate. So we're pretty confident going forward. But there are still a lot of places where they're not playing baseball yet. But overall, the footwear business, apparel business, golf business and the outdoor business still continues to be very good. Oh, yes. I don't know yet. None of us do. We think it will probably be a tad more promotional because people have inventory to get rid of. But we're -- our inventory is in very good position. I mean, I think a lot of people were surprised to see our inventory actually down 2% in the -- at the end of the quarter. So we're in a pretty good position. I think it will be a little bit more promotional, but I don't think it's going to be too bad. And the merchandising margin rates from an eCom standpoint are actually running ahead right now. Yes. We're -- we feel great about our inventory position. We're chasing inventory. We're actually buying some off-price inventory from some of the brands that for whatever reason they have available. So we're really happy with our inventory position. We're happy with kind of our margin rates going forward and what we have visibility to margin rates on a go-forward basis. We're cautiously optimistic. Sure. So new stores, we've slowed the growth down a little bit. We pushed some of the stores that we're going to open this year into next year. And we'll assess the marketplace, and we'll assess what's going on from a real estate standpoint on a go-forward basis. \n As far as IT investments, we continue to invest in technology. We continue to invest in what we're going to do from a Curbside Pickup, footwear app that we're talking about. So we've got -- we continue to invest from a technology standpoint. And Lauren, you've got a couple of other things? Well, we're going -- we think we've got great relationships with our vendors. We think our inventory is in terrific shape. The trajectory that we were on from basically Q2 of last year through even Q1 of this year before we closed the stores and the trend that we see that were picking up with the stores that are opening, we're pretty confident from the changes that we made from a merchandising standpoint, where our brand is in the eyes of the consumer, that we'll continue to pick up market share. And I believe that we're going to continue to pick up market share. \n We put ourselves in a great financial position to be able to go out and aggressively buy product off-price right now. We've put ourselves in a position that we don't have to cut back on our marketing effort. We can go in from a marketing standpoint and drive consumers into our store, whether it's in the brick-and-mortar stores, whether it's from an online standpoint to Curbside Pickup or when it's a more traditional online business. So we've made some big changes to the merchandise that we carry. We've made some big changes to how we are approaching things in the store from a service standpoint. We've made some big changes into how we're marketing our business. And I think if you take a look at last year and what our comp sales were versus others, we picked up market share, and we feel that we are continuing that trend, especially as the stores start to reopen. I think it does get to being closer, especially as we're seeing the Curbside Pickup not slow down and our stores continue to comp positively. So as eCommerce picks up from a Curbside standpoint, as Lee and Lauren have both said, it gets to be more profitable because of the shipping and packaging changes. And we suspect we can. But we're not going to go out on a limb and tell you what we think the numbers are right now. We'll let you know at the end of the fourth quarter, okay? Right now, very little. A lot of the eCommerce pickup we've got are from new customers. Yes. We're not going to get to that level of granularity right now, but there's a meaningful amount of the customers that we serve from an eCom standpoint, whether it be pickup -- Curbside Pickup or a more traditional eCommerce customer, there was a meaningful number of new customers that we picked up. From a store standpoint, I'd say it's been consistent. And we think as we start to get in some additional products, some fitness products and bike products and boat products that's been really very good, it could accelerate. But it's been pretty consistent. And in the fourth quarter, back half of the year, we're not going to get into talking about that. We're not providing any guidance. We'll have to wait and see what happens. I mean is there a second wave? Is -- some of the issues facing the country today, do they continue? So it's really difficult to get out that far. The majority of it will be in the stores this season. We may have some buys that we might pack away to use for next year, but the vast majority of it will be in stores this year. We're making the best decisions we can with the information that we've got. And we are being -- we're probably being more cautious than we are aggressive. There are certain categories that we think are going to be very good and we're aggressive on. So as an example, we continue to be very aggressive in the fitness category. We continue to be very aggressive in the bike category. We'll be very aggressive in the athletic footwear category, especially around running, as people coming out of this pandemic are really starting to realize that one of the great ways to be healthy is to be in shape and to be stronger. And we think we're in a great lane to help service that consumer who's looking to do that. So we're going to be very aggressive in some areas. \n And from a license standpoint around college football and some of the pro sports, depending on how things play out, we're not nearly as aggressive. So we're trying to make the right decisions based on the information we have. And like I said, some places we're being aggressive and other places we're pulling back. We don't see any change in what we're looking at from a store standpoint. We talked most recently about how we are trying to reduce space allocation, how we're trying to continue to focus on the team sport athlete. And although that team sport athlete, that baseball player, football player, soccer player may be constrained right now, that's not going to be in perpetuity, that they'll be back. And if it's not this fall or next spring, they will be back. So we think that's an important part of our business. As we continue to make changes to our footwear department and broaden the products that we carry in footwear or what we're doing in athletic apparel or in our women's business, I mean, right now, our largest -- our second and third largest brands in women's athletic apparel are CALIA and the new DSG brand. So we don't think that there's a big change. And one of the things with Curbside, we need to have the product that make -- if people want Curbside, they want to pick it up that day. And in order to have the inventory available to them, we need to have these stores. So it may not be very popular with people that don't truly understand our business, but we're very comfortable with the -- with our store configuration right now. Yes. So on the space allocation, we slowed that down right now based on the capital. We cut back on our CapEx budget pretty significantly. So that's been slowed down a little bit. As far as the outdoor categories, those outdoor categories have continued to be pretty good. We continue to comp positively in those areas. Immediately. I think we're concerned if we'll have enough of the right inventory. We'll then have to kind of go to some second choices and move some market share. But right now we feel pretty confident, we're in pretty good shape. There are some categories and some vendors we'd like to have some additional inventory from that we're moving market share to and we'll see how that goes. But right now, we feel pretty good. I don't think we see anything meaningfully different from a trading up or trading down. Some of our -- some categories the average unit retail is actually going up, such as footwear, but that's really got a fair amount to do with the mix that we have. And there's mix differences. As we said, we think the fitness business, the boat business, the bike business, anything that has to do with the outdoors is really -- continues to do extremely well, and we think that will continue going forward. Yes. I mean the lifestyle business continues to do extremely well. And so we continue to be enthusiastic about that. But we continue to be really enthusiastic about the running category because as people -- as it started to open up and people are getting out and even a little bit before that, when people could get out in social distance, they were out running, they were out walking, they were out walking and running. And that silhouette, we think, is going to continue to be very good for people trying to get out and get out in the fresh air and get in a little bit better shape of either walking or running. And we don't think that that's going to change anytime soon. We're in a great position to take advantage of that. I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and we'll look forward to seeing everybody on our next conference call. Thank you. Be safe."

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking our teammates for their hard work and dedication over the past several months. We've been incredibly impressed with how you've committed to serve our athletes and continued to serve communities. You've done a tremendous job responding to the constantly changing landscape. \n Through March 10, our consolidated same-store sales increased 7.9%, which was a clear indication that our strategies were working. Shortly thereafter, our strong sales trends abruptly changed as the spread of the virus accelerated, and on March 18, we closed our stores to the public.  \n For the quarter, our online sales increased 110%, including Curbside Contactless Pickup. This strength in eCommerce increased significantly after we closed our stores as online sales grew 210% since then through the end of the quarter. We continued to leverage our store network for ship-from-store and Curbside Pickup, while also fulfilling orders via our eCommerce fulfillment centers and distribution centers as well as directly from our vendors. Importantly, our vast fulfillment network seamlessly supported the significant increase in eCommerce volume, and our ability to leverage these many fulfillment methods helped us to continue to reduce shipping times to our athletes. \n We executed our new Curbside initiative within days as our stores, eCommerce and technology teams quickly helped us pivot our business and ensure that we were able to provide our athletes with a safe and convenient way to pick up their orders while reducing shipping and packaging expenses. This is a great reflection of our culture and our nimble operating model and a huge credit goes out to those teams. The athlete response has been overwhelmingly positive. Curbside sales were up 1,000% since its launch through the end of the quarter when you compare it to BOPIS sales in the prior year, and Curbside accounted for over 40% of our total eCommerce sales during this time period. We believe this experience will continue to be a big opportunity for us as we move forward. \n Now let me turn to the stores. By the end of the first quarter, we had reopened approximately 20% of our stores. And as of the end of May, approximately 80% of our stores have reopened. We expect to continue opening our remaining stores throughout the rest of Q2 and into Q3. As we reopen, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes is our highest priority, and we're following the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as federal, state and local authorities. As part of these efforts, we've enhanced our sanitizing protocols and are requiring face covering to be worn by all teammates. We're also requiring our teammates sanitize their hands regularly or wear gloves.  Next, we're communicating, supporting and enabling social distancing. This includes using floor details throughout the store and plexiglass screens at checkout as well as limiting the number of people in the store where applicable by local ordinance. And lastly, we're taking steps to minimize contact, including continuing to offer Curbside Pickup. These actions are being supported by teammate and athlete communication tools aimed at reinforcing healthy habits in addition to wellness protocols to ensure teammates are working only when healthy. \n As Ed mentioned, to date, we've been very pleased with the early results in our stores that have reopened, where we've seen a progressive recovery in sales and traffic. In fact, since reopening, many stores have comped positive on a brick-and-mortar basis. Furthermore, our online sales, including Curbside Pickup, have remained very strong, even in those markets where we've reopened our stores. We're regaining momentum and through the first 4 weeks of Q2, with 44% of our stores remaining closed on average, our consolidated same-store sales have decreased only 4%. As part of this, eCommerce sales have increased momentum and are over 250%. \n In closing, we believe our teammates and athletes will have new expectations related to their working and shopping experiences, and we're certain that the actions we're taking to build trust and to create confidence in these new experiences will pay off for the long term. Along with Ed, I remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods. \n I will now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail. Yes. No, the penetration of Curbside Pickup continues on. And Robby, I think the way to think about it is, we were down 4%, we had 44% of our stores on average closed during that period. And so if you do the math, you can say that we're very pleased with how the stores are performing when they reopen. And the second question about the level of promotions in the back half. Michael, I would -- it's Lauren. I would just add that I think in this omnichannel world, which we clearly lived in for the last 10 weeks, where the only way a consumer could place an order was online and the stores became a huge part of the fulfillment, they always were, but even a bigger part of our fulfillment and our demand driving, we really need to rethink what a sale is and what the profitability and flow-through is all the way through the P&L because the stores are such an integral part of what the eCommerce delivered over the last 10 weeks. It's very, very merged at this point. Yes. It's Lauren. Starting with the marketing, we definitely -- we were -- we cut back significantly when the COVID stores -- when the stores were closed, and we have re-upped it. And we're actually feeling very bullish on the back half of the year in terms of the spend and generating the consumer demand. So we are turning on the marketing, obviously, within reason and doing it in a phased approach. And then, Ed, you want to mention about the inventory? Yes. I think, Adrienne, you're absolutely right. The investments over the past few years, which really were meant to enable us to scale productively, all came to very positive fruition over the past several weeks. And the new consumer environment has definitely accelerated some of our pushes for innovation. We will be -- we're looking at the entire customer experience, the entire customer journey, how to provide more contactless experiences even in the store when people are shopping, whether that's our ShoeRunner app that we've tried right now where people can sort of self-help themselves, which is providing a ton of different opportunities there. Mobile will be a big piece for us going forward. So if anything, this has incredibly energized our innovation efforts and our technology teams behind the changing landscape. Yes. I just want to add on to that for a moment that comparing it to 2016, '17 and TSA feels a little different from how we're thinking about it now, which is, it's not about our brick-and-mortar competitors going under; it's about us gaining market share and gaining new customers and gathering customers to try our online business who had never tried it before. So it's just -- it's a different compare. I just wanted to point that out. It's not -- it's different, and it's actually very exciting. It continues to increase. It's been more than half for some time that touch the stores in some way, our eCommerce business. And obviously with the surge in Curbside, that increased. Tom, yes. So when we first closed the stores and right prior to that, we pretty much shut down all of those experiential elements in the store, be it the batting cages or the golf simulators. But we have now been working very hard over the last several weeks to figure out ways to continue those experiences in a safe manner. We've turned back on golf fittings. We are able to do it in a way that we believe is very safe for both our teammates and our athletes. And same with the baseball simulator. So we actually have adapted fairly well, and there seems to be consumer demand to keep those experiences going. Yes. Right now, the availability that we're presenting is availability that is available in store. I'm sorry, immediately. Yes, that is available to pick up immediately. So the patience has not been a factor. We actually think that's upside.  We can actually have, what we would call, a delayed buy-online-pickup-in-store experience. But we are -- that is something we're working on right now. And just as the patience for the entire order or the process, the whole thing has been taking on average less than 30 minutes and usually closer to 15 minutes to fulfill. So patience is important, but I think we're overdelivering."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Lee Belitsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 30.6% to approximately $1.33 billion. Consolidated same-store sales decreased 29.5%, driven by a 38.7% decrease in transactions and was partially offset by a 9.2% increase in average ticket. We saw declines in each of our 3 primary categories: hardlines, apparel and footwear.  \n As Lauren mentioned, prior to the impact of COVID-19, we were very pleased with our comp sales performance. And through March 10, our consolidated same-store sales increased 7.9%, a continuation of the strong comp trends we delivered in the second half of 2019. Shortly thereafter, we saw a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand due to the continued spread of the virus, and we closed all of our stores.  \n We were able to partially offset the negative sales impact from our store closures through a significant acceleration in our eCommerce business, including Curbside Contactless Pickup. For the quarter, our eCommerce sales grew 110% and as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 39% compared to 13% last year.  \n Gross profit in the first quarter was $219.3 million or 16.45% of net sales, a 1,290 basis point decline compared to the same period last year. Within gross profit, we saw a deleverage on fixed occupancy costs of 526 basis points due to the sales decline. It's important to note that while we have successfully negotiated payment term deferrals and rent abatements, this didn't materially affect the P&L in Q1 as deferrals don't change the total cash payments, and abatements are spread over the remaining life of the lease. We also saw lower merchandise margins, which decreased by 475 basis points and were primarily driven by sales mix; higher promotions, particularly early in the quarter; and a $28 million write-down of inventory resulting from our temporary store closures. \n Finally, we saw higher shipping expenses and eCommerce fulfillment costs as a result of our meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth as well as the fixed costs associated with our 2 new dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers that \topened in the third quarter last year. \n SG&A expenses were $403.2 million or 30.24% of net sales, up 494 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results. Again, that was due to the sales decline. However, SG&A dollars decreased $83 million compared to last year. This includes approximately $90 million reduction in expenses following our temporary store closures and was partially offset by $31 million of incremental teammate compensation and safety costs. Within the $90 million reduction in expenses, included $21 million of income associated with changes in the company's deferred comp plan for investment values for which the corresponding investment loss was recognized in other expense. \n In total, we recorded a loss per diluted share of $1.71 compared to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 last year. \n Since the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases in mid-March, we acted quickly and decisively to preserve cash and fortify our balance sheet. Collectively, these actions have bolstered our cash and cash equivalents to approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, and we had $214 million of additional borrowing capacity on our line of credit. \n Let's walk through the details. First, we meaningfully reduced cash expenses across the business, including marketing, travel, contractors and within payroll through salary reductions and furloughs of a significant number of our teammates across our stores, distribution centers and customer support center. Concurrent with the reopening of the majority of our stores, last week, we restored previously reduced salaries for our teammates, except for certain executives, and have started bringing teammates back from furlough. We have also had very productive discussions with our vendors to reduce inventory receipts and extend payment terms. Likewise, we've had similarly productive discussions with our landlords about deferring and abating rent payments.  \n Additionally, we completed the issuance of $575 million of 3.25% convertible senior notes due in 2025, which includes a full exercise of the $75 million overallotment option. These notes provide for an initial conversion option once our stock price reaches $35.38 per share, and thus dilution would typically occur when our stock price exceeds this threshold. However, in conjunction with the notes issuance, we entered into stock hedge transactions to reduce the dilution from shares issuable upon conversion of the notes. The hedge transactions will provide economic dilution protection upon maturity of the notes if our stock is trading at or between $35.38 and $52.42, the aggregate net proceeds from the issuance and the sale of notes were approximately $558 million or approximately $502 million net of the note hedge. \n Due to current accounting rules, we have discounted the value of the notes on the balance sheet to $398 million as of the end of the first quarter. This discount will be amortized as noncash interest expense resulting in a total annualized interest rate of 11.6% on the discounted value of the notes. We also exercised the accordion feature on our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity from $1.6 billion to $1.855 billion and ended the first quarter with approximately $1.4 billion outstanding. \n Finally, we made meaningful modifications to our 2020 capital allocation plan. This includes significant reductions to our planned capital expenditures. We also temporarily suspended our quarterly dividend as well as our share repurchase program. As our business continues to stabilize, we may resume opportunistic share repurchases under our current authorizations. \n For the first quarter, net capital expenditures were $51 million, and we paid $28 million in quarterly dividends, which was declared prior to the suspension. We did not repurchase any shares. Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 2% compared to the end of the same period last year. And working alongside our brands, we acted decisively to reduce, defer and cancel planned receipts to align with our new sales forecast. For the rest of 2020, we are conservatively planning our inventory receipts. However, we have plenty of liquidity as well as strong relationships with our vendors if we need to opportunistically chase products.\n With respect to our outlook, there's a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the scale and duration of several key external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders and economic stimulus, as well as employment and consumer confidence and their potential impact on our business. Given this uncertainty, we do not believe it is appropriate to provide a 2020 outlook for sales and earnings at this time. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, we move forward with confidence, we have ample liquidity and are pleased with our market position as well as our Q2 sales trends. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And operator, you may now open the line for questions. Well, if they're closed, we're not recording any brick-and-mortar sales in it, but we are continuing to do Curbside Pickup. Curbside Pickup, we're including within our eCommerce sales. Thank you. So Michael, it's Lee. I think with respect to the margin structure, and I gather you're talking about operating margins, if we continue these trends where we're getting the brick-and-mortar sales back up and running and they're getting back up and running well, the profitability of that channel is strong. And our eCommerce business has continued to grow. It hasn't been terribly promotional, frankly, on the eCommerce channel. And we've increased the Curbside Contactless Pickup, which eliminates the shipping and packaging expense. And if we're able to maintain a high penetration of that, the profitability of our eCommerce business should improve as well. So it all depends how it's going to mix out. I think in aggregate it's a good picture for profitability going forward, for total profits. What it does to the profit margin line, it's really going to depend on how it mixes out between eCom and brick-and-mortar stores. But if we can keep those brick-and-mortar stores rolling along at -- with respectable comps, our profit picture should be pretty solid going forward. So with regard to eCommerce, so we do have some drag on the gross margin due to the additional shipping costs. But I don't expect the eCom penetration to remain at 39% of the business as it was in Q1. If we get our brick-and-mortar sales back and eCom stays at 39%, then we'll all be happy. But I don't expect that it's going to stay that high. And I think that even though we had significant savings from Curbside Pickup, it couldn't impact -- it couldn't offset the full impact of going to 39% penetration on -- from a gross margin perspective. \n With regard to lease -- occupancy expense, I think there will be opportunities -- continue to be opportunities to drive down our occupancy expenses, to reduce our rent expense. We do have north of 100 leases coming up for renewal each year, and we're aggressively renegotiating those leases as we go forward. And we expect to continue to have opportunities there. Yes, without the stores, we don't have the Curbside Pickup. So that's becoming a growing consideration in how much real estate we need. I think shortly after we closed the stores, we were in a scenario where nobody knew what was going to happen, how long the stores were going to be closed, if it was going to be weeks, months, nobody knew. So we were pretty aggressive with promotions online in those first couple of weeks after we closed. And we were also still clearing out a little bit of the winter merchandise early in the quarter because we didn't have much cold weather, so we were clearing through some of that remaining winter merchandise in stores even before we closed. The sales have been strong in the stores as we've opened them. So we're bringing back the lion's share of the furloughed associates in the stores as they open. We are taking them on a store-by-store basis because they're not all performing equally. But we do have -- we had in Q1 and into Q2 some extra expenses in the store. We have continued with our Hero Pay program where we are increasing -- temporarily increasing the hourly pay in stores and distribution centers by 15%. That's going to continue for a little while. We haven't determined yet when we're going -- that's going to end. We are -- we do have extra payroll going into cleaning, sanitizing stores, wiping things down, wiping off the shopping carts and so on. So there's actually some extra payroll in the stores right now as we get through COVID. So I would expect that as the stores open, we would incur additional payroll expense for a while in the stores versus what we have in the past. And we experienced that at the end of Q1 as we started to open the stores, and we will experience that well into Q2. \n With regard to admin expenses, we have open positions right now. We'll be cautious as to hiring back to those open positions until we really see what's happening with the business. And we noted that we've restored -- as of the fourth week of May, we restored the pay reductions to almost all the associates, except for a few of the senior executives in the company. As we got to the point where we had 70%, 80% of the stores opened, we restored their pay. So we still have some meaningful savings coming in travel and contractors and -- but we do have extra expenses we're incurring as well. One thing is we also improved our delivery performance during the quarter versus last year. So notwithstanding the big increase in sales that we had, we took about half day off of our average delivery time from the same period last year. So we continue to make improvements there. Yes. It's hard to say how it's going to play out. It could get stronger, but it could be some that was pulled forward as well because the kids are out of school and people are working from home. So they may have got into some of the summer purchases early. So it's a little hard to say on those summer trends how it's going to play out. Well, Will, as you said, we're not guiding to that. But we're really pleased with the momentum we've got and hope we can keep it up. So again, a meaningful kind of majority of the sales are -- come out of our stores, whether it be Curbside or ship-from-store. Mix, fortunately, is a little bit more skewed towards some of the bigger, bulkier items that are more expensive to ship, and that's kind of favorable from an earnings perspective to do that from the stores. The eCommerce business has been building. And as we have opened stores, obviously, our store sales have been building. Some of that is timed in connection with when the stimulus checks arrived. But the stimulus checks arrived going out a month ago and the business continues to be good now. But stimulus checks probably helped. It's hard to measure it. But we're still encouraged with where the business is now. Well the eCommerce, we talked about the eCommerce business in May being up north of 250%. It was 210% in the back half of Q1. I mean there are parts of that, that come off because we're not paying people that aren't working anymore. And we had 3 weeks of paying people that weren't working. So that piece comes off, at least in the stores, and we're returning people from furlough. But as I said earlier, we are going to have increased expenses associated with running the stores because we largely had to bring back pretty much most, if not all, of our store associates because the sales trends have been pretty solid there. And we have extra expenses for the hourly workers of 15% and extra hours we've got in the stores to do regular cleaning as well. So we will continue to have some savings from people that are -- folks that are still furloughed at this point. We'll have some savings from lower expenses in May. And we're not aggressively hiring back open positions right now. So we'll have some savings associated with that, but we're going to have some extra costs, too. Yes. We're in the process of paying down that revolver debt as we go through. I think the worst of our concerns and many concerns around the liquidity crisis that could have possibly occurred from mid-March through mid-April seemed to be behind us. Our business is coming back. Our relationships with our banks are really good. So we're in the process of bringing that down."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the DICK'S Sporting Goods Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Charlie, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] \n I will now hand you over to your host, Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations, to begin. Nate, please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Executive Chairman; Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months. \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. \n And finally, a few admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Beginning in Q1 2022, we will update our method for determining consolidated same-store sales. Prior to fiscal 2022, relocated store locations have been excluded for our consolidated same-store sales calculation until the relocated store commenced its 14th full month of operations. Beginning in fiscal 2022, relocated store locations will remain in our calculations, consistent with our holistic view of each market. \n In an 8-K filed today, we have provided a table that presents quarterly and full year consolidated same-store sales results for fiscal 2021 calculated in the same manner that same-store sales will be calculated beginning in fiscal 2022. The table will also be available on our Investor Relations website. \n Second, also beginning in Q1, we will adopt new rules that will impact the accounting of our convertible senior notes due 2025, resulting in lower interest expense and higher diluted shares on a GAAP basis. We do not expect the net effect of these changes to materially impact our GAAP earnings per diluted share. Given our intent to settle the principal in cash and the shares that will be delivered by our bond hedge at settlement, we do not expect the notes to have a dilutive effect at settlement. Accordingly, we believe that reflecting the notes as debt more closely reflects the underlying economics of the transaction which is included in our non-GAAP outlook. For additional details on this, you can refer to our press release that we issued this morning. \n Next, I want to highlight a new investor presentation that was posted to our Investor Relations website earlier today. The intent of this presentation is to serve as a resource to provide current and prospective investors an overview of our company, strategy and competitive differentiation. \n And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our first quarter 2022 earnings results before the market opens on May 25, 2022, with our subsequent earnings call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We had an exceptionally strong 2021 and delivered record sales and earnings. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 26.5%, which was on top of a 9.9% increase from the prior year and 3.7% increase in 2019. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $15.70 represented a 157% increase over last year and a 325% increase over 2019. \n Our current success is the result of a deliberate multiyear transformational journey that is driving sustainable sales and profitability growth. With an athlete-first approach, we have built significant competitive advantages across our merchandise assortment, brand relationships, service model, in-store and digital commerce experiences. We have also invested in our technology capabilities, including data science, personalization, to advance our omnichannel growth strategy. Virtually nothing about our business is the same as it was 5 years ago. \n As expected, 2021 has been the most transformational year in our company's history. Among our accomplishments, we drove strong growth in our core DICK'S business; launched DICK'S House of Sport, a completely new experiential destination that's redefining sports retail; we reengineered Golf Galaxy and launched the Golf Galaxy Performance Center, a new immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels; and finally, we unveiled Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept, to better serve the outdoor athlete. \n We are the clear market leader in a fragmented $120 billion industry with strong secular growth trends. Our strategies are working, and we've set our business on a new trajectory for growth. We'll continue to take market share and extend our lead. We have the best overall management team we've ever had and are entering 2022 stronger than ever. Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the future of our business. \n Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Ed's thanks to our team for their incredible passion, hard work and dedication to our athletes and to our business. At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great, and none of what has been accomplished this past year would have been possible without our exceptional team. \n Now on to our results. In Q4, we delivered the largest sales quarter in our company's history. Our record quarterly sales of $3.35 billion were driven by a consolidated same-store sales increase of nearly 6%, which was on top of a 19.3% increase in the same period last year and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 comps were supported by growth in key categories and increases in both average ticket and transactions as our diverse category and brand portfolio, world-class omnichannel platform and strong execution helped us continue to meet robust consumer demand. \n Our athlete counts remain strong, and we added another 2.3 million new athletes during the quarter for a total of approximately 8 million new athletes acquired this year. Our highly differentiated product assortment, combined with our granular and disciplined promotion management, is enabling us to drive significantly higher merch margin rates. During the quarter, there were no major store or site-wide promotions, and we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 476 basis points versus 2020 and by 848 basis points versus 2019. Led by strong sales and merchandise margin, we achieved non-GAAP EBT margin of nearly 14%. In total, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64 represented a 50% increase over the same period last year and a 176% increase over Q4 of 2019. \n As Ed indicated, over the past 5 years, we've been on a transformational journey that's driving sustainable growth in sales and profitability. During this time, we meaningfully improved our merchandise assortment, including developing even stronger relationships with our key brand partners to drive greater access to highly differentiated product. \n We implemented an enhanced service model and leaned into highly engaging in-store experiences. We focused on our culture and put our teammates, athletes and communities at the center of everything we do. Finally, we invested in technology, data science and our omnichannel platform and significantly improved our digital marketing and personalization capabilities. These transformational changes were driving improved results well before the pandemic and further accelerated our performance over the past 2 years. \n DICK'S is a growth company. And with the recent completion of our $1.5 billion long-term investment-grade debt issuance, we have ample flexibility to pursue our robust growth agenda. We're entering 2022 with incredible momentum and confidence in our business. Virtually our entire category portfolio has re-baselined meaningfully higher versus pre-COVID sales levels. We've gained considerable market share in key categories. And as the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, we are well positioned to extend our lead and continue gaining share in a large, growing and fragmented industry. \n Importantly, our 2022 sales and earnings guidance establishes a new foundation upon which we will build in the years ahead. Navdeep will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks. Our focus in 2022 is on enhancing our existing strategies to continue to accelerate our core business and enable long-term profitable growth. First, our stores will continue to be the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. \n During 2021, our stores comped up 42%, including a 14% increase in Q4. They enabled over 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online line sales through either ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. In 2022, we will continue to enhance our service model and provide opportunities to try products through experiential elements, such as our premium full-service footwear decks, our HitTrax batting cages, soccer shops and golf simulators. We will also continue to invest in technology to enhance our store fulfillment and in-store pickup capabilities and drive profitability of our e-commerce business. \n Beyond our stores, we will also continue to improve our digital experience by adding more personalization and making it even easier for athletes to find the best product for them. Backed by our investments in service, data science and our ScoreCard Program, we will continue to serve our athletes whenever, wherever and however they want, instilling confidence in their purchase and inspiring their loyalty. \n Next within merchandising. Our relationships with key brands are stronger than ever, and we will build on our momentum and drive growth in important categories, including athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf. We are rooted in sport, and our ability to showcase an entire brand portfolio across our national store footprint and online is highly valued by our strategic partners. \n In 2021, we announced a groundbreaking new partnership with Nike to create an unmatched experience for our connected athletes. We've been encouraged by the athlete response and look forward to continually working with Nike to anticipate and fulfill the evolving needs of the athletes we serve. Looking ahead, we will continue to make big bets with all of our big brand partners to deliver an unparalleled athlete experience across our physical and digital properties. \n At the same time, we will leverage athlete feedback and insights to drive vertical brand growth in new segments and categories. As we've discussed on previous calls, our vertical brands have become a significant source of strength and growth. During 2021, our vertical brands eclipsed $1.7 billion in sales, and together, represented our largest brand in golf, team sports, fitness and outdoor equipment. \n Finally, we remain very pleased by the early results of our new concepts and experiences, including DICK'S House of Sport, Golf Galaxy Performance Center and Public Lands. We're excited to continue to refine and grow these concepts while pulling key learnings into our core business. \n In closing, I want to reiterate that our record performance in 2021 was the result of our deliberate investments, our emphasis on analyzing, understanding and meeting the evolving needs of our athletes and the tremendous execution from our team. We are very confident about the ongoing long-term growth potential of our business and believe that no one is better positioned to lead in the marketplace. \n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2021 results. Consolidated sales increased 28.3% to $12.29 billion. As Ed noted, consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 26.5%. This was on top of a 9.9% increase last year and a 3.7% increase in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, our online business has grown from 16% in 2019 to 21% in the current year. \n Gross profit for full year was $4.71 billion or 38.33% of net sales and improved 650 basis points from last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 407 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 223 basis points. We also saw lower shipping expense as a percentage of sales. This was due to sustained strength in our brick-and-mortar sales and higher brick-and-mortar sales penetration, following last year's temporary store closures. These items were partially offset by higher freight costs, resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability. \n SG&A expenses were $2.66 billion or 21.67% of net sales and leveraged 231 basis points from last year, primarily due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $366 million, primarily due to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales, as well as last year's operating expense reduction following our temporary store closures. In the prior year, SG&A included $152 million of COVID-related compensation and safety cost. However, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation program with a longer-term focus, including increasing and accelerating annual merit and higher hourly wages, partially reinvesting last year's COVID-related costs. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $2.03 billion or 16.47% of net sales and increased $1.29 billion or 882 basis points from the same period last year. In total, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $15.70. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.12 last year, a 157% year-over-year increase and a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.69 in 2019, a 325% increase. \n Now moving to our Q4 results. We are pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.3% to $3.35 billion. As Lauren said, this was the largest sales quarter in our history. Consolidated same-store sales increased 5.9% on top of a 19.3% increase in the same period last year and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019. Our strong comps were driven by growth in team sports, apparel and footwear, as well as a 4.8% increase in average ticket and a 1.1% increase in transactions. When compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 28.5%, driven by balanced growth across our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear. \n Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 14% versus 2020 and delivered a 24% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage. As expected, our e-commerce sales decreased 11% versus last year, which was on top of a 57% increase in Q4 of 2020. This reflects our deliberate decision to minimize site-wide promotion to better manage our inventory throughout the quarter. Compared to 2019, e-commerce sales increased 39%. And as a percentage of net sales, our online business has grown from 25% in 2019 to 27% in current quarter. E-commerce penetration was 32% last year. \n Now moving to gross profit. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.26 billion or 37.58% of net sales and improved 391 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 476 basis points, primarily due to fewer promotions, the result of our increasingly differentiated assortment and disciplined promotional strategies. In addition, certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained, which resulted in a reduced promotional environment. We also saw a favorable sales mix. As expected, these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability. \n Compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved 898 basis points. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 848 basis points due to fewer promotions and favorable sales mix, as well as leverage on fixed occupancy costs, partially offset by higher freight costs. \n SG&A expenses were $783.6 million or 23.38% of net sales and leveraged 97 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to increase in sales. SG&A dollars increased $22 million, primarily due to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales. In the prior year quarter, SG&A included $47 million of COVID-related compensation and safety costs, as well as $30 million donation we made to DICK'S Foundation to help jump start youth sports program struggling to make comeback in the pandemic, most of which was in Q4. As I mentioned previously, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation programs with a longer-term focus, partially reinvesting last year's COVID-related cost. \n Compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales deleveraged 45 basis points, primarily due to the increase in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales, as well as hourly wage rate investments and higher advertising to support our new concepts. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $468.4 million or 13.97% of net sales and increased approximately $170 million or 442 basis points from the same period last year. Compared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $319.8 million or 827 basis points as a percentage of net sales. \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 last year, a 50% increase on a year-over-year basis and a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32 in 2019, a 176% increase. \n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.16. This included $8.1 million in noncash interest expense, as well as 12.6 million additional diluted shares that are designed to be offset by our bond hedge at settlement but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to our convertible notes we issued in Q1 2020. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. In January, we were very pleased to complete our inaugural long-term investment-grade debt transaction, raising $1.5 billion of cash through the issuance of our senior unsecured notes. As a result, we have further strengthened our financial position, providing us the flexibility to continue investing in our business, as well as repay the $575 million of convertible senior notes. \n We ended Q4 with approximately $2.64 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our new $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter ended inventory levels increased 17.6% compared to Q4 of last year. Looking ahead, we continue to aggressively chase product to meet demand and prioritize inventory availability over cost. As part of this, we expect elevated freight expenses to continue and have included the impact of this within our 2022 outlook. \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $64.7 million, and we paid $35.7 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares of our stock for $750 million at an average price of $110.72. We have approximately $1.85 billion remaining under our new $2 billion share repurchase program. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through the share repurchases and dividends. \n Now let me move to our fiscal 2022 outlook for sales and earnings. Coming off 2 consecutive record years in 2020 and 2021, our 2022 expectations provide a new foundation upon which we will build in the years ahead. As Ed said, our strategies are working, and they have set us on a new trajectory. Let us now review the details of 2022 sales and earnings and capital allocation in detail. \n Consolidated same-store sales are expected to be in the range of negative 4% to flat with quarterly comps expected to improve sequentially throughout the year. This is on top of a 26.5% comp sales increase in 2021 and a 9.9% increase in 2020 on as-reported basis. EBT is expected to be in the range of $1.43 billion and $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $55 million of pretax interest expense associated with our new $1.5 billion long-term debt. At the midpoint, EBT margin is expected to be approximately 12.5%.\n Within this, gross margin is expected to decline approximately 250 basis points at the midpoint. This assumes some normalization of promotional landscape, higher freight expenses and modest deleverage on fixed expenses. SG&A expense is expected to deleverage, primarily due to hourly wage rate investments, as well as investments in advertising, talent and technology to fund our growth strategies. In total, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $13.10. \n Our earnings guidance is based on 94 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditures of $340 million to $365 million, which will be concentrated in improvements in our existing stores, ongoing investments in technology as well as new store growth. \n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends of 11% to $0.4875 per share or $1.95 on an annualized basis. In addition, our plan includes a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider using our expected strong free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $200 million.\n Before concluding, I'd like to take a moment to highlight an upcoming change in our disclosures. Beginning in Q1 2022, we will be moving away from providing e-commerce sales growth and penetration metrics. Our athletes are increasingly shopping across multiple channels on the same transaction, and it no longer makes sense to try and attribute a sale to a specific channel. And with EBT margins being similar, regardless of an online versus in-person transaction, the difference is even less relevant from a modeling perspective. \n We believe the single view of the consumer and of our business best represents our omnichannel approach, which centers around serving our athletes whenever, wherever and however they want to shop. As you know, we previously announced our intent to make the shift in 2020 but delayed as a result of COVID-19 and related temporary store closures. We will continue to provide consolidated same-store sales results with an updated method, as Nate described in his introduction. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 results. We are now looking forward to continuing this success in 2022 and over the longer term. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the new margin base for the company. You've talked about it being a foundation. One of the assumptions, it sounds like in '22, is some normalization of promotions or markdowns. I guess what if it's more than some? What are the puts and the takes in gross margin? Are you expecting supply chain eventually to go away, and that's why we should feel confident in this new normal for gross margin? \nLauren Hobart: I'll take that, Simeon. Thank you for the question. From a margin standpoint, we do believe that the vast majority of our merch margin improvements over time are sustainable. We do expect some normalization of promotions, but what's really driving that is a complete change in our merchandising assortment, such that we now have products that are highly differentiated and not really subject to a vast promotional environment. \n And so what if it's more than some? I mean, we will be managing our pricing and our promotions as we do, looking every day at what the right prices to our customers and for our business, and we expect to be able to drive significant continued margin gains versus where we were prepandemic. \nSimeon Gutman: And then maybe just a direct follow-up. Is there something around the initial markup? Is there something around how you're using the circular where you can basically feel confident that you're at this permanently higher level? Like what is the bottom-up reason why we should be confident that we've reached this new normal? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Simeon, I think it's a few key things. First of all, as I mentioned, it is the differentiated product assortment that is not a subject because some of the products are more high-heat and desirable products. They're not a subject to a promotional environment. But at the same time, we also have evolved our marketing mix from what used to be a fully print-based plan where we would have to make decisions on pricing and promotion many weeks before understanding what the market was going to be like, to a much more digital and flexible environment now.\n And we also have stepped away from the business of being promotional on a total site-wide or store-wide level because we can now be much more personalized and granular in terms of our offers with direct customer messaging. So we absolutely feel there are structural things in our gross margin that are going to set us up to permanently retain this higher level. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. I'll turn it over. Congratulations. Good luck. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congrats on another commendable finish to the year to the team. Lauren, my first question is for you. It's on the Nike partnership. What was Nike total as a percent of, I guess, COGS or however you want to do it for 2021? And then can you give us more detail on the partnership kind of as a key distributor in their \"marketplace of the future\"? Or is there any additional advertising demand creation budget? Will the stores look any different? Any details on that rollout, especially in light of what we've heard from other partners. \n And then Navdeep, for you, 2 quick ones. What does your 2022 outlook anticipate in terms of, number one, the impact on the supply chain of higher oil prices; and number two, the impact on your target market in terms of demand forecasting? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. So starting off with the Nike partnership. Our relationship with Nike is at an all-time high, and I would say it's become incredibly strategic in that we are reinventing together what the customer experience is. We started that over the past several years and most recently with our connected membership program, where consumers can opt in to both a DICK'S and Nike membership, and that unlocks tremendous amount of access to products for them, experiences and content.\n And so I do believe we will continue to innovate with Nike, spend in co-marketing as we have and really reinvent the consumer experience. I would say that that's true of all of our strategic partners. We have many strategic partners, if you look at our co-creation model with Adidas and Under Armour and tremendous strategic partnerships with Callaway and TaylorMade. \n To answer your specific question about Nike and what percentage of sales they were for this past year, they were 17% of our mix. Navdeep? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Adrienne, thanks for your question. I think maybe I'll answer both questions together. When we created our budget, the geopolitical situations were not what they are right now, so we'll continue to watch how these situations evolve. In terms of the demand, I'll start with that, and then I'll come to the oil prices. We feel strongly about the demand. We have seen a sustained level of demand, both even in Q4 and all through 2021.\n When we look at the macro changes, we are seeing that those are still very lasting. The lifestyle changes that our athletes have made in terms of focus on the health and fitness, the greater participation in the outdoor activities, as well as casualization of the workplace, that trend has continued to remain elevated. \n And what I -- what Lauren called out, right, the brand partnerships that we have, the allocations that we are getting, as well as the capabilities that we have built internally to be able to kind of capture the demand gives us a lot of confidence. \n And then on the -- in terms of the oil prices, we looked at the -- when we created the budget, as you can imagine, that was at the beginning of this year, we used the market prices as part of our budget expectation, and we'll closely monitor the situation as the year evolves in terms of our financial expectations. But we are very optimistic in the guidance that we have given based on the time and place when the budgets were created. \nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Can you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about comp performance in the first half versus second half? I think you mentioned sequential improvement each quarter. Anything you can provide in terms of color around what -- how you guys are planning and specifically in the March, April period as you anniversary stimulus? \n And then just second, just curious about category performance in '21 versus '19. Which categories sit most above your 2019 levels? And how are you thinking about growth by category in 2022? \nLauren Hobart: You take the first, Navdeep, and I'll take the second. \nNavdeep Gupta: Paul, this is Navdeep. I'll take the first question. Like I called out in our guidance, we are expecting the comps to sequentially improve. I think to one of the factors you called out, which is the stimulus impact, the stimulus impact, I would say, was much more in March through the May time frame. And so as we kind of lap that in Q1, that expectation has been included in our guidance. As well as, as we look to the inventory position, we believe that will continue to improve. We finished strongly at the end of Q4 of 2021. However, we are continuing to build our inventory as we go into the peak selling season here. So we believe that the inventory position, as well as the lapping of the stimulus money from last year, is what we have called out that we expect our comps to sequentially improve as we move through the year. \nLauren Hobart: And regarding our category performance in 2021 versus 2019, I think it's really important to note that we have increased our sales in every single category over -- meaningfully over 2019 with the exception of hunt, which is a result of a long-term strategy. But every single category has re-baselined significantly higher. We saw, in 2021, incredible strength in our -- what I would say is our core businesses, so team sports, athletic apparel, athletic footwear and golf. I'll even point out golf in this past year had a record number of rounds played. So we have a lot of confidence in those categories. And then in some of the \"pandemic-surging categories\" like fitness and bikes, while there's some rightsizing going on, they are significantly higher than they were in 2019. \nOperator: The next question comes from Warren Cheng of Evercore. \nWarren Cheng: I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Simeon's question, and I just want to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. It sounds like you expect some normalization in promotions this year. But then on the flip side, there's going to be elevated freight expense in your gross margin structure that's potentially going to normalize the other direction. So on a net basis, am I hearing correctly that this -- the guidance you've given is down 250, that's a rough proxy for kind of the new sustainable gross margin structure going forward? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, this is Navdeep. I'll take this question. So in terms of the freight expenses, what we have called out is that we expect the freight expenses to remain elevated, even in 2022. So there's not much of a decline that we are expecting in freight expenses. At least as of now, we can't see that playing out in the marketplace. \n The reduction in the gross margin that we have called out is primarily related to the normalization of the promotions environment and some deleverage as well on the fixed expenses with the midpoint of the comp guidance that we have given. \nLauren Hobart: But Warren, I do want to also mention, Navdeep mentioned in his opening remarks, that we do think, across the board, this is a new base from which we can grow in the future, our sales and our margin rates. \nWarren Cheng: Okay. Great. Okay. That was kind of what I was getting at. And then my second -- my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask about some of your brand partnerships. If you kind of look outside your biggest 2 or 3, can you just give us a little sense of how some of those conversations are going? Are there smaller brands that you highlight as getting more material or maybe conversations you're having now that you haven't had before in the past? \nLauren Hobart: Our brand relationships are at an all-time high. We are having incredibly strategic discussions with every key brand partner we have in key categories, and that's across athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports. We are also working with new and emerging brands, as we always have, and continue to take bets on emerging players. \n But over -- across the board, I would say some -- part of the reason for this elevated expectation that we have is our relationships with our brand partners are at an all-time high. We're getting better allocation, and they are narrowing distribution, and we are working with them to reinvent the consumer experience. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Our question also centered around the comp build for 2022. We wondered if you could talk to us a little bit about the big ticket assumptions in the outlook versus what you've seen in '21, how inflation comes into play with your comp guide and any kind of market share assumptions there. \n And then our second question is you've mentioned you have a much different assortment than you did 5 years ago. How much do you think the success of the DICK'S Sporting Goods private label brand has been to changing over your assortment and your market share gains. \nNavdeep Gupta: Kate, this is Navdeep. I'll take the first one in terms of the build for FY '22. So maybe I'll begin a little bit with what we saw in Q4. So the vast majority of our Q4 comp was driven by ticket. But actually, if you'll peel that a little bit further, what you see is that there was a strong growth that we saw in transactions in our store, and the ticket increase was actually driven by our decision to be not promotional in the e-comm and in our stores. \n So as we look to 2022, we will constantly continue to evaluate what is the right strategy of balancing our -- kind of the needs of the athlete as well as what is the right decision from a marketplace perspective. And in terms of -- we haven't given this level of granularity, but I would say that we expect that the tickets will continue to be stronger as we look to '22. However, transactions will also remain strong as we have seen a good experience and the traction with our brick-and-mortar business as well as e-comm. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. From an assortment standpoint, our vertical brands remain very, very strong. We're over $1.7 billion. We're getting very strong growth out of our vertical brands, and we continue to use those brands to fill in opportunities across our portfolio. Brands like DSG, which brings in an opening price point; and CALIA, which attracts the female -- athletic female; and then VRST, our new men's apparel brand, all fill white space that was missing in our portfolio before. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I want to ask you about the new debt you took and what that means for some -- for growth initiatives going forward. Does it signal more aggressive growth, higher CapEx? I know you gave guidance for next year, which is up a little bit. But longer term, store count growth, et cetera, if you could sort of talk to that. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Michael. So the new debt we just raised, we're very pleased. We raised $1.5 billion investment-grade debt, which just gives us an incredible amount of opportunity to invest in our business and growth. So first and foremost, we are going to maintain what we would consider an appropriate cash balance and always make sure that we can weather any storm. We're also going to invest heavily in our business, be that new store expansion, real estate and in-store experience, as well as technology. And then lastly, of course, we will look to return excess cash flow to shareholders in various ways.\n So in terms of our store count growth and our CapEx, store counts, we are expecting 11 new DICK'S stores this coming year -- actually 11 new stores, period, 4 DICK'S and 7 specialty and 11 remodel stores, including 1 House of Sport and 1 Golf Galaxy Performance Center. And our CapEx will support all the activities I mentioned before in in-store and real estate and technology. \nMichael Baker: Okay. That's helpful. One more, if I could. I don't know if you're willing to talk about the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter. You came in better than the pre-announcement on -- in early January, so I suppose that implies that January was better than expectation. But what, in particular, was better in January? And can you talk about how January was planned versus November and December? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We were very, very pleased with our January performance, as you note, as we did indicate what our forecast was in the early weeks of January. What happened to drive those results even higher is that we had an improved inventory level versus our expectations, just given our really strong promotional management throughout the earlier months in the quarter. And then we also had a significant impact of cold weather that drove a lot of outerwear business in January. So we were very pleased. Overall, we were pleased with January versus our forecast and also versus 2 years ago. It performed very, very well. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Congrats on a really great year. My question is on the long term and how you're thinking about the algo beyond '22 as you build off the roughly $14 million per store that you're generating today and the 12.5% EBT margin that you've forecasted for '22. \nNavdeep Gupta: Chuck, this is Navdeep. I'll take that question. First of all, we are very excited about the results that we have delivered over the last couple of years but actually, as Ed called out, the transformation journey we have been on for the last 5 years. And what gives us the confidence as we look to the future are the things that, like Lauren called out, the changes and the improvements that we have made are so foundational to our success over the last few years, and that's what gives us the confidence as we look to the future as well. \n In terms of an EBT margin, we have improved our sales over. If you just look at pre-pandemic, our sales are up $3 billion. Our earnings, even with the midpoint of guidance, will be up over $1 billion from where they were. So we are really excited about the results, and we feel like we can continue to create this in '22 as a new foundation and continue to grow our sales and profitability on a long-term basis. \nCharles Grom: Okay, very helpful. And then when you think about House of Sport and Public Lands, you talked about key learnings that you plan to introduce into the core business. Just wondering if you can maybe provide some examples of some of the recent learnings over the past couple of quarters and then what you are applying to the existing store fleet. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. House of Sport is a fully experiential destination with a tremendous service model, community involvement, different fitting room experience and all those things we are pulling back into the DICK'S -- all of the DICK'S stores when we look at how we want to serve athletes and different experiences that we want to build into. You'll see us continuing to grow things of an experiential nature in our stores, so increased soccer shops, increased premium footwear decks. We've already -- we've got HitTrax in many of our stores. But most importantly, I think the service model has become really emblematic of how we want to serve athletes. \n With Public Lands, we have really -- we're excited about the learnings that we're getting about the outdoor category and the consumer that we feel is underserved there. We've got brand partnerships that we're very excited about developing, which can come back to DICK'S and just a general focus on the outdoor business in DICK'S Sporting Goods. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is have you tried to put a number on how much you thought that inventory constraints impacted fourth quarter comps in total? And maybe thoughts on how that could impact perhaps the first quarter of '22. And then I have a follow-up. \nLauren Hobart: So we haven't put a number on how much inventory constraints impacted Q4. But I will say, for the last 2 years, there have been inventory challenges, supply chain challenges, constraints. And what I think we've proven with the 5.9% comp that we just delivered in Q4 is that despite some inventory constraints, we have a broad portfolio, we can offer some substitutions when we don't have the exact products that people wanted and that we can manage really well. And we will expect to do that through any choppiness that's coming through the next year. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then on the capital allocation question, you mentioned maintaining a higher level of cash on the balance sheet. But at this point, you're sitting on gross cash that's more than 20% of your current market cap, and you'll probably generate another 10% in free cash flow this year. So I guess, to what extent is the $200 million share repurchase guide conservative versus maybe looking to opportunistically collapse that convert structure? And if you were able to take the convert structure down, how accretive might that be to EPS? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Chris, great question. I don't think so we will dispute anything that you called out. But like we called out in my prepared remarks, the $200 million is a minimum that we called out. So as we look to this year, we will evaluate all available options to us, whether to do an incremental opportunistic share buyback as well as we'll definitely look into a convert, as we have called out. And you know that these notes are callable next year and -- but still, the maturity is still further quite a ways away. So we'll continue to evaluate all opportunities available to us, and at the same time, continue to maintain an appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet because the uncertainties in the world are not behind us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Beth Reed of Truist Securities. \nBeth Reed Pricoli: Could you frame for us how you're thinking about gross margins, maybe first half versus second half, given that it sounds like you don't expect freight to ease all that much, even in the back half, if I understood that comment correctly? \n And then thus far, have you seen anything in the environment to indicate that perhaps others are starting to ratchet up the promos a bit? \nLauren Hobart: Beth, we do not -- we are not anticipating nor are we seeing right now any sort of an increase of any meaningful proportion in the promotional environment. When we've looked at the year, in the second half, we have planned for a little bit more of a promotional activity than what we're seeing now but nothing like what we used to see in pre-pandemic levels for all the reasons I said before about the differentiated assortment and the fact that we can be much more surgical with our pricing. \nNavdeep Gupta: And Beth, on your question on the freight, I would say that the freight expenses will continue to remain volatile. We did prioritize inventory availability over cost in fourth quarter, including air freighting of some products. So we'll have to just continue to evaluate that situation. And maybe we may see some favorability as we go into the fourth quarter of this year and don't have to repeat those processes. But that's still much further away, and we'll have to continue to evaluate. \nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush. \nSeth Basham: When you look at your implied gross margin guidance for 2022 of nearly 36%, it's up about 650 basis points since 2019. And then if that's the new foundation on which to grow, can you help us understand the key building blocks to bridge from 2019 to 2022, and, in particular, focus on how much has been driven by better allocations and good relationships with vendors for high-heat products? \nNavdeep Gupta: Seth, this is Navdeep. I'll take that question. First of all, we are very pleased with the results that we have delivered over the last several years. And as Lauren called out, vast majority of this margin increase that we have driven is structural. And the big call out is, if you look at the improvements that we have driven, vast majority of that improvement is in merchandise margin. \n And we won't break this out. But if you look at it, the reason what gives us the confidence is because of the fact that most of this improvement is structural because differentiated assortment, more sophisticated promotion strategy. And the other 2 things that we don't talk as much about, but we have seen a huge improvement in our clearance and price optimization work as well through the data analytics. And those are the things that give us a lot of confidence that -- as well as the hunt penetration which has gone down pretty substantially from where it was in 2019. So that's the reason we believe these are structural, and we'll be able to continue to have these benefits going forward.\n What we did call out in our FY '22 guidance is that we expect some of this -- some giveback to happen because of the promotion as well as the leverage on the fixed expenses. \nSeth Basham: Got it. And specifically, as it relates to high-heat product allocation, would you care to quantify or say how big a driver that's been of the improved structural gross margin that you see going forward? \nLauren Hobart: We're not going to quantify it, but I will go back to what we said over the last 5 years. Our entire portfolio of products has changed and been elevated, and that's all access. It's high-heat product, which we continue to be very pleased with our allocation, but also just highly desirable and coveted product that is across our footwear and apparel and other categories of our stores. So we're very much looking forward to that continuing to help us drive gross margin. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: The debate on the stock is not really about what's going to happen to DICK'S Sporting Goods this year. It's really more about what's going to happen next year, in 2023, and beyond. So if you're starting to see some giveback of the categories that have done really well during the pandemic and experienced inordinate demand and maybe that even extends to footwear and apparel given that consumers have been at home and shifted their wardrobe to more casual wear, why wouldn't sales be down again in 2023 as things return to normalcy? \nLauren Hobart: Michael, yes, it's Lauren. We definitely see future significant share gains available to us in all of the key categories. We -- I mean, evidenced by Q4, we had some pandemic reset of some of those categories, like fitness, as I mentioned before. But our core categories of athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports and golf, we expect to continue to grow due to the assortments, due to our strategic partnerships and due to the fact that we are a clear market leader now in $120 billion marketplace that only has the opportunity to grow. So we -- this is a new base for us. We believe on the top line and the bottom line, we're going to continue to grow, and we're excited for the future. \nMichael Lasser: And then my follow-up question is you mentioned you expect some promotions to return in the second half of this year. Have you assumed that you'll go back to site-wide or store-wide promotions as part of that expectation? \nLauren Hobart: That is not -- we're moving more toward personalized and optimized promotional activity and pricing. I can't see the future, but that's not on my immediate radar screen right now that we will go back to that. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Just curious on your view of the levels of in-transit inventory out there. A lot of the vendors are stuck right now with a lot of in-transit inventory on -- that's recorded on the balance sheet. I'm just curious how you envision product flows and inventory dynamics changing as we get into the back half of the year. \nNavdeep Gupta: John, this is Navdeep. Yes, I think that this is -- we would say, even on the vertical brand side, we had product that was in transit, and this is a little bit of the manifestation of the shutdowns that happened overseas in Q3 and early part of Q4. And so we'll have to just continue to watch. And as we called out in our prepared comments, we feel that the inventory positions will continue to improve as we go through 2022. And we feel that the current level of inventories are appropriate, but we'll have to continue to evaluate the situation and the marketplace as it plays out. But we are very optimistic about the guidance that we have given as well as the inventory levels and building throughout the year. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe just a follow-up on wages and SG&A rates in dollars as we go through this year and into next. Where are you on the wage cycle? Some of your big-box peers have been increasing wages pretty systemically. Just curious when you think about stores and DCs, where we are in terms of labor costs and labor inflation in the model. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. First of all, I would call it that we don't look at the wage minimums as the defining criteria. We look much more as to what is the appropriate wage we have to pay, both in the distribution center and our stores by market to attract the right level of talent. And so it's much more of finding the right talent that can provide that right level of experience to our athlete, which is definitely elevated than a lot of other retailers that are in the marketplace. \n The other thing that I'll call out is we have become an employer of choice. We saw this even in third and fourth quarter where a lot of other retailers were having challenges in staffing their stores, we were very fortunate. The morale, the engagement and the camaraderie that exists in our stores is phenomenal, and that's been one of the core strengths in terms of us continuing to deliver strong results in Q4 as well as in 2021. And we look forward to continuing to maintain that. \nOperator: The final question comes from Sam Poser of Williams Trading. \nSamuel Poser: I have 3. I'm just going to do it real quick. The Nike dropping numerous accounts over the last year, how do you view that as helping your share gain? \n Number two, your inventory is up like 4% versus 2019 and up a lot from last year. What is the optimum inventory? How much are you missing right now based on what you think? \n And the last question I would be able to ask on e-commerce is your e-commerce business is up 80% from pre-COVID levels. Are we looking at sort of a re-basing of this business in that $2.6 billion range? And when you think about next year and going forward, how much of that future, of the growth that you anticipate will be driven from your e-commerce business given this will be the last time I can ask that question? \nLauren Hobart: Sam, all right. I'll take your questions in order, I hope. So starting with Nike and their strategy towards more differentiated retail and the fact that they are narrowing distribution is certainly something as they focus on us as a key strategic partner, and we reinvent the consumer experience together, certainly helped some share gains. \n From an inventory level, I think you raised a really good point that we are turning our inventory very, very quickly, just due to supply chain challenges and inventory challenges. And we do hope, as we go forward, that we will continue to build inventory this year so that we can be even more in stock than we are now. \n With e-commerce, we absolutely expect e-commerce to continue to grow. So you mentioned the base right now of $2.6 billion. We do think that we should be able to continue to grow that. But as we said before in our prepared remarks, the e-comm versus store segmentation is a little bit arbitrary in that there are so many people who are touching multiple channels in any given purchase. But we're very pleased with our omnichannel experience and driving that business. \nSamuel Poser: So let me just one last follow-up. On the inventory, how -- like what would be optimum right now? If you said -- assuming it's the right product, what would be the level that would be optimum at the moment with your inventory around like $2.7 billion? Is that -- yes, in that $2.7 billion range? Is that the way to think about it? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Sam, this is Navdeep. Yes, I would say yes. I don't know if we'll put an exact number to it. We will say that the inventory has definitely not kept pace with the overall sales growth since 2019, and we'll continue to build our inventory position as we go through this year. The big areas that I would call out would be our -- building of the inventory in athletic footwear, apparel. And we feel strong about the in-stocks today, but we feel there is definite opportunities, and we'll look to build as we go into the future. \nSamuel Poser: Okay. And one last one, I'm sorry. The -- how do you prevent yourselves from your eyes getting bigger than your stomach is when you are building for demand going forward given the success? I understand you're going to re-base well above where you were pre-COVID, but how do you prevent yourself from like getting the buyers to start buying too aggressively? Or -- and how do you use the learnings you had to better, more efficiently buy and make sure you don't get ahead of yourself, which has certainly been something that sort of happened by design or not even by design over the last 2 years? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I would say this is one of our absolute core competencies. When we look at how to buy and what demand is, we certainly don't just look at last year. We look at multiple years of history and underlying trends. And I think we've managed it really, really well so far and better than most in the marketplace. So we -- there's very little risk of us getting too aggressive. We are constantly monitoring our open to buy and our investments and chasing where appropriate and managing where we need to pull back. \nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of this call, so I'll hand it back to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, and thanks all for your participation. I just want to reiterate that, at DICK'S, we have been on a transformational journey for the past 5 years, and there are several long-term reasons for our business being as strong as it is which we know will continue into the future. I want to thank our teammates for everything that they've done to drive our results, and thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We had an exceptionally strong 2021 and delivered record sales and earnings. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 26.5%, which was on top of a 9.9% increase from the prior year and 3.7% increase in 2019. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $15.70 represented a 157% increase over last year and a 325% increase over 2019. \n Our current success is the result of a deliberate multiyear transformational journey that is driving sustainable sales and profitability growth. With an athlete-first approach, we have built significant competitive advantages across our merchandise assortment, brand relationships, service model, in-store and digital commerce experiences. We have also invested in our technology capabilities, including data science, personalization, to advance our omnichannel growth strategy. Virtually nothing about our business is the same as it was 5 years ago. \n As expected, 2021 has been the most transformational year in our company's history. Among our accomplishments, we drove strong growth in our core DICK'S business; launched DICK'S House of Sport, a completely new experiential destination that's redefining sports retail; we reengineered Golf Galaxy and launched the Golf Galaxy Performance Center, a new immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels; and finally, we unveiled Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept, to better serve the outdoor athlete. \n We are the clear market leader in a fragmented $120 billion industry with strong secular growth trends. Our strategies are working, and we've set our business on a new trajectory for growth. We'll continue to take market share and extend our lead. We have the best overall management team we've ever had and are entering 2022 stronger than ever. Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the future of our business. \n Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Lauren."

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Ed's thanks to our team for their incredible passion, hard work and dedication to our athletes and to our business. At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great, and none of what has been accomplished this past year would have been possible without our exceptional team. \n Now on to our results. In Q4, we delivered the largest sales quarter in our company's history. Our record quarterly sales of $3.35 billion were driven by a consolidated same-store sales increase of nearly 6%, which was on top of a 19.3% increase in the same period last year and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 comps were supported by growth in key categories and increases in both average ticket and transactions as our diverse category and brand portfolio, world-class omnichannel platform and strong execution helped us continue to meet robust consumer demand. \n Our athlete counts remain strong, and we added another 2.3 million new athletes during the quarter for a total of approximately 8 million new athletes acquired this year. Our highly differentiated product assortment, combined with our granular and disciplined promotion management, is enabling us to drive significantly higher merch margin rates. During the quarter, there were no major store or site-wide promotions, and we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 476 basis points versus 2020 and by 848 basis points versus 2019. Led by strong sales and merchandise margin, we achieved non-GAAP EBT margin of nearly 14%. In total, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64 represented a 50% increase over the same period last year and a 176% increase over Q4 of 2019. \n As Ed indicated, over the past 5 years, we've been on a transformational journey that's driving sustainable growth in sales and profitability. During this time, we meaningfully improved our merchandise assortment, including developing even stronger relationships with our key brand partners to drive greater access to highly differentiated product. \n We implemented an enhanced service model and leaned into highly engaging in-store experiences. We focused on our culture and put our teammates, athletes and communities at the center of everything we do. Finally, we invested in technology, data science and our omnichannel platform and significantly improved our digital marketing and personalization capabilities. These transformational changes were driving improved results well before the pandemic and further accelerated our performance over the past 2 years. \n DICK'S is a growth company. And with the recent completion of our $1.5 billion long-term investment-grade debt issuance, we have ample flexibility to pursue our robust growth agenda. We're entering 2022 with incredible momentum and confidence in our business. Virtually our entire category portfolio has re-baselined meaningfully higher versus pre-COVID sales levels. We've gained considerable market share in key categories. And as the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, we are well positioned to extend our lead and continue gaining share in a large, growing and fragmented industry. \n Importantly, our 2022 sales and earnings guidance establishes a new foundation upon which we will build in the years ahead. Navdeep will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks. Our focus in 2022 is on enhancing our existing strategies to continue to accelerate our core business and enable long-term profitable growth. First, our stores will continue to be the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. \n During 2021, our stores comped up 42%, including a 14% increase in Q4. They enabled over 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online line sales through either ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. In 2022, we will continue to enhance our service model and provide opportunities to try products through experiential elements, such as our premium full-service footwear decks, our HitTrax batting cages, soccer shops and golf simulators. We will also continue to invest in technology to enhance our store fulfillment and in-store pickup capabilities and drive profitability of our e-commerce business. \n Beyond our stores, we will also continue to improve our digital experience by adding more personalization and making it even easier for athletes to find the best product for them. Backed by our investments in service, data science and our ScoreCard Program, we will continue to serve our athletes whenever, wherever and however they want, instilling confidence in their purchase and inspiring their loyalty. \n Next within merchandising. Our relationships with key brands are stronger than ever, and we will build on our momentum and drive growth in important categories, including athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf. We are rooted in sport, and our ability to showcase an entire brand portfolio across our national store footprint and online is highly valued by our strategic partners. \n In 2021, we announced a groundbreaking new partnership with Nike to create an unmatched experience for our connected athletes. We've been encouraged by the athlete response and look forward to continually working with Nike to anticipate and fulfill the evolving needs of the athletes we serve. Looking ahead, we will continue to make big bets with all of our big brand partners to deliver an unparalleled athlete experience across our physical and digital properties. \n At the same time, we will leverage athlete feedback and insights to drive vertical brand growth in new segments and categories. As we've discussed on previous calls, our vertical brands have become a significant source of strength and growth. During 2021, our vertical brands eclipsed $1.7 billion in sales, and together, represented our largest brand in golf, team sports, fitness and outdoor equipment. \n Finally, we remain very pleased by the early results of our new concepts and experiences, including DICK'S House of Sport, Golf Galaxy Performance Center and Public Lands. We're excited to continue to refine and grow these concepts while pulling key learnings into our core business. \n In closing, I want to reiterate that our record performance in 2021 was the result of our deliberate investments, our emphasis on analyzing, understanding and meeting the evolving needs of our athletes and the tremendous execution from our team. We are very confident about the ongoing long-term growth potential of our business and believe that no one is better positioned to lead in the marketplace. \n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I'll take that, Simeon. Thank you for the question. From a margin standpoint, we do believe that the vast majority of our merch margin improvements over time are sustainable. We do expect some normalization of promotions, but what's really driving that is a complete change in our merchandising assortment, such that we now have products that are highly differentiated and not really subject to a vast promotional environment. \n And so what if it's more than some? I mean, we will be managing our pricing and our promotions as we do, looking every day at what the right prices to our customers and for our business, and we expect to be able to drive significant continued margin gains versus where we were prepandemic. Yes, Simeon, I think it's a few key things. First of all, as I mentioned, it is the differentiated product assortment that is not a subject because some of the products are more high-heat and desirable products. They're not a subject to a promotional environment. But at the same time, we also have evolved our marketing mix from what used to be a fully print-based plan where we would have to make decisions on pricing and promotion many weeks before understanding what the market was going to be like, to a much more digital and flexible environment now.\n And we also have stepped away from the business of being promotional on a total site-wide or store-wide level because we can now be much more personalized and granular in terms of our offers with direct customer messaging. So we absolutely feel there are structural things in our gross margin that are going to set us up to permanently retain this higher level. Thank you. Thanks, Adrienne. So starting off with the Nike partnership. Our relationship with Nike is at an all-time high, and I would say it's become incredibly strategic in that we are reinventing together what the customer experience is. We started that over the past several years and most recently with our connected membership program, where consumers can opt in to both a DICK'S and Nike membership, and that unlocks tremendous amount of access to products for them, experiences and content.\n And so I do believe we will continue to innovate with Nike, spend in co-marketing as we have and really reinvent the consumer experience. I would say that that's true of all of our strategic partners. We have many strategic partners, if you look at our co-creation model with Adidas and Under Armour and tremendous strategic partnerships with Callaway and TaylorMade. \n To answer your specific question about Nike and what percentage of sales they were for this past year, they were 17% of our mix. Navdeep? You take the first, Navdeep, and I'll take the second. And regarding our category performance in 2021 versus 2019, I think it's really important to note that we have increased our sales in every single category over -- meaningfully over 2019 with the exception of hunt, which is a result of a long-term strategy. But every single category has re-baselined significantly higher. We saw, in 2021, incredible strength in our -- what I would say is our core businesses, so team sports, athletic apparel, athletic footwear and golf. I'll even point out golf in this past year had a record number of rounds played. So we have a lot of confidence in those categories. And then in some of the \"pandemic-surging categories\" like fitness and bikes, while there's some rightsizing going on, they are significantly higher than they were in 2019. But Warren, I do want to also mention, Navdeep mentioned in his opening remarks, that we do think, across the board, this is a new base from which we can grow in the future, our sales and our margin rates. Our brand relationships are at an all-time high. We are having incredibly strategic discussions with every key brand partner we have in key categories, and that's across athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports. We are also working with new and emerging brands, as we always have, and continue to take bets on emerging players. \n But over -- across the board, I would say some -- part of the reason for this elevated expectation that we have is our relationships with our brand partners are at an all-time high. We're getting better allocation, and they are narrowing distribution, and we are working with them to reinvent the consumer experience. Yes. From an assortment standpoint, our vertical brands remain very, very strong. We're over $1.7 billion. We're getting very strong growth out of our vertical brands, and we continue to use those brands to fill in opportunities across our portfolio. Brands like DSG, which brings in an opening price point; and CALIA, which attracts the female -- athletic female; and then VRST, our new men's apparel brand, all fill white space that was missing in our portfolio before. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So the new debt we just raised, we're very pleased. We raised $1.5 billion investment-grade debt, which just gives us an incredible amount of opportunity to invest in our business and growth. So first and foremost, we are going to maintain what we would consider an appropriate cash balance and always make sure that we can weather any storm. We're also going to invest heavily in our business, be that new store expansion, real estate and in-store experience, as well as technology. And then lastly, of course, we will look to return excess cash flow to shareholders in various ways.\n So in terms of our store count growth and our CapEx, store counts, we are expecting 11 new DICK'S stores this coming year -- actually 11 new stores, period, 4 DICK'S and 7 specialty and 11 remodel stores, including 1 House of Sport and 1 Golf Galaxy Performance Center. And our CapEx will support all the activities I mentioned before in in-store and real estate and technology. Yes. We were very, very pleased with our January performance, as you note, as we did indicate what our forecast was in the early weeks of January. What happened to drive those results even higher is that we had an improved inventory level versus our expectations, just given our really strong promotional management throughout the earlier months in the quarter. And then we also had a significant impact of cold weather that drove a lot of outerwear business in January. So we were very pleased. Overall, we were pleased with January versus our forecast and also versus 2 years ago. It performed very, very well. Yes. House of Sport is a fully experiential destination with a tremendous service model, community involvement, different fitting room experience and all those things we are pulling back into the DICK'S -- all of the DICK'S stores when we look at how we want to serve athletes and different experiences that we want to build into. You'll see us continuing to grow things of an experiential nature in our stores, so increased soccer shops, increased premium footwear decks. We've already -- we've got HitTrax in many of our stores. But most importantly, I think the service model has become really emblematic of how we want to serve athletes. \n With Public Lands, we have really -- we're excited about the learnings that we're getting about the outdoor category and the consumer that we feel is underserved there. We've got brand partnerships that we're very excited about developing, which can come back to DICK'S and just a general focus on the outdoor business in DICK'S Sporting Goods. So we haven't put a number on how much inventory constraints impacted Q4. But I will say, for the last 2 years, there have been inventory challenges, supply chain challenges, constraints. And what I think we've proven with the 5.9% comp that we just delivered in Q4 is that despite some inventory constraints, we have a broad portfolio, we can offer some substitutions when we don't have the exact products that people wanted and that we can manage really well. And we will expect to do that through any choppiness that's coming through the next year. Beth, we do not -- we are not anticipating nor are we seeing right now any sort of an increase of any meaningful proportion in the promotional environment. When we've looked at the year, in the second half, we have planned for a little bit more of a promotional activity than what we're seeing now but nothing like what we used to see in pre-pandemic levels for all the reasons I said before about the differentiated assortment and the fact that we can be much more surgical with our pricing. We're not going to quantify it, but I will go back to what we said over the last 5 years. Our entire portfolio of products has changed and been elevated, and that's all access. It's high-heat product, which we continue to be very pleased with our allocation, but also just highly desirable and coveted product that is across our footwear and apparel and other categories of our stores. So we're very much looking forward to that continuing to help us drive gross margin. Michael, yes, it's Lauren. We definitely see future significant share gains available to us in all of the key categories. We -- I mean, evidenced by Q4, we had some pandemic reset of some of those categories, like fitness, as I mentioned before. But our core categories of athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports and golf, we expect to continue to grow due to the assortments, due to our strategic partnerships and due to the fact that we are a clear market leader now in $120 billion marketplace that only has the opportunity to grow. So we -- this is a new base for us. We believe on the top line and the bottom line, we're going to continue to grow, and we're excited for the future. That is not -- we're moving more toward personalized and optimized promotional activity and pricing. I can't see the future, but that's not on my immediate radar screen right now that we will go back to that. Sam, all right. I'll take your questions in order, I hope. So starting with Nike and their strategy towards more differentiated retail and the fact that they are narrowing distribution is certainly something as they focus on us as a key strategic partner, and we reinvent the consumer experience together, certainly helped some share gains. \n From an inventory level, I think you raised a really good point that we are turning our inventory very, very quickly, just due to supply chain challenges and inventory challenges. And we do hope, as we go forward, that we will continue to build inventory this year so that we can be even more in stock than we are now. \n With e-commerce, we absolutely expect e-commerce to continue to grow. So you mentioned the base right now of $2.6 billion. We do think that we should be able to continue to grow that. But as we said before in our prepared remarks, the e-comm versus store segmentation is a little bit arbitrary in that there are so many people who are touching multiple channels in any given purchase. But we're very pleased with our omnichannel experience and driving that business. Yes. I would say this is one of our absolute core competencies. When we look at how to buy and what demand is, we certainly don't just look at last year. We look at multiple years of history and underlying trends. And I think we've managed it really, really well so far and better than most in the marketplace. So we -- there's very little risk of us getting too aggressive. We are constantly monitoring our open to buy and our investments and chasing where appropriate and managing where we need to pull back. Thank you, and thanks all for your participation. I just want to reiterate that, at DICK'S, we have been on a transformational journey for the past 5 years, and there are several long-term reasons for our business being as strong as it is which we know will continue into the future. I want to thank our teammates for everything that they've done to drive our results, and thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2021 results. Consolidated sales increased 28.3% to $12.29 billion. As Ed noted, consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 26.5%. This was on top of a 9.9% increase last year and a 3.7% increase in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, our online business has grown from 16% in 2019 to 21% in the current year. \n Gross profit for full year was $4.71 billion or 38.33% of net sales and improved 650 basis points from last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 407 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 223 basis points. We also saw lower shipping expense as a percentage of sales. This was due to sustained strength in our brick-and-mortar sales and higher brick-and-mortar sales penetration, following last year's temporary store closures. These items were partially offset by higher freight costs, resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability. \n SG&A expenses were $2.66 billion or 21.67% of net sales and leveraged 231 basis points from last year, primarily due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $366 million, primarily due to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales, as well as last year's operating expense reduction following our temporary store closures. In the prior year, SG&A included $152 million of COVID-related compensation and safety cost. However, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation program with a longer-term focus, including increasing and accelerating annual merit and higher hourly wages, partially reinvesting last year's COVID-related costs. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $2.03 billion or 16.47% of net sales and increased $1.29 billion or 882 basis points from the same period last year. In total, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $15.70. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.12 last year, a 157% year-over-year increase and a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.69 in 2019, a 325% increase. \n Now moving to our Q4 results. We are pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.3% to $3.35 billion. As Lauren said, this was the largest sales quarter in our history. Consolidated same-store sales increased 5.9% on top of a 19.3% increase in the same period last year and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019. Our strong comps were driven by growth in team sports, apparel and footwear, as well as a 4.8% increase in average ticket and a 1.1% increase in transactions. When compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 28.5%, driven by balanced growth across our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear. \n Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 14% versus 2020 and delivered a 24% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage. As expected, our e-commerce sales decreased 11% versus last year, which was on top of a 57% increase in Q4 of 2020. This reflects our deliberate decision to minimize site-wide promotion to better manage our inventory throughout the quarter. Compared to 2019, e-commerce sales increased 39%. And as a percentage of net sales, our online business has grown from 25% in 2019 to 27% in current quarter. E-commerce penetration was 32% last year. \n Now moving to gross profit. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.26 billion or 37.58% of net sales and improved 391 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 476 basis points, primarily due to fewer promotions, the result of our increasingly differentiated assortment and disciplined promotional strategies. In addition, certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained, which resulted in a reduced promotional environment. We also saw a favorable sales mix. As expected, these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs, resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability. \n Compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved 898 basis points. This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 848 basis points due to fewer promotions and favorable sales mix, as well as leverage on fixed occupancy costs, partially offset by higher freight costs. \n SG&A expenses were $783.6 million or 23.38% of net sales and leveraged 97 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to increase in sales. SG&A dollars increased $22 million, primarily due to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales. In the prior year quarter, SG&A included $47 million of COVID-related compensation and safety costs, as well as $30 million donation we made to DICK'S Foundation to help jump start youth sports program struggling to make comeback in the pandemic, most of which was in Q4. As I mentioned previously, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation programs with a longer-term focus, partially reinvesting last year's COVID-related cost. \n Compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales deleveraged 45 basis points, primarily due to the increase in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales, as well as hourly wage rate investments and higher advertising to support our new concepts. \n Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $468.4 million or 13.97% of net sales and increased approximately $170 million or 442 basis points from the same period last year. Compared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $319.8 million or 827 basis points as a percentage of net sales. \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 last year, a 50% increase on a year-over-year basis and a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32 in 2019, a 176% increase. \n On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.16. This included $8.1 million in noncash interest expense, as well as 12.6 million additional diluted shares that are designed to be offset by our bond hedge at settlement but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation, both related to our convertible notes we issued in Q1 2020. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. In January, we were very pleased to complete our inaugural long-term investment-grade debt transaction, raising $1.5 billion of cash through the issuance of our senior unsecured notes. As a result, we have further strengthened our financial position, providing us the flexibility to continue investing in our business, as well as repay the $575 million of convertible senior notes. \n We ended Q4 with approximately $2.64 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our new $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter ended inventory levels increased 17.6% compared to Q4 of last year. Looking ahead, we continue to aggressively chase product to meet demand and prioritize inventory availability over cost. As part of this, we expect elevated freight expenses to continue and have included the impact of this within our 2022 outlook. \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $64.7 million, and we paid $35.7 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares of our stock for $750 million at an average price of $110.72. We have approximately $1.85 billion remaining under our new $2 billion share repurchase program. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through the share repurchases and dividends. \n Now let me move to our fiscal 2022 outlook for sales and earnings. Coming off 2 consecutive record years in 2020 and 2021, our 2022 expectations provide a new foundation upon which we will build in the years ahead. As Ed said, our strategies are working, and they have set us on a new trajectory. Let us now review the details of 2022 sales and earnings and capital allocation in detail. \n Consolidated same-store sales are expected to be in the range of negative 4% to flat with quarterly comps expected to improve sequentially throughout the year. This is on top of a 26.5% comp sales increase in 2021 and a 9.9% increase in 2020 on as-reported basis. EBT is expected to be in the range of $1.43 billion and $1.6 billion. This includes approximately $55 million of pretax interest expense associated with our new $1.5 billion long-term debt. At the midpoint, EBT margin is expected to be approximately 12.5%.\n Within this, gross margin is expected to decline approximately 250 basis points at the midpoint. This assumes some normalization of promotional landscape, higher freight expenses and modest deleverage on fixed expenses. SG&A expense is expected to deleverage, primarily due to hourly wage rate investments, as well as investments in advertising, talent and technology to fund our growth strategies. In total, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $13.10. \n Our earnings guidance is based on 94 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditures of $340 million to $365 million, which will be concentrated in improvements in our existing stores, ongoing investments in technology as well as new store growth. \n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends of 11% to $0.4875 per share or $1.95 on an annualized basis. In addition, our plan includes a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider using our expected strong free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $200 million.\n Before concluding, I'd like to take a moment to highlight an upcoming change in our disclosures. Beginning in Q1 2022, we will be moving away from providing e-commerce sales growth and penetration metrics. Our athletes are increasingly shopping across multiple channels on the same transaction, and it no longer makes sense to try and attribute a sale to a specific channel. And with EBT margins being similar, regardless of an online versus in-person transaction, the difference is even less relevant from a modeling perspective. \n We believe the single view of the consumer and of our business best represents our omnichannel approach, which centers around serving our athletes whenever, wherever and however they want to shop. As you know, we previously announced our intent to make the shift in 2020 but delayed as a result of COVID-19 and related temporary store closures. We will continue to provide consolidated same-store sales results with an updated method, as Nate described in his introduction. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 results. We are now looking forward to continuing this success in 2022 and over the longer term. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yes. Adrienne, thanks for your question. I think maybe I'll answer both questions together. When we created our budget, the geopolitical situations were not what they are right now, so we'll continue to watch how these situations evolve. In terms of the demand, I'll start with that, and then I'll come to the oil prices. We feel strongly about the demand. We have seen a sustained level of demand, both even in Q4 and all through 2021.\n When we look at the macro changes, we are seeing that those are still very lasting. The lifestyle changes that our athletes have made in terms of focus on the health and fitness, the greater participation in the outdoor activities, as well as casualization of the workplace, that trend has continued to remain elevated. \n And what I -- what Lauren called out, right, the brand partnerships that we have, the allocations that we are getting, as well as the capabilities that we have built internally to be able to kind of capture the demand gives us a lot of confidence. \n And then on the -- in terms of the oil prices, we looked at the -- when we created the budget, as you can imagine, that was at the beginning of this year, we used the market prices as part of our budget expectation, and we'll closely monitor the situation as the year evolves in terms of our financial expectations. But we are very optimistic in the guidance that we have given based on the time and place when the budgets were created. Paul, this is Navdeep. I'll take the first question. Like I called out in our guidance, we are expecting the comps to sequentially improve. I think to one of the factors you called out, which is the stimulus impact, the stimulus impact, I would say, was much more in March through the May time frame. And so as we kind of lap that in Q1, that expectation has been included in our guidance. As well as, as we look to the inventory position, we believe that will continue to improve. We finished strongly at the end of Q4 of 2021. However, we are continuing to build our inventory as we go into the peak selling season here. So we believe that the inventory position, as well as the lapping of the stimulus money from last year, is what we have called out that we expect our comps to sequentially improve as we move through the year. Yes. Warren, this is Navdeep. I'll take this question. So in terms of the freight expenses, what we have called out is that we expect the freight expenses to remain elevated, even in 2022. So there's not much of a decline that we are expecting in freight expenses. At least as of now, we can't see that playing out in the marketplace. \n The reduction in the gross margin that we have called out is primarily related to the normalization of the promotions environment and some deleverage as well on the fixed expenses with the midpoint of the comp guidance that we have given. Kate, this is Navdeep. I'll take the first one in terms of the build for FY '22. So maybe I'll begin a little bit with what we saw in Q4. So the vast majority of our Q4 comp was driven by ticket. But actually, if you'll peel that a little bit further, what you see is that there was a strong growth that we saw in transactions in our store, and the ticket increase was actually driven by our decision to be not promotional in the e-comm and in our stores. \n So as we look to 2022, we will constantly continue to evaluate what is the right strategy of balancing our -- kind of the needs of the athlete as well as what is the right decision from a marketplace perspective. And in terms of -- we haven't given this level of granularity, but I would say that we expect that the tickets will continue to be stronger as we look to '22. However, transactions will also remain strong as we have seen a good experience and the traction with our brick-and-mortar business as well as e-comm. Chuck, this is Navdeep. I'll take that question. First of all, we are very excited about the results that we have delivered over the last couple of years but actually, as Ed called out, the transformation journey we have been on for the last 5 years. And what gives us the confidence as we look to the future are the things that, like Lauren called out, the changes and the improvements that we have made are so foundational to our success over the last few years, and that's what gives us the confidence as we look to the future as well. \n In terms of an EBT margin, we have improved our sales over. If you just look at pre-pandemic, our sales are up $3 billion. Our earnings, even with the midpoint of guidance, will be up over $1 billion from where they were. So we are really excited about the results, and we feel like we can continue to create this in '22 as a new foundation and continue to grow our sales and profitability on a long-term basis. Yes. Chris, great question. I don't think so we will dispute anything that you called out. But like we called out in my prepared remarks, the $200 million is a minimum that we called out. So as we look to this year, we will evaluate all available options to us, whether to do an incremental opportunistic share buyback as well as we'll definitely look into a convert, as we have called out. And you know that these notes are callable next year and -- but still, the maturity is still further quite a ways away. So we'll continue to evaluate all opportunities available to us, and at the same time, continue to maintain an appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet because the uncertainties in the world are not behind us. And Beth, on your question on the freight, I would say that the freight expenses will continue to remain volatile. We did prioritize inventory availability over cost in fourth quarter, including air freighting of some products. So we'll have to just continue to evaluate that situation. And maybe we may see some favorability as we go into the fourth quarter of this year and don't have to repeat those processes. But that's still much further away, and we'll have to continue to evaluate. Seth, this is Navdeep. I'll take that question. First of all, we are very pleased with the results that we have delivered over the last several years. And as Lauren called out, vast majority of this margin increase that we have driven is structural. And the big call out is, if you look at the improvements that we have driven, vast majority of that improvement is in merchandise margin. \n And we won't break this out. But if you look at it, the reason what gives us the confidence is because of the fact that most of this improvement is structural because differentiated assortment, more sophisticated promotion strategy. And the other 2 things that we don't talk as much about, but we have seen a huge improvement in our clearance and price optimization work as well through the data analytics. And those are the things that give us a lot of confidence that -- as well as the hunt penetration which has gone down pretty substantially from where it was in 2019. So that's the reason we believe these are structural, and we'll be able to continue to have these benefits going forward.\n What we did call out in our FY '22 guidance is that we expect some of this -- some giveback to happen because of the promotion as well as the leverage on the fixed expenses. John, this is Navdeep. Yes, I think that this is -- we would say, even on the vertical brand side, we had product that was in transit, and this is a little bit of the manifestation of the shutdowns that happened overseas in Q3 and early part of Q4. And so we'll have to just continue to watch. And as we called out in our prepared comments, we feel that the inventory positions will continue to improve as we go through 2022. And we feel that the current level of inventories are appropriate, but we'll have to continue to evaluate the situation and the marketplace as it plays out. But we are very optimistic about the guidance that we have given as well as the inventory levels and building throughout the year. Yes. First of all, I would call it that we don't look at the wage minimums as the defining criteria. We look much more as to what is the appropriate wage we have to pay, both in the distribution center and our stores by market to attract the right level of talent. And so it's much more of finding the right talent that can provide that right level of experience to our athlete, which is definitely elevated than a lot of other retailers that are in the marketplace. \n The other thing that I'll call out is we have become an employer of choice. We saw this even in third and fourth quarter where a lot of other retailers were having challenges in staffing their stores, we were very fortunate. The morale, the engagement and the camaraderie that exists in our stores is phenomenal, and that's been one of the core strengths in terms of us continuing to deliver strong results in Q4 as well as in 2021. And we look forward to continuing to maintain that. Yes. Sam, this is Navdeep. Yes, I would say yes. I don't know if we'll put an exact number to it. We will say that the inventory has definitely not kept pace with the overall sales growth since 2019, and we'll continue to build our inventory position as we go through this year. The big areas that I would call out would be our -- building of the inventory in athletic footwear, apparel. And we feel strong about the in-stocks today, but we feel there is definite opportunities, and we'll look to build as we go into the future."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2021 results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Executive Chairman and Chief Merchandising Officer; Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months. \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. \n And finally, a few admin items. First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. Our consolidated same-store sales calculation includes stores that we chose to temporarily close last year as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers. \n Next, as a reminder, due to the uneven nature of 2020, we planned 2021 off a 2019 baseline. Accordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020. And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our second quarter 2021 earnings results before the market opens on August 25, 2021, with our subsequent earnings call at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed. \nEdward Stack: Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased to announce yet another quarter of record results as we continue to execute at a very high level and capitalize on incredibly strong consumer demand. We're in a great lane right now, and 2021 will be our boldest and most transformational year in the company's history. We believe the future of retail is experiential, powered by technology and a world-class omnichannel operating model. \n Importantly, we are reimagining the athlete experience both across our core business and through new concepts that we have been working on for the past several years, which will collectively propel our growth in the future. We recently debuted DICK'S House of Sport in Rochester, New York. It's off to a great start and is on track to become among our highest-volume stores in the chain. We have reimagined virtually everything in the store and believe it sets the standard for sport retailing and athlete engagement. Our partners who have visited the store all agree there's nothing like it, and we hope everyone has the opportunity to see it in person. \n Next, we are completely reengineering our Golf Galaxy business. The game of golf is in great shape and our golf business has been tremendous. With Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters, we're leaning into this streak by investing in our Golf Galaxy business and adding TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience. We are also investing in talent to elevate the in-store service model and are remodeling 18 stores this year. The new stores we've remodeled are showing promising results. Looking ahead, we expect golf to have a long runway, and we are committed to leveraging this momentum for future growth within our business. \n Additionally, we are launching Public Lands, a complete outdoor omnichannel retail concept that will focus on making the outdoor as a place where everyone feels welcome and inspired. We've been working on Public Lands for several years and look forward to opening our first 2 stores later this year. Based on our research, we think there is an opportunity in the marketplace and believe this new concept will be a great growth vehicle for us. \n Importantly, conservation will play a prominent role in our new Public Lands concept, and we will champion environmental issues as we speak up to protect the planet and our public lands. As a member of the outdoor industry, we have also joined forces with other retailers to advocate for conserving 30% of the U.S. lands and waters by 2030. We expect to have the same voice and as much impact on these issues as we've had inside the DICK'S business, highlighting the youth sports crisis and sensible gun legislation. We'll be sharing more details about our plans for Public Lands in the weeks and months ahead. \n In closing, you can see DICK'S is a growth company, and we will continue to invest in our business to grow our lead as the nation's largest sport retailer. We see significant growth opportunities within DICK'S and Golf Galaxy as well as with House of Sport and Public Lands. We will continue to invest in our vertical brands and with our key partners, including Nike, North Face, Callaway, TaylorMade and others to elevate the athlete experience across the stores and online.  \n This morning, as Lauren and Lee discuss the results of our strategic growth drivers in greater detail, I couldn't be more excited about our business and more proud of our team and their unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter, achieving record first quarter sales and our highest-ever quarterly earnings, both significantly exceeding our expectations. Our Q1 consolidated same-store sales increased 115% as we anniversaried the majority of our temporary store closures from last year. The strength of our diverse category portfolio, supply chain, technology capabilities and omnichannel execution helped us continue to capitalize on strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle.  \n We also saw a resurgence in our team sports business as kids began to get back out on the field after a year in which many youth sports activities were delayed or canceled. Our strong comps were supported by sales growth of over 100% within each of our 3 primary categories: the hardlines, apparel and footwear as well as increases in both average ticket and transactions. Like others, we also benefited from the recent stimulus checks. These results combined translate to a 52% sales increase when compared -- combined -- sorry, when compared to the first quarter of 2019.  \n From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores generated significant triple-digit comps and importantly delivered an approximate 40% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14%, which was on top of our 110% online sales increase in the same period last year when the vast majority of our stores were closed for over 6 weeks. This represented nearly a 140% increase when compared to 2019.  \n Within eCommerce, in-store pickup and curbside continued to be a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering, increasing approximately 500% when compared to BOPIS sales during the first quarter of 2019. And as a percent of online sales, we saw sequential growth compared to the second half of last year. These same-day services, along with ship-from-store, are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment.  \n During Q1, our stores enabled approximately 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales through either ship-from-store, in-store pickup or curbside. Throughout the quarter, we remained disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence as certain categories in the marketplace continued to be supply constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 787 basis points versus 2020 and 312 basis points versus 2019. This merchandise margin expansion, along with substantial leverage on fixed costs, drove a significant improvement in gross margin.  \n In total, our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 not only represented a 511% increase over Q1 2019 but eclipsed our full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.59. During the first quarter last year, we recorded a net loss per share of $1.71 as we temporarily closed our stores to promote the safety of our teammates, athletes and communities.  \n Looking ahead, we remain very enthusiastic about our business, and we're raising our full year sales and earnings guidance. Our financial outlook balances this enthusiasm with the uncertainties that still exist, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year. Lee will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks.  \n Now let me provide a few updates on our strategic growth drivers. First, within merchandising, our well-defined brand strategy drives differentiation and exclusivity within our assortment as we leverage both our key national brand partnerships and our highly profitable and growing vertical brand portfolio. During the quarter, our vertical brands continued to be a significant source of strength, posting triple-digit comps, with merchandise margin rate expansion that outperformed the company average.  \n We saw sustained success in DSG, our largest vertical brand, as well as in CALIA, our second-largest women's athletic apparel brand. This year, we are investing to make our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in store and increased marketing. In March, we augmented our men's athletic apparel selection by launching VRST, our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male. The team has done a great job with VRST and is off to a really strong start.  \n Next, to increase engagement with our athletes, we're taking steps to dial up service in our stores and to make our stores more experiential. As Ed mentioned, we've been very pleased with the early results from our first DICK'S House of Sport and are excited for the grand opening of our second location in Knoxville next week. Virtually everything in House of Sport is new, from our engagement and service models to our merchandising standards, brands and concept shops, as well as an adjacent outdoor field to host sports events and promote product trial. These highly experiential stores are exploring the future of retail, and they provide us a great opportunity to test and learn. We'll continue to refine and grow the House of Sport concept while also rolling the most successful elements into our core DICK'S stores.  \n Beyond House of Sport, we continue to evolve the DICK'S athlete experience. During the quarter, we added more than 30 soccer shops that provide a high level of service from in-store soccer experts who are especially trained to help athletes find the equipment and cleats they need to excel at the game. The soccer shops also feature a variety of updated in-store elements, including an elevated cleat shop, an expanded selection of licensed jerseys and soccer trial cages in select locations. We've been pleased with the initial results and plan to add additional shops throughout the year.  \n As discussed on prior calls, footwear is a key pillar of our merchandising strategy. And during the quarter, we converted more than 40 additional stores to premium full-service footwear. Over 50 more stores will be converted by the end of the year, taking this experience to approximately 60% of the DICK'S chain.  \n Lastly, as the #1 premium golf retailer in the world, we are benefiting from renewed interest in the game. Participation rates are healthy and energy for the game of golf continues to increase, with women, juniors and young adults contributing to the game's growth. As a result of this robust demand, our golf business has been great at both DICK'S and Golf Galaxy, with Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters.  \n In 2021, we're investing over $20 million to transform our Golf Galaxy stores via a combination of elevated experience, industry-leading technology and unmatched expertise through our certified PGA and LPGA professionals. As part of this, we rolled out TrackMan technology to over 80% of the chain to enhance the fitting and lesson experience. We've also completely redesigned nearly 20 stores.  \n In addition, we enabled online booking of lessons and club fittings and invested in talent and training to elevate our in-store service model. We supported these efforts through our first Golf Galaxy-specific brand campaign, Better Your Best, across TV, social and in-store.  \n Now moving to our omnichannel capabilities. We continue to drive significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel through fewer promotions, leverage of fixed costs and strong athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside. We're continuing to enhance the curbside experience with new features like proxy pickup as well as through improved inventory availability and reduced pickup wait time for athletes.  \n During Q1, over 90% of curbside orders were ready within 15 minutes and upon check-in at the store, 50% were delivered to the athlete's car in under 2.5 minutes. Looking ahead, we continue to expect curbside pickup will remain a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering as our athletes turn to this service for speed and convenience.  \n Along with curbside, our ScoreCard Program continues to be a key to our omnichannel offering with more than 20 million active members who drive over 70% of our sales. We're using data science to drive more personalized marketing and engagement with our athletes, which is resulting in strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year. Speaking of new athletes, we acquired nearly 2 million new athletes this past quarter, and relative to our existing athletes, they continue to skew younger and more female, representing a great opportunity for future growth.  \n In closing, we are a growth company steeped in technology and omnichannel experience with a bold path forward. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we are enthusiastic about our business and confident that our investments will strengthen our leadership position within the marketplace. I had the pleasure of visiting many of our stores during this first quarter, and I would like to thank our teammates across the company for their continued hard work, collaborative spirit and passion for serving our athletes and supporting our business. I will now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nLee Belitsky: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales increased 119% to approximately $2.92 billion. Including the impact of last year's temporary store closures, consolidated same-store sales increased 115%. This increase was broad-based with each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear comping up over 100%. Transactions increased 90% and average ticket increased 25%. Compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 52%.  \n Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up nearly 190% as we anniversaried last year's temporary store closures, and compared to 2019, increased approximately 40% with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14% over last year and increased 139% versus 2019. As a percent of total net sales, our online business was 20%. As expected, this decreased from the 39% of net sales in 2020, given last year's temporary store closures, but increased compared to the 13% we had in 2019.  \n Lastly, in terms of stimulus, while this can be difficult to quantify, we recognize that our athletes had more cash to spend during the quarter and believe we benefited from this during the first quarter.  \n Gross profit in the first quarter was $1.09 billion or 37.3% of net sales and improved approximately 2,100 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of approximately 1,000 basis points from the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 787 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions and a favorable sales mix. Additionally, last year included $28 million of inventory write-downs resulting from our temporary store closures, which were subsequently recovered in the second quarter of 2020 due to better-than-anticipated sales and margin on merchandise nearing the end of life upon the reopening of our stores.  \n The balance of the improvement was driven by lower shipping expense as a percent of net sales due to higher brick-and-mortar store sales penetration following last year's temporary store closures. Compared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of sales improved by 795 basis points, driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 475 basis points due to the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 312 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions.  \n SG&A expenses were $608.3 million or 20.84% of net sales and leveraged 940 basis points compared to last year due to significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $205.1 million, of which $21 million is attributable to the expense recognition associated with changes in our deferred compensation plan investment values. This expense is fully offset in other income and has no impact on net earnings. The remaining $183 million is primarily due to normalization of expenses following our temporary store closures last year to support the increase in sales as well as higher incentive compensation expenses due to our strong first quarter results.  \n SG&A expenses include $13 million of COVID-related safety costs, which in light of the latest CDC guidance, we expect these costs to decline significantly beginning in the second quarter. Compared to 2019's non-GAAP results, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales leveraged 446 basis points from -- due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $122.3 million due to increases in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales and hourly wage rate investments and COVID-related safety costs as well as higher incentive compensation expenses.  \n Driven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, we delivered record quarterly non-GAAP EBT and EBT margin results. Non-GAAP EBT was $477.1 million or 16.35% of net sales, and it increased $684.8 million or approximately 3,200 basis points from the same period last year. More relevantly, compared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $396 million or approximately 1,200 basis points as a percent of net sales.  \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79. This is compared to a net loss per share of $1.71 last year and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 in 2019, a 511% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.41. This includes $7.3 million in noncash interest expense as well as 9.2 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedged at settlement but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation. Both are related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter of 2020. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.  \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We're in a strong financial position, ending Q1 with approximately $1.86 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility. While our quarter-end inventory levels decreased 4% compared to the same period last year, our strong flow of products supported Q1 sales growth in excess of our expectations. Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean and we continue to expect a robust product flow.  \n In terms of supply chain expense, we are seeing elevated costs, which we expect to continue but thus far have mitigated this pressure through higher ticket as a result of being less promotional and increasing prices in select categories.  \n Turning to our first quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $57.2 million, and we paid $33 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased just over 1 million shares of our stock for $76.8 million at an average price of $74.59. And we have approximately $954 million remaining under our share repurchase program, and our plan for 2021 continues to include a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases.  \n Now let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings. As a result of our significant Q1 results, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance and now expect full year comp sales to increase by 8% to 11% compared to our prior expectation of down 2% to up 2%. At the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 22% sales increase versus 2019 compared to our prior expectation above 11%.  \n While we have been very pleased with the start of our second quarter and are highly encouraged about the rest of the year, beginning in June, we will start to anniversary significant comp sales gains from last year. There's also continued uncertainty around when consumer behavior will normalize and what the new normal will be. And we are limited in our ability to forecast demand, particularly as it relates to the second half.  \n Given this, within our updated outlook, we have maintained our Q3 and Q4 performance expectations in line with our original guidance, which assumes comps will decline in the range of high single to low double digits. Non-GAAP EBT is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion compared to our prior outlook of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 142% versus 2019 and up 45% versus 2020. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10%.  \n Within this, gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019, driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins. When compared to 2020, gross margin is also expected to increase, driven by leverage on fixed expenses, while merchandise margins are expected to be approximately flat. This assumes a gradual normalization of promotions beginning in the second quarter and modest deleverage on fixed expenses in the second half. \n SG&A expense is expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020 due to the significant projected increase in full year sales. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2021, we transitioned last year's premium pay program to a more lasting compensation program, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums. The impact of these programs has been included within our guidance. \n In total, we are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $8 to $8.70 compared to our prior outlook of $4.40 to $5.20. At the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated EPS guidance is up 126% versus 2019 and up 36% versus 2020. Our updated earnings guidance is based on 97 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q1 results and remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: I'm sorry, I'm still too speechless to say congratulations. I wanted to -- I think -- I guess, Lauren, I'm going to ask you. On the curbside customers, can you remind us what the spend is on them? Is there like a calculation whereas you're building more curbside customers? Do they spend 2x or 3x normal customers and do they spend that within the stores, not in the stores? \n And maybe also with, I guess, it's 10.5 million new customers, you said they're younger and they're more female. Could you talk about how they're spending with you and can you give us any kind of numbers? Do they spend more than historical customers? Are you losing some customers as you bring on all these new customers? Sort of more help on what -- who's actually coming into the store and how they're spending. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Robby. So in terms of curbside customers, I mean, our best customer is our omnichannel customer, someone who shops in all channels. And this curbside is so new, we don't have specific data on those specific customers versus the general eCommerce customers. But overall, when somebody comes into our system and if they shop in a store and they shop online, they are a more valuable customer. \n In terms of new customers, so you're right, we had 8.5 million last year and 2 million new customers this year. Our database continues to grow. We have over 30 million e-mails that we can reach out to people with and communicate to and personalize our offers to them and our communication to them. And those athletes are spending more than last year and doing well versus existing customers. We're not going to share specifically how they're doing but we are very pleased with their retention rate. They're shopping again. They're shopping again within a short window, a few week window, and we're very pleased with that. \nRobert Ohmes: Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. Lee, on the guidance, I just want to clarify. What kind of promotional environment are you guys expecting, kind of a return to full normal in the back half of this year? Or how should we think about the promotional environment? \nLee Belitsky: We're not anticipating a return to full normal that we might have seen in 2018 and 2019, but we are anticipating a gradual return of promotions kind of beginning here later in Q2 and then building throughout the back half of the year. \nRobert Ohmes: Got it. Congratulations. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Just when we thought it couldn't get better, it does. So congrats. Lauren, so my first question for you. For those -- and we've talked about this. For those who were strengthened during the pandemic, you're in a very unique position of being able to accelerate investment, test some new formats, take a little bit more risk than maybe some others. And so we're seeing you do that with House of Sport. \n But you're also doing a variety of other things, exclusive high-touch in-store soccer shops and then also lower -- going lower with OVERTIME, Warehouse and off-price concepts. I know they're very small and still in test format, but what are you learning about each, particularly at the lower end, OVERTIME, Warehouse and the Going, Going, Gone! Are you just testing those to see which format will win out? And then any ideas on kind of the thoughts there, the strategy? \nLauren Hobart: Okay. Thanks, Adrienne. So in terms of -- you're right, we're investing in our business in many, many different ways. But the one thing, I think, is important to realize is that many of these initiatives were in place before the pandemic and are just continuing on now. So that would be including our Golf Galaxy investments, our House of Sport, all -- a lot of things -- our soccer shops, a lot of things were in the works and just basically paused during the pandemic. \n We come out of the pandemic now with a lot of consumer demand and tailwinds and the strategies that we knew made sense before the pandemic, we are even more eager and more excited to get going on them. So we're definitely investing in the business. We're investing in our omnichannel experience. We're investing in experiential aspects of the store you see with House of Sport and things like rock climbing walls and the soccer shops and footwear decks and HitTrax, everywhere where we can add experience, we're doing that. \n Specific to Warehouse and Going, Going Gone!, that is truly just a test. We're using it as a clearance vehicle in the DICK'S channel, and we will have more to come on that, but it's just -- it's a handful of stores right now and it is a test just in order to keep our clearance moving. I hope I answered all of your questions. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. Super helpful. And then Lee -- yes, you did. Lee, a quick one for you. What percent, if you're willing to share that with us, what percent of Team Sports and associated accessories sort of on an annualized basis, and I'm sure that, that bumps up in the back-to-school season, so if you can give us kind of penetration in the third quarter? And then lastly, $2 billion, close to $2 billion of cash. What are your thoughts on what to do with all that money? \nLee Belitsky: Well, a couple of things. Team Sports has its highest penetration in the business typically in the first quarter. And then that's followed by the third quarter as the second highest penetration and then the second and the fourth. Fourth quarter is the lowest penetration. So we did really well with Team Sports in the first quarter, and that's in its highest penetration quarter. So we're excited about it. We were well inventoried coming into the quarter, expecting a resurgence, and we were able to meet that demand. \n With respect to the cash that we have on the balance sheet right now, overall, we intend to continue to be conservative on maintaining cash balances. However, we're able to support the investments in new concepts that we have going forward. We're able to invest in working capital. We haven't rebuilt our inventories yet but we are continuing to be fairly aggressive on our inventory buys for the back half of the year. So even though in our guidance, we have anticipated sales down 10%, approximately 10% to last year, up 10% to 2019, we are going to be buying to support continued comp sales gains as -- because we don't want to kind of lead the consumer there, and we want to let our customer tell us when they're ready to slow down. So we're going to have the inventory and we have the working capital, and we have the cash to go do that and make those bets. \n Ed had talked earlier, and as had Lauren, that we're going to continue to invest in our stores and new concepts. We are maintaining our guidance on buying back $200 million of -- at least $200 million of stock this year. And we expect to continue to make our dividend payments as we've increased those over the last several years. So we have a lot of uses for it. But having said that, we anticipate continuing to be conservatively capitalized and maintaining a sizable cash balance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Nice results. My first question is on gross margin and I wanted to focus on 2 elements of it. First, if you can look at product margins and look at it within category, are there any changes that are improving that you could sort of attribute structurally getting better, whether the hardline margin is getting better within itself because of mix or apparel and footwear? And then the other part of it is, if you look at the eCommerce business, and I realize you look at it all combined multichannel, but any way to quantify how much better EBIT margins can be structurally from higher BOPIS or from ship-from-store than pre-COVID? \nLauren Hobart: So I'll start with the last question. So with eCommerce, it's certainly advantageous for us to have a higher penetration of BOPIS and curbside. We're up 500% versus 2019 on those areas. The channel is benefiting from that but also benefiting by the fact that we invested in technology many years ago, and we've created a platform now where we do get leverage as the sales come in and then our gross margin, again to your second question, which has been extremely strong for the last few quarters and including this past quarter.\n Within categories for gross margin, we are finding, across the board, we are not in a promotional environment nor are we certainly leading in any promotional way. And so across the board, the categories have been improving in gross margin. It's true of hardlines, it's true of footwear, it's true of apparel. So overall, it's a really, really good story, and we're very, very pleased with eCommerce profitability. The more BOPIS and curbside, the better, but even the ship-from-home business, everything is more profitable now as we scale. \nLee Belitsky: And I would just add to that, due to the strength of demand kind of across our product assortment, we're not really creating much in the way of clearance merchandise. So we don't have a little bit of an anchor on our merchandise margin rates coming from dealing with clearance that we would typically have. And the clearance stores that we've opened have also helped us to more efficiently deal with our clearance inventory. So structurally, that's helped us with our merchandise margin rates, but the strong demand has helped us as well. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up maybe for Ed and for Lauren. I know you're trying to be prudent about what we extrapolate for the future, given how strong things are right now. Maybe can we talk about certain things that you think may continue, whether it's the category stays stronger? And then things that you've changed, whether it's product assortment or your platform? And I don't know if you throw around, at this stage, sort of comping the comp again, right, but this business is, I think, did double digit last year. Now it should -- looks like it's on track to do double digit again. Is that even a scenario that -- you've been joking around with? I know it's early but curious how you think about what's sustainable here. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So there -- look, we're learning everyday, as is everybody, in terms of what the new consumer's going to be and what the new consumer behavior is going to be. There's a lot of factors going on right now, including, as Lee said, stimulus and a whole bunch of other things. But there -- but what we've seen for sure is that Team Sports came back with a vengeance, rightly so, because it had been a year or so since people have played or more. \n And at the same time, some of the \"surging categories\" that were \"pandemic-related\" such as golf and fitness, outdoor, are still really, really, really strong. So can we predict the future? We can't. We were sort of joking that you guys were going to ask about if we can comp the comp, but we feel really, really positive about the business and what we're seeing about consumer demand as we head into the future. \nEdward Stack: I think a couple of things that have changed that we've done has been -- our team has done a great job with differentiating product that we have in the store versus our direct competitors or even some tangential competitors by differentiating product not only from the key brands that we have. If you take a look at our footwear assortment and what we've done with the premium full-service footwear areas or what we've done with our concept shops from Nike and a few other brands and along with what we've done with our vertical brands, the team has so differentiated the product out there that we're really a different retailer than our competitors. \n And I think that's -- the consumer is realizing that, shopping us more and gives us the opportunity from a margin rate standpoint to not be in that promotional environment. And I think we'll be less promotional. When and if a promotional environment comes back, I think we'll be in less of a promotional aspect of -- from our company because of the differentiated product. And I can't say enough about how this merchandising team, the store team, the marketing team has developed this and one of the real reasons for our success right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could give some of the comp metrics, traffic ticket versus 2019, particularly at the store level. But also would be curious to hear about categories versus 1Q '19, just which ones have really taken a large amount of share within the box and online versus those that are down. Obviously, hunt would be, I think, the obvious one there, but curious if any others are lower. And then just second, on the Team Sports strength that you saw in the spring, how much of that was driven by spring team sports versus fall sports that just got pushed out of the spring? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So our traffic and ticket versus 2019 are both positive, and we're feeling really good about that. Obviously, when you look versus 2020, the traffic numbers are a little distorted due to the fact that -- I mean we're up significantly, our stores were closed. But even during versus '19, where we have strong double-digit growth in both of those. With regard to team sports, it's an interesting thing, what's happening with team sports. There's certainly a lot of pent-up demand, and then there's also strange phenomenons like there was a mini-football season this January, February that you wouldn't have thought would have happened. And so it's definitely -- there's been excessive amounts of team sport demand in Q1. But I don't think that, that's -- and that's -- I mean, I'm guessing, but I don't think it's a pull forward of fall sports. I think there's still a tremendous number of athletes who are going to take the field who are not equipped yet and football come back in mass, and kids are still growing. So we feel good about the future of team sports. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And just on the supply chain side, any categories that you're still finding it hard to chase? \nLauren Hobart: So I think this is an important point, but our supply chain group has done an absolutely outstanding job managing through 15 months of real challenges from a supply chain standpoint. And that's been -- originally, it was in the hard goods and fitness, and we talked about that. But we -- it's hit almost every aspect of the business, so we're chasing all the time. We're chasing everything. But we've gotten really good at it. And we have attack teams on it day in and day out. We're working with our vendors. We're picking up product wherever it is and helping get it into our supply chain sooner. And so I think this has actually become a core capability of ours that we can drive growth with a challenged and challenging supply chain. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So you're pointing to a 10% operating margin this year. Your prior peak has been a 9% operating margin. Is it 10% margin the right way that we should be modeling the business moving forward? \nLee Belitsky: Michael, we're going to have to see how the back half of the year settles out this year. I think there's still quite a few unknowns about what the new level of demand is that's out there within our product categories. We know it's going to be -- we're very confident it's going to be significantly higher than 2019, and we become meaningfully more optimistic about that as we get longer and longer into this run we're making right now. But we certainly feel better about higher levels of operating margin than we did 3 months ago, 6 months ago. But I don't think we're ready to guide on what the long-term margin outlook is yet until we see kind of a normalization of spending on travel, on restaurants and how that affects our categories. But certainly, the consumer is saying they want to continue to be outside, trying to -- continue to try to get fit, buying athletic apparel, athletic footwear, playing golf. And I think a lot of those trends are going to stay with us for some time, but we've got to let this play out a little bit before we can get the long-term view. \nMichael Lasser: And Lee, as part of that, can you frame when you had a 9% operating margin back in 2012, you had a 31.5% gross margin. eCommerce penetration was much lower than. How does your merch margin today compare to where it was back then? And as an unrelated point to that, you had mentioned that you were very pleased with the start of the quarter. What does that put the bias to the upside, too, for your full year guidance, if the strength you're seeing now continues? \nLee Belitsky: The merchandise margin rates are running higher now than they were at peak because -- simply because we just don't have any promotions right now, and we have very little clearance merchandise to work with, and we've never really been in a position where we haven't had to run promotions. Now that's going to be -- as we go forward, it's going to be a matter of when the promotions return at what level. We're encouraged by some of the activities of some of our brands. We have been narrowing distribution of product and have been narrowing it basically away from some of the players that have typically led promotions in the past. So we're excited about that and what the outlook could be around promotions there. We're encouraged by the restraint there's been on putting product into the various channels as well. So product continues to be -- product levels continue to be pretty thin, which suggests a continuing of favorable margins. So the merch margin, as we look out, should continue to be favorable, but right now, we're running meaningfully higher than we were at peak. \n The start of the quarter, how does it impact fiscal year guidance? We baked some of the beat from Q2 into the guidance. We -- the guidance rolls in our first quarter beat versus what our expectations were and a little bit from Q2. At the low end, it's got a small beat from Q2. At the higher end, it's got a little bit of a bigger beat from Q2, but we are flowing through some increases from the second quarter as well. \nMichael Lasser: That is very helpful. Good luck with the rest of the spring. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. A couple of follow-ups here. Just we know the first quarter. You said the third and fourth quarter down about 10%. You can get a pretty big range for the second quarter anywhere from -- looking at my math, down high single digits to up low single digits. Can you sort of -- why not just tell us what you think the second quarter will be since you already -- what the guidance is in the second quarter since you already gave us the back half, just to make sure everyone's on the same page? \nLee Belitsky: We're not going to give the specific numbers around the second quarter. However, we're very pleased with the start. And really in June, we start to come up against these significant double-digit comp sales gains and coming to Father's Day and beginning of back-to-school. So we're going to have to let it play out here as we start to come up against the big gains that we saw in the kind of the back half here of the second quarter. \nMichael Baker: Okay, okay. Fair enough. I also wanted to follow up on Mike Lasser's question just about where you are now versus your prior peak. It seems to be that your vendor relationships have improved quite a bit. Just on my math, you're a -- Nike is actually a smaller percent of your business than it was. And you're a bigger percent of Nike's North American business, if you will. I think Under Armour is cutting back on some of their vendors. Can you just give -- bigger picture, maybe this is a question for Ed, just describe how and why your vendor relationships have changed over the past 8 years or 9 years since the past peak? \nEdward Stack: Well, I think our vendor relationships are better than they were back then, but they weren't bad back then either. And I think that some of the key people that we partner with have seen the commitment we've gotten to from a service standpoint, a commitment we've gotten to the  environment and the experience when an athlete comes into our store, and they've liked that. We've worked with them with that. They've given us additional allocation of product, which we've done a great job. Our teams have done a great job of merchandising, marketing, selling. \n And I think it's -- we really look at the key partners that I mentioned truly as partners. And I think partnership can be an overused word but we really do partner with them. They partner with us. We understand what their objectives are. They understand what our objectives are. We sit down. We have a conversation. We come to marketplace that's good for both of us. And I think that will continue to move forward. And our relationships with the brands, I think, will only continue to get better. And I think that's good for us and I think it's good for our brands, too. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Yes, makes sense. I'll just end by saying I'm not looking forward to buying my second pair of football cleats for my son in 5 months. But I guess bad for me, good for you. \nLauren Hobart: His feet are growing. \nEdward Stack: Well, I hope that everybody feels the same way you do. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Yes. Let me extend my congratulations on just phenomenal performance and just such a differentiated offering versus all your competitors out there. Lee, could you give us any detail on how you're thinking about transactions and tickets for the remainder of the year? I feel like there's still tailwinds behind ticket. Obviously, transactions was going to be huge in Q1, but I'm curious in terms of how we should think about transactions ticket in the overall comp guidance for the remainder of the year. \nLee Belitsky: Well, I think generally, there are more tailwinds behind the ticket side in the transaction to what will remain to be played out here. But as we continue to be not very promotional and not getting back to normal kind of levels of promotion really this year, that bodes well for ticket. Also, we've seen trading up in some areas as well, particularly like in golf where there's a better inventory supply of new products than there is in cascaded prior year products. The consumers showed a willingness to trade up and we expect that trend to continue. \n So I think that there's pretty good tailwinds around ticket around promotions, lack of clearance, trading up a bit to some better products. So we feel good about that. Transactions, we're going to have to let that play out and see when as folks get back to kind of normalized activities and travel and so on. But we continue to get the trips, the high level of trips that we're getting now into our stores. Our comp sales in stores have been fantastic and we'll continue to get the traffic online as well. But I'd tell you, the outlook for ticket is good. The outlook for traffic may be good but we're not that certain around it. \nJohn Kernan: Understood. Maybe just a quick follow-up on private label. The performance in Q1, I think it was annualizing around $1.3 billion last year, just the margin profile of that business, the top line performance in Q1. And then any initial reads on VRST? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. The vertical brands performed fantastically in Q1, in line with the entire chain, and margin did expand somewhat, so really great trends on vertical brands. And did you say about VRST, was that your last question? \nJohn Kernan: Yes. \nLauren Hobart: Yes, we're very pleased with VRST and how we've launched and the fact that it is a true white space in our stores. It's not -- it's an opportunity to get the athletic male in a lifestyle capacity in a way that we weren't serving before. So I would say everybody on the call should go try it. It's amazing. It's a really high-quality fashion-forward product and we're excited about it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: Great quarter. I just want to follow up on Adrienne's question about some of the new banners that you're piloting. Can we see square footage, the square footage component of the algorithm start to pick up in the near term? And also, can you just talk a little bit about how the OVERTIME and Going, Going, Gone! concepts are tying into the inventory clearance? What products go through these channels? Are they moving the needle on gross margin? \nLauren Hobart: So first question on the square footage, we do have some net growth in stores coming in the next few years. In the long term, our strategy is not to significantly expand our square footage but possibly that we will show up differently within the square footage we have. But we are building new concepts, there will be some net square footage growth. Lee, I'll turn it to you for the Going, Going, Gone! and clearance question. \nLee Belitsky: I mean, Going, Going, Gone! and clearance, we have a couple of different concepts within here. But at this point, they're handling clearance product coming from DICK'S stores. The DICK'S stores have been generating less clearance but we certainly have enough to give us a good test in these stores. It is moving the gross margin needle, the gross margins. The merchandise margins that we're getting out of these stores are considerably higher than when we handle clearance merchandise within the DICK'S stores. So we're really pleased with that. \n And it's still a test for us. We're going to read it for a while and make a determination. But so far, the signs are good that at a minimum, it's helping us with clearance in the DICK'S stores and maybe there's an opportunity to make some money at it over the long term. But we're going to test it and see how it works for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So following on the sort of use of cash opportunity that you have ahead, are there -- as you continue to focus on experiences and getting better at eCommerce, are there certain capabilities that you think would be useful in terms of using some of that cash deployment and acquiring that and bringing those capabilities in-house? \nLauren Hobart: So we always are looking to improve our core capabilities, and a lot of our investments in capital this year is exactly that, improving our capabilities. We look opportunistically at M&A as well, if that's what you're getting at. But right now, we're very focused on building capabilities internally. \nLee Belitsky: Right. And I'll just say that we've got a really, really good relationship, at this point, with Federal Express and meet with them regularly as they talk about different ways to get product to our athletes more quickly. So while we do look at opportunities to bring capabilities in-house, we're really pleased with the partnership we've got with the team at FedEx. And they've been extremely helpful in coming up with new ideas as well. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. That's very helpful. And then looking at the merchandise margin improvement, in 1Q relative to 4Q, it did tick down a little bit, obviously, relative to 2019, that is. Obviously, very strong numbers on a 2-year basis. So was that just we have more winter clearance, more clearance activity in the fourth quarter around winter and that's the delta on a 2-year basis versus not -- 1Q is not as big of a clearance quarter? \nLauren Hobart: Lee, you want to take that? \nLee Belitsky: Yes. I mean, it does come down to mix and there was more clearance in the fourth quarter of 2019 than -- and first quarter is not a big clearance quarter for us. So you're on it, Chris. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: And again, congratulations on the quarter. So one of my questions, with regard to back-to-school and that period, are you guys changing your approach this year? I mean, presumably, it's coming at a time when the child tax credit's coming through and that should help families. And I would think you guys should be able to capitalize on that. So I was wondering if you're thinking about it differently than you have in years past. \nLauren Hobart: Back-to-school, we think, is going to be big. A lot of opportunity to meet both the field and in the classroom for athletic apparel and footwear, so we're leaning into it. We have a great marketing campaign plan. We've got great products coming in and we're expecting it to be a strong season. \nLee Belitsky: And call it, last year, back-to-school, I'd say was smaller than typical because a lot of kids didn't go back to school and it came later because many of the schools were delayed for several weeks before they got going. So there's a big opportunity between the child tax credit that's coming and the smaller and delayed back-to-school to get the third quarter off to a good start. \nJoseph Feldman: That's great. And if I could follow up one more on -- with regard to labor, we keep hearing so much about it's been difficult to find labor out there. And also, we know of wage pressure, but then -- and I know you guys talked about that. But can you maybe share some thoughts on how you're -- if you're able to get labor as easily as you have in the past, and what kind of wage pressure you are thinking about for this year? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So it's a good question and it's something obviously that we and everybody else is focused on. We've gotten ahead of it in a number of different ways in that we are -- we were out trying to build to peak volumes and hire people in advance. But I do think one thing that's really important to note is that our teammates, between our policies and how we've shared some of the upside in our earnings over the last year and also how we treated people during the pandemic and tried to bring them back as quickly as possible and kept people's health insurance paid, we really put our team first. \n Personally, I can say, the company felt like a family in every single way during that time and it was really a joy to see. And I actually do think that, that's helping us from a retention standpoint. I think in general, we are an employer of choice right now. And so we certainly are struggling -- a few markets we're struggling but it's not a top-of-mind challenge. \nJoseph Feldman: That's helpful. And good luck with this quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: So you guys are obviously making a lot of changes to the business. You talked about the golf, the soccer shops and new store formats. And you've also talked about how you're happy with the early results. But honestly, it seems like everything is really strong right now. So do you think you're in a position where you can really evaluate these initiatives properly and whether they're going to generate the kind of returns you guys are looking for in a more normal environment? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, obviously, you're right. Every category is trending right now or most of them are. So obviously, things are doing much better than we might have expected. But when we built these initiatives out, we didn't expect comps quite like this or sales quite like this. We have a productive business model and we're learning from these concepts every day in terms of what can be translated back into the DICK'S store, both in golf and with the House of Sports and all these experiential concepts. So I think we can tell and we look versus balance of chain, how things are doing, we can tell what's working and what's not. \nEdward Stack: And these are not concepts or programs that we've put in place recently or thought about recently. As I said, these have been a couple of years in the gestation period, and we're pretty confident that these are going to work. Whether it's the soccer shop, we had done a couple of soccer shops last year and have, right in the middle of the pandemic, and knew that soccer was an area that we weren't great in. If you take a look at how we are in baseball and football, soccer was an area that we trailed in. \n So we're just making some of these investments in these areas to bring us up to parity with some other categories that we are -- we are more top of mind with. So these have all been very thoughtful, and I suspect there might be a surprise or 2 here but we're pretty confident with these. And the House of Sport that we opened up in Rochester is off to a great start. The other House of Sport that we've done in Knoxville is a very differentiated experience. And I think they were going to continue to be very viable as we go forward. \nScot Ciccarelli: That's all really helpful. And then kind of related to that, I'm assuming a lot of these changes does increase your cost of doing business or the comp breakeven level. So is that something we should kind of think about when we think -- if we assume that we'll go back to a more historical comp pattern at some point? \nEdward Stack: We think that these areas have a big growth opportunity even when we go back to something that would be normal, whatever the new normal might be. But these are categories that we felt that we were deficient in or had a great opportunity in prior to the pandemic. And the pandemic put them on hold, and we've had the opportunity to continue to refine and test them during this period. \n So whether it's access to product, and when you take a look at the soccer shops that we've done, we have access to shoes at price points that we didn't have access to before or decided not to put in. And when we've tested these, that athlete who's the more enthusiast athlete, has really responded no differently than what we did with baseball prior to the pandemic when we reengineered our baseball department and really tried to cater to that enthusiast baseball player, which did great. We've got the same thing that is going to happen -- is happening in soccer, and we've got a couple of other opportunities that we'll be looking at later this year and into next year that we think we can do the same thing with. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just this one quick one for me. When you look at sales performance in the quarter and maybe into the month of May by region, particularly in states that are farther along in the reopening process, I'm curious what you're seeing from a trip frequency and overall buying perspective. \nLee Belitsky: I mean, we're seeing strength across the country right now. Probably seeing a little bit more strength in the states that were closed for longer like in the Northeast and California. But nationwide, we're seeing strength. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. \nSteven Forbes: Congrats as well. Maybe just to follow up on loyalty and customer trends, right? If I look for the presentation here, you did note that 70%, right, of the 8.5 million new athletes were acquired during the -- through the digital channel in 2020. So curious if you can sort of discuss how that cohort is engaging with the brand in '21 thus far in terms of channel and whether the repeat or retention behavior has historically differed between those acquired through digital versus brick-and-mortar? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, it's a great question. What we're finding is that generally speaking, people's first transaction once acquired is in the same channel that they came in through. And we have so many new users in the digital channel that I don't think looking backwards to say how that's going to change is going to be very helpful. So retention is good. It's good across all of whichever way they're coming in, and they're repeating more often than not in the channel where they came in. \nSteven Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up. I'm not sure if the number was disclosed before, right, but you called out the -- in the presentation, I think it's the 4 million ScoreCard Gold, right -- sorry, 5 million ScoreCard Gold loyalty members, $500 or more. So 2 questions on that. One, what was that up versus 2019 or any sort of commentary on growth right in that -- in the Gold member base? And then also any comment on just the breadth of category participation, right, among that group, right? How broad is their purchasing behavior in terms of the categories in which you serve? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. The ScoreCard Gold program, actually, one of the reasons why I think you're noticing it for the first time is this isn't -- it's only a year or 2 old, like we don't have a comp versus 2019. We've started -- I want to say it was 18 months ago or so that we started the program, and it's obviously our best customers. You have to spend $500 to get into the program or be a credit card member, and they definitely buy a broad range of products. So they are the best of the best. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congratulations. My question is around fiscal stimulus. I know it's tough to quantify, but do you have a sense how much this stimulus might have driven your sales growth versus 2019 in the first quarter? \nLee Belitsky: Yes. We certainly believe that it helped the business but I wouldn't want to put a number on it. The business was in good shape going into the stimulus. We did get a nice lift when those checks started hitting. But the business has continued to be strong throughout the first quarter and going into the second quarter as well. So... \nSeth Basham: If we looked at the slowdown implied in your guidance for the second quarter from the first quarter in terms of growth versus 2019, would you say that the biggest driver of that slowdown is fading fiscal stimulus benefits? \nLee Belitsky: I wouldn't say that. \nSeth Basham: What would it be then, if you could give us some recap? \nLee Belitsky: So I would say that versus '19, I think our biggest concern is when people start traveling over the summer and they're booking vacations and spending in restaurants and going to concerts and things like that, where is the share going to be? And I think that's more of our concern than stimulus because there is actually some new stimulus coming beginning in July with the child tax credit that is going to start to be distributed on a monthly basis. \nEdward Stack: Seth, did you have another question or do we want to go on to the next question? Next question, Sarah. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: I actually want to add my congratulations on a great start to the year. And we're getting towards the end, so I'm going to ask just one question. It's a bit of a follow-up. But clearly, we've talked about -- you mentioned the forthcoming more difficult comparisons. And it is telegraphed in your guidance, you're smarter and conservatively assuming a moderation in sales trends through the back half of this year. So the question I have is, are you -- as you think about this, are you prepared to sort of say just let the business run against these comparisons as well? Or are there levers at your disposal that you could potentially pull to help cushion impact these comparisons? \nLauren Hobart: Go ahead. Yes. Sorry, I've got it. So yes, there are multiple levers we could pull if we wanted to and we'll have to assess it. I mean, as we've mentioned, we're not promotional right now. Could we pull that lever? Yes. Do we want to? No. So we're going to watch it. We're really monitoring the business versus 2019 trends and trying not to get caught up in the ups and downs of each of these quarters or do anything irrational as a result of what might be uncomfortable for short term. So yes, we have levers but we are planning to continue with the business as it is. \nBrian Nagel: Great. Then maybe just one quick follow-up from a bigger picture standpoint. Clearly, the business performed extraordinarily well here as the economy is reopening. Are you seeing indications that through the COVID crisis, there was some competitive fallout within the sporting goods category? You know potentially making it an easier competitive backdrop for DICK'S now? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I mean, there's been obviously some other channels, nonsporting goods. Some competitors have gone out of business and some of the department stores have stopped selling some products. But generally speaking, no. We are the leader in the sporting goods category and remain that way. \nBrian Nagel: I appreciate it. Congrats again. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining our Q1 call, and we will see you next quarter. Have a great spring. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Edward Stack",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased to announce yet another quarter of record results as we continue to execute at a very high level and capitalize on incredibly strong consumer demand. We're in a great lane right now, and 2021 will be our boldest and most transformational year in the company's history. We believe the future of retail is experiential, powered by technology and a world-class omnichannel operating model. \n Importantly, we are reimagining the athlete experience both across our core business and through new concepts that we have been working on for the past several years, which will collectively propel our growth in the future. We recently debuted DICK'S House of Sport in Rochester, New York. It's off to a great start and is on track to become among our highest-volume stores in the chain. We have reimagined virtually everything in the store and believe it sets the standard for sport retailing and athlete engagement. Our partners who have visited the store all agree there's nothing like it, and we hope everyone has the opportunity to see it in person. \n Next, we are completely reengineering our Golf Galaxy business. The game of golf is in great shape and our golf business has been tremendous. With Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters, we're leaning into this streak by investing in our Golf Galaxy business and adding TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience. We are also investing in talent to elevate the in-store service model and are remodeling 18 stores this year. The new stores we've remodeled are showing promising results. Looking ahead, we expect golf to have a long runway, and we are committed to leveraging this momentum for future growth within our business. \n Additionally, we are launching Public Lands, a complete outdoor omnichannel retail concept that will focus on making the outdoor as a place where everyone feels welcome and inspired. We've been working on Public Lands for several years and look forward to opening our first 2 stores later this year. Based on our research, we think there is an opportunity in the marketplace and believe this new concept will be a great growth vehicle for us. \n Importantly, conservation will play a prominent role in our new Public Lands concept, and we will champion environmental issues as we speak up to protect the planet and our public lands. As a member of the outdoor industry, we have also joined forces with other retailers to advocate for conserving 30% of the U.S. lands and waters by 2030. We expect to have the same voice and as much impact on these issues as we've had inside the DICK'S business, highlighting the youth sports crisis and sensible gun legislation. We'll be sharing more details about our plans for Public Lands in the weeks and months ahead. \n In closing, you can see DICK'S is a growth company, and we will continue to invest in our business to grow our lead as the nation's largest sport retailer. We see significant growth opportunities within DICK'S and Golf Galaxy as well as with House of Sport and Public Lands. We will continue to invest in our vertical brands and with our key partners, including Nike, North Face, Callaway, TaylorMade and others to elevate the athlete experience across the stores and online.  \n This morning, as Lauren and Lee discuss the results of our strategic growth drivers in greater detail, I couldn't be more excited about our business and more proud of our team and their unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Lauren. I think a couple of things that have changed that we've done has been -- our team has done a great job with differentiating product that we have in the store versus our direct competitors or even some tangential competitors by differentiating product not only from the key brands that we have. If you take a look at our footwear assortment and what we've done with the premium full-service footwear areas or what we've done with our concept shops from Nike and a few other brands and along with what we've done with our vertical brands, the team has so differentiated the product out there that we're really a different retailer than our competitors. \n And I think that's -- the consumer is realizing that, shopping us more and gives us the opportunity from a margin rate standpoint to not be in that promotional environment. And I think we'll be less promotional. When and if a promotional environment comes back, I think we'll be in less of a promotional aspect of -- from our company because of the differentiated product. And I can't say enough about how this merchandising team, the store team, the marketing team has developed this and one of the real reasons for our success right now. Well, I think our vendor relationships are better than they were back then, but they weren't bad back then either. And I think that some of the key people that we partner with have seen the commitment we've gotten to from a service standpoint, a commitment we've gotten to the  environment and the experience when an athlete comes into our store, and they've liked that. We've worked with them with that. They've given us additional allocation of product, which we've done a great job. Our teams have done a great job of merchandising, marketing, selling. \n And I think it's -- we really look at the key partners that I mentioned truly as partners. And I think partnership can be an overused word but we really do partner with them. They partner with us. We understand what their objectives are. They understand what our objectives are. We sit down. We have a conversation. We come to marketplace that's good for both of us. And I think that will continue to move forward. And our relationships with the brands, I think, will only continue to get better. And I think that's good for us and I think it's good for our brands, too. Well, I hope that everybody feels the same way you do. And these are not concepts or programs that we've put in place recently or thought about recently. As I said, these have been a couple of years in the gestation period, and we're pretty confident that these are going to work. Whether it's the soccer shop, we had done a couple of soccer shops last year and have, right in the middle of the pandemic, and knew that soccer was an area that we weren't great in. If you take a look at how we are in baseball and football, soccer was an area that we trailed in. \n So we're just making some of these investments in these areas to bring us up to parity with some other categories that we are -- we are more top of mind with. So these have all been very thoughtful, and I suspect there might be a surprise or 2 here but we're pretty confident with these. And the House of Sport that we opened up in Rochester is off to a great start. The other House of Sport that we've done in Knoxville is a very differentiated experience. And I think they were going to continue to be very viable as we go forward. We think that these areas have a big growth opportunity even when we go back to something that would be normal, whatever the new normal might be. But these are categories that we felt that we were deficient in or had a great opportunity in prior to the pandemic. And the pandemic put them on hold, and we've had the opportunity to continue to refine and test them during this period. \n So whether it's access to product, and when you take a look at the soccer shops that we've done, we have access to shoes at price points that we didn't have access to before or decided not to put in. And when we've tested these, that athlete who's the more enthusiast athlete, has really responded no differently than what we did with baseball prior to the pandemic when we reengineered our baseball department and really tried to cater to that enthusiast baseball player, which did great. We've got the same thing that is going to happen -- is happening in soccer, and we've got a couple of other opportunities that we'll be looking at later this year and into next year that we think we can do the same thing with. Seth, did you have another question or do we want to go on to the next question? Next question, Sarah."

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, we delivered another exceptionally strong quarter, achieving record first quarter sales and our highest-ever quarterly earnings, both significantly exceeding our expectations. Our Q1 consolidated same-store sales increased 115% as we anniversaried the majority of our temporary store closures from last year. The strength of our diverse category portfolio, supply chain, technology capabilities and omnichannel execution helped us continue to capitalize on strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle.  \n We also saw a resurgence in our team sports business as kids began to get back out on the field after a year in which many youth sports activities were delayed or canceled. Our strong comps were supported by sales growth of over 100% within each of our 3 primary categories: the hardlines, apparel and footwear as well as increases in both average ticket and transactions. Like others, we also benefited from the recent stimulus checks. These results combined translate to a 52% sales increase when compared -- combined -- sorry, when compared to the first quarter of 2019.  \n From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores generated significant triple-digit comps and importantly delivered an approximate 40% sales increase when compared to 2019 with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14%, which was on top of our 110% online sales increase in the same period last year when the vast majority of our stores were closed for over 6 weeks. This represented nearly a 140% increase when compared to 2019.  \n Within eCommerce, in-store pickup and curbside continued to be a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering, increasing approximately 500% when compared to BOPIS sales during the first quarter of 2019. And as a percent of online sales, we saw sequential growth compared to the second half of last year. These same-day services, along with ship-from-store, are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omnichannel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment.  \n During Q1, our stores enabled approximately 90% of our total sales and fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales through either ship-from-store, in-store pickup or curbside. Throughout the quarter, we remained disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence as certain categories in the marketplace continued to be supply constrained. As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 787 basis points versus 2020 and 312 basis points versus 2019. This merchandise margin expansion, along with substantial leverage on fixed costs, drove a significant improvement in gross margin.  \n In total, our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 not only represented a 511% increase over Q1 2019 but eclipsed our full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.59. During the first quarter last year, we recorded a net loss per share of $1.71 as we temporarily closed our stores to promote the safety of our teammates, athletes and communities.  \n Looking ahead, we remain very enthusiastic about our business, and we're raising our full year sales and earnings guidance. Our financial outlook balances this enthusiasm with the uncertainties that still exist, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year. Lee will address our outlook in greater detail within his remarks.  \n Now let me provide a few updates on our strategic growth drivers. First, within merchandising, our well-defined brand strategy drives differentiation and exclusivity within our assortment as we leverage both our key national brand partnerships and our highly profitable and growing vertical brand portfolio. During the quarter, our vertical brands continued to be a significant source of strength, posting triple-digit comps, with merchandise margin rate expansion that outperformed the company average.  \n We saw sustained success in DSG, our largest vertical brand, as well as in CALIA, our second-largest women's athletic apparel brand. This year, we are investing to make our vertical brands even stronger through improved space in store and increased marketing. In March, we augmented our men's athletic apparel selection by launching VRST, our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male. The team has done a great job with VRST and is off to a really strong start.  \n Next, to increase engagement with our athletes, we're taking steps to dial up service in our stores and to make our stores more experiential. As Ed mentioned, we've been very pleased with the early results from our first DICK'S House of Sport and are excited for the grand opening of our second location in Knoxville next week. Virtually everything in House of Sport is new, from our engagement and service models to our merchandising standards, brands and concept shops, as well as an adjacent outdoor field to host sports events and promote product trial. These highly experiential stores are exploring the future of retail, and they provide us a great opportunity to test and learn. We'll continue to refine and grow the House of Sport concept while also rolling the most successful elements into our core DICK'S stores.  \n Beyond House of Sport, we continue to evolve the DICK'S athlete experience. During the quarter, we added more than 30 soccer shops that provide a high level of service from in-store soccer experts who are especially trained to help athletes find the equipment and cleats they need to excel at the game. The soccer shops also feature a variety of updated in-store elements, including an elevated cleat shop, an expanded selection of licensed jerseys and soccer trial cages in select locations. We've been pleased with the initial results and plan to add additional shops throughout the year.  \n As discussed on prior calls, footwear is a key pillar of our merchandising strategy. And during the quarter, we converted more than 40 additional stores to premium full-service footwear. Over 50 more stores will be converted by the end of the year, taking this experience to approximately 60% of the DICK'S chain.  \n Lastly, as the #1 premium golf retailer in the world, we are benefiting from renewed interest in the game. Participation rates are healthy and energy for the game of golf continues to increase, with women, juniors and young adults contributing to the game's growth. As a result of this robust demand, our golf business has been great at both DICK'S and Golf Galaxy, with Golf Galaxy comps significantly outperforming the company average in recent quarters.  \n In 2021, we're investing over $20 million to transform our Golf Galaxy stores via a combination of elevated experience, industry-leading technology and unmatched expertise through our certified PGA and LPGA professionals. As part of this, we rolled out TrackMan technology to over 80% of the chain to enhance the fitting and lesson experience. We've also completely redesigned nearly 20 stores.  \n In addition, we enabled online booking of lessons and club fittings and invested in talent and training to elevate our in-store service model. We supported these efforts through our first Golf Galaxy-specific brand campaign, Better Your Best, across TV, social and in-store.  \n Now moving to our omnichannel capabilities. We continue to drive significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel through fewer promotions, leverage of fixed costs and strong athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside. We're continuing to enhance the curbside experience with new features like proxy pickup as well as through improved inventory availability and reduced pickup wait time for athletes.  \n During Q1, over 90% of curbside orders were ready within 15 minutes and upon check-in at the store, 50% were delivered to the athlete's car in under 2.5 minutes. Looking ahead, we continue to expect curbside pickup will remain a meaningful piece of our omnichannel offering as our athletes turn to this service for speed and convenience.  \n Along with curbside, our ScoreCard Program continues to be a key to our omnichannel offering with more than 20 million active members who drive over 70% of our sales. We're using data science to drive more personalized marketing and engagement with our athletes, which is resulting in strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year. Speaking of new athletes, we acquired nearly 2 million new athletes this past quarter, and relative to our existing athletes, they continue to skew younger and more female, representing a great opportunity for future growth.  \n In closing, we are a growth company steeped in technology and omnichannel experience with a bold path forward. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we are enthusiastic about our business and confident that our investments will strengthen our leadership position within the marketplace. I had the pleasure of visiting many of our stores during this first quarter, and I would like to thank our teammates across the company for their continued hard work, collaborative spirit and passion for serving our athletes and supporting our business. I will now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. Yes. Thanks, Robby. So in terms of curbside customers, I mean, our best customer is our omnichannel customer, someone who shops in all channels. And this curbside is so new, we don't have specific data on those specific customers versus the general eCommerce customers. But overall, when somebody comes into our system and if they shop in a store and they shop online, they are a more valuable customer. \n In terms of new customers, so you're right, we had 8.5 million last year and 2 million new customers this year. Our database continues to grow. We have over 30 million e-mails that we can reach out to people with and communicate to and personalize our offers to them and our communication to them. And those athletes are spending more than last year and doing well versus existing customers. We're not going to share specifically how they're doing but we are very pleased with their retention rate. They're shopping again. They're shopping again within a short window, a few week window, and we're very pleased with that. Okay. Thanks, Adrienne. So in terms of -- you're right, we're investing in our business in many, many different ways. But the one thing, I think, is important to realize is that many of these initiatives were in place before the pandemic and are just continuing on now. So that would be including our Golf Galaxy investments, our House of Sport, all -- a lot of things -- our soccer shops, a lot of things were in the works and just basically paused during the pandemic. \n We come out of the pandemic now with a lot of consumer demand and tailwinds and the strategies that we knew made sense before the pandemic, we are even more eager and more excited to get going on them. So we're definitely investing in the business. We're investing in our omnichannel experience. We're investing in experiential aspects of the store you see with House of Sport and things like rock climbing walls and the soccer shops and footwear decks and HitTrax, everywhere where we can add experience, we're doing that. \n Specific to Warehouse and Going, Going Gone!, that is truly just a test. We're using it as a clearance vehicle in the DICK'S channel, and we will have more to come on that, but it's just -- it's a handful of stores right now and it is a test just in order to keep our clearance moving. I hope I answered all of your questions. So I'll start with the last question. So with eCommerce, it's certainly advantageous for us to have a higher penetration of BOPIS and curbside. We're up 500% versus 2019 on those areas. The channel is benefiting from that but also benefiting by the fact that we invested in technology many years ago, and we've created a platform now where we do get leverage as the sales come in and then our gross margin, again to your second question, which has been extremely strong for the last few quarters and including this past quarter.\n Within categories for gross margin, we are finding, across the board, we are not in a promotional environment nor are we certainly leading in any promotional way. And so across the board, the categories have been improving in gross margin. It's true of hardlines, it's true of footwear, it's true of apparel. So overall, it's a really, really good story, and we're very, very pleased with eCommerce profitability. The more BOPIS and curbside, the better, but even the ship-from-home business, everything is more profitable now as we scale. Yes. So there -- look, we're learning everyday, as is everybody, in terms of what the new consumer's going to be and what the new consumer behavior is going to be. There's a lot of factors going on right now, including, as Lee said, stimulus and a whole bunch of other things. But there -- but what we've seen for sure is that Team Sports came back with a vengeance, rightly so, because it had been a year or so since people have played or more. \n And at the same time, some of the \"surging categories\" that were \"pandemic-related\" such as golf and fitness, outdoor, are still really, really, really strong. So can we predict the future? We can't. We were sort of joking that you guys were going to ask about if we can comp the comp, but we feel really, really positive about the business and what we're seeing about consumer demand as we head into the future. Yes. So our traffic and ticket versus 2019 are both positive, and we're feeling really good about that. Obviously, when you look versus 2020, the traffic numbers are a little distorted due to the fact that -- I mean we're up significantly, our stores were closed. But even during versus '19, where we have strong double-digit growth in both of those. With regard to team sports, it's an interesting thing, what's happening with team sports. There's certainly a lot of pent-up demand, and then there's also strange phenomenons like there was a mini-football season this January, February that you wouldn't have thought would have happened. And so it's definitely -- there's been excessive amounts of team sport demand in Q1. But I don't think that, that's -- and that's -- I mean, I'm guessing, but I don't think it's a pull forward of fall sports. I think there's still a tremendous number of athletes who are going to take the field who are not equipped yet and football come back in mass, and kids are still growing. So we feel good about the future of team sports. So I think this is an important point, but our supply chain group has done an absolutely outstanding job managing through 15 months of real challenges from a supply chain standpoint. And that's been -- originally, it was in the hard goods and fitness, and we talked about that. But we -- it's hit almost every aspect of the business, so we're chasing all the time. We're chasing everything. But we've gotten really good at it. And we have attack teams on it day in and day out. We're working with our vendors. We're picking up product wherever it is and helping get it into our supply chain sooner. And so I think this has actually become a core capability of ours that we can drive growth with a challenged and challenging supply chain. His feet are growing. Yes. The vertical brands performed fantastically in Q1, in line with the entire chain, and margin did expand somewhat, so really great trends on vertical brands. And did you say about VRST, was that your last question? Yes, we're very pleased with VRST and how we've launched and the fact that it is a true white space in our stores. It's not -- it's an opportunity to get the athletic male in a lifestyle capacity in a way that we weren't serving before. So I would say everybody on the call should go try it. It's amazing. It's a really high-quality fashion-forward product and we're excited about it. So first question on the square footage, we do have some net growth in stores coming in the next few years. In the long term, our strategy is not to significantly expand our square footage but possibly that we will show up differently within the square footage we have. But we are building new concepts, there will be some net square footage growth. Lee, I'll turn it to you for the Going, Going, Gone! and clearance question. So we always are looking to improve our core capabilities, and a lot of our investments in capital this year is exactly that, improving our capabilities. We look opportunistically at M&A as well, if that's what you're getting at. But right now, we're very focused on building capabilities internally. Lee, you want to take that? Back-to-school, we think, is going to be big. A lot of opportunity to meet both the field and in the classroom for athletic apparel and footwear, so we're leaning into it. We have a great marketing campaign plan. We've got great products coming in and we're expecting it to be a strong season. Yes. So it's a good question and it's something obviously that we and everybody else is focused on. We've gotten ahead of it in a number of different ways in that we are -- we were out trying to build to peak volumes and hire people in advance. But I do think one thing that's really important to note is that our teammates, between our policies and how we've shared some of the upside in our earnings over the last year and also how we treated people during the pandemic and tried to bring them back as quickly as possible and kept people's health insurance paid, we really put our team first. \n Personally, I can say, the company felt like a family in every single way during that time and it was really a joy to see. And I actually do think that, that's helping us from a retention standpoint. I think in general, we are an employer of choice right now. And so we certainly are struggling -- a few markets we're struggling but it's not a top-of-mind challenge. Yes, it's a great question. I mean, obviously, you're right. Every category is trending right now or most of them are. So obviously, things are doing much better than we might have expected. But when we built these initiatives out, we didn't expect comps quite like this or sales quite like this. We have a productive business model and we're learning from these concepts every day in terms of what can be translated back into the DICK'S store, both in golf and with the House of Sports and all these experiential concepts. So I think we can tell and we look versus balance of chain, how things are doing, we can tell what's working and what's not. Yes, it's a great question. What we're finding is that generally speaking, people's first transaction once acquired is in the same channel that they came in through. And we have so many new users in the digital channel that I don't think looking backwards to say how that's going to change is going to be very helpful. So retention is good. It's good across all of whichever way they're coming in, and they're repeating more often than not in the channel where they came in. Yes. The ScoreCard Gold program, actually, one of the reasons why I think you're noticing it for the first time is this isn't -- it's only a year or 2 old, like we don't have a comp versus 2019. We've started -- I want to say it was 18 months ago or so that we started the program, and it's obviously our best customers. You have to spend $500 to get into the program or be a credit card member, and they definitely buy a broad range of products. So they are the best of the best. Go ahead. Yes. Sorry, I've got it. So yes, there are multiple levers we could pull if we wanted to and we'll have to assess it. I mean, as we've mentioned, we're not promotional right now. Could we pull that lever? Yes. Do we want to? No. So we're going to watch it. We're really monitoring the business versus 2019 trends and trying not to get caught up in the ups and downs of each of these quarters or do anything irrational as a result of what might be uncomfortable for short term. So yes, we have levers but we are planning to continue with the business as it is. Yes. I mean, there's been obviously some other channels, nonsporting goods. Some competitors have gone out of business and some of the department stores have stopped selling some products. But generally speaking, no. We are the leader in the sporting goods category and remain that way. Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining our Q1 call, and we will see you next quarter. Have a great spring."

            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales increased 119% to approximately $2.92 billion. Including the impact of last year's temporary store closures, consolidated same-store sales increased 115%. This increase was broad-based with each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear comping up over 100%. Transactions increased 90% and average ticket increased 25%. Compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 52%.  \n Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up nearly 190% as we anniversaried last year's temporary store closures, and compared to 2019, increased approximately 40% with roughly the same square footage. Our eCommerce sales increased 14% over last year and increased 139% versus 2019. As a percent of total net sales, our online business was 20%. As expected, this decreased from the 39% of net sales in 2020, given last year's temporary store closures, but increased compared to the 13% we had in 2019.  \n Lastly, in terms of stimulus, while this can be difficult to quantify, we recognize that our athletes had more cash to spend during the quarter and believe we benefited from this during the first quarter.  \n Gross profit in the first quarter was $1.09 billion or 37.3% of net sales and improved approximately 2,100 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of approximately 1,000 basis points from the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 787 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions and a favorable sales mix. Additionally, last year included $28 million of inventory write-downs resulting from our temporary store closures, which were subsequently recovered in the second quarter of 2020 due to better-than-anticipated sales and margin on merchandise nearing the end of life upon the reopening of our stores.  \n The balance of the improvement was driven by lower shipping expense as a percent of net sales due to higher brick-and-mortar store sales penetration following last year's temporary store closures. Compared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of sales improved by 795 basis points, driven by leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 475 basis points due to the significant sales increase and merchandise margin rate expansion of 312 basis points, primarily driven by fewer promotions.  \n SG&A expenses were $608.3 million or 20.84% of net sales and leveraged 940 basis points compared to last year due to significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $205.1 million, of which $21 million is attributable to the expense recognition associated with changes in our deferred compensation plan investment values. This expense is fully offset in other income and has no impact on net earnings. The remaining $183 million is primarily due to normalization of expenses following our temporary store closures last year to support the increase in sales as well as higher incentive compensation expenses due to our strong first quarter results.  \n SG&A expenses include $13 million of COVID-related safety costs, which in light of the latest CDC guidance, we expect these costs to decline significantly beginning in the second quarter. Compared to 2019's non-GAAP results, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales leveraged 446 basis points from -- due to the significant sales increase. SG&A dollars increased $122.3 million due to increases in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales and hourly wage rate investments and COVID-related safety costs as well as higher incentive compensation expenses.  \n Driven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, we delivered record quarterly non-GAAP EBT and EBT margin results. Non-GAAP EBT was $477.1 million or 16.35% of net sales, and it increased $684.8 million or approximately 3,200 basis points from the same period last year. More relevantly, compared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $396 million or approximately 1,200 basis points as a percent of net sales.  \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79. This is compared to a net loss per share of $1.71 last year and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.62 in 2019, a 511% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $3.41. This includes $7.3 million in noncash interest expense as well as 9.2 million additional shares that will be offset by our bond hedged at settlement but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation. Both are related to the convertible notes we issued in the first quarter of 2020. For additional details on this, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables of our press release that we issued this morning.  \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We're in a strong financial position, ending Q1 with approximately $1.86 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility. While our quarter-end inventory levels decreased 4% compared to the same period last year, our strong flow of products supported Q1 sales growth in excess of our expectations. Looking ahead, our inventory is very clean and we continue to expect a robust product flow.  \n In terms of supply chain expense, we are seeing elevated costs, which we expect to continue but thus far have mitigated this pressure through higher ticket as a result of being less promotional and increasing prices in select categories.  \n Turning to our first quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $57.2 million, and we paid $33 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we also repurchased just over 1 million shares of our stock for $76.8 million at an average price of $74.59. And we have approximately $954 million remaining under our share repurchase program, and our plan for 2021 continues to include a minimum of $200 million of share repurchases.  \n Now let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings. As a result of our significant Q1 results, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance and now expect full year comp sales to increase by 8% to 11% compared to our prior expectation of down 2% to up 2%. At the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 22% sales increase versus 2019 compared to our prior expectation above 11%.  \n While we have been very pleased with the start of our second quarter and are highly encouraged about the rest of the year, beginning in June, we will start to anniversary significant comp sales gains from last year. There's also continued uncertainty around when consumer behavior will normalize and what the new normal will be. And we are limited in our ability to forecast demand, particularly as it relates to the second half.  \n Given this, within our updated outlook, we have maintained our Q3 and Q4 performance expectations in line with our original guidance, which assumes comps will decline in the range of high single to low double digits. Non-GAAP EBT is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion compared to our prior outlook of $550 million to $650 million, which at the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 142% versus 2019 and up 45% versus 2020. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10%.  \n Within this, gross margin is expected to increase versus 2019, driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins. When compared to 2020, gross margin is also expected to increase, driven by leverage on fixed expenses, while merchandise margins are expected to be approximately flat. This assumes a gradual normalization of promotions beginning in the second quarter and modest deleverage on fixed expenses in the second half. \n SG&A expense is expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020 due to the significant projected increase in full year sales. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2021, we transitioned last year's premium pay program to a more lasting compensation program, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums. The impact of these programs has been included within our guidance. \n In total, we are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $8 to $8.70 compared to our prior outlook of $4.40 to $5.20. At the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated EPS guidance is up 126% versus 2019 and up 36% versus 2020. Our updated earnings guidance is based on 97 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. \n In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q1 results and remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and operator, you may now open the line for questions. We're not anticipating a return to full normal that we might have seen in 2018 and 2019, but we are anticipating a gradual return of promotions kind of beginning here later in Q2 and then building throughout the back half of the year. Well, a couple of things. Team Sports has its highest penetration in the business typically in the first quarter. And then that's followed by the third quarter as the second highest penetration and then the second and the fourth. Fourth quarter is the lowest penetration. So we did really well with Team Sports in the first quarter, and that's in its highest penetration quarter. So we're excited about it. We were well inventoried coming into the quarter, expecting a resurgence, and we were able to meet that demand. \n With respect to the cash that we have on the balance sheet right now, overall, we intend to continue to be conservative on maintaining cash balances. However, we're able to support the investments in new concepts that we have going forward. We're able to invest in working capital. We haven't rebuilt our inventories yet but we are continuing to be fairly aggressive on our inventory buys for the back half of the year. So even though in our guidance, we have anticipated sales down 10%, approximately 10% to last year, up 10% to 2019, we are going to be buying to support continued comp sales gains as -- because we don't want to kind of lead the consumer there, and we want to let our customer tell us when they're ready to slow down. So we're going to have the inventory and we have the working capital, and we have the cash to go do that and make those bets. \n Ed had talked earlier, and as had Lauren, that we're going to continue to invest in our stores and new concepts. We are maintaining our guidance on buying back $200 million of -- at least $200 million of stock this year. And we expect to continue to make our dividend payments as we've increased those over the last several years. So we have a lot of uses for it. But having said that, we anticipate continuing to be conservatively capitalized and maintaining a sizable cash balance. And I would just add to that, due to the strength of demand kind of across our product assortment, we're not really creating much in the way of clearance merchandise. So we don't have a little bit of an anchor on our merchandise margin rates coming from dealing with clearance that we would typically have. And the clearance stores that we've opened have also helped us to more efficiently deal with our clearance inventory. So structurally, that's helped us with our merchandise margin rates, but the strong demand has helped us as well. Michael, we're going to have to see how the back half of the year settles out this year. I think there's still quite a few unknowns about what the new level of demand is that's out there within our product categories. We know it's going to be -- we're very confident it's going to be significantly higher than 2019, and we become meaningfully more optimistic about that as we get longer and longer into this run we're making right now. But we certainly feel better about higher levels of operating margin than we did 3 months ago, 6 months ago. But I don't think we're ready to guide on what the long-term margin outlook is yet until we see kind of a normalization of spending on travel, on restaurants and how that affects our categories. But certainly, the consumer is saying they want to continue to be outside, trying to -- continue to try to get fit, buying athletic apparel, athletic footwear, playing golf. And I think a lot of those trends are going to stay with us for some time, but we've got to let this play out a little bit before we can get the long-term view. The merchandise margin rates are running higher now than they were at peak because -- simply because we just don't have any promotions right now, and we have very little clearance merchandise to work with, and we've never really been in a position where we haven't had to run promotions. Now that's going to be -- as we go forward, it's going to be a matter of when the promotions return at what level. We're encouraged by some of the activities of some of our brands. We have been narrowing distribution of product and have been narrowing it basically away from some of the players that have typically led promotions in the past. So we're excited about that and what the outlook could be around promotions there. We're encouraged by the restraint there's been on putting product into the various channels as well. So product continues to be -- product levels continue to be pretty thin, which suggests a continuing of favorable margins. So the merch margin, as we look out, should continue to be favorable, but right now, we're running meaningfully higher than we were at peak. \n The start of the quarter, how does it impact fiscal year guidance? We baked some of the beat from Q2 into the guidance. We -- the guidance rolls in our first quarter beat versus what our expectations were and a little bit from Q2. At the low end, it's got a small beat from Q2. At the higher end, it's got a little bit of a bigger beat from Q2, but we are flowing through some increases from the second quarter as well. We're not going to give the specific numbers around the second quarter. However, we're very pleased with the start. And really in June, we start to come up against these significant double-digit comp sales gains and coming to Father's Day and beginning of back-to-school. So we're going to have to let it play out here as we start to come up against the big gains that we saw in the kind of the back half here of the second quarter. Well, I think generally, there are more tailwinds behind the ticket side in the transaction to what will remain to be played out here. But as we continue to be not very promotional and not getting back to normal kind of levels of promotion really this year, that bodes well for ticket. Also, we've seen trading up in some areas as well, particularly like in golf where there's a better inventory supply of new products than there is in cascaded prior year products. The consumers showed a willingness to trade up and we expect that trend to continue. \n So I think that there's pretty good tailwinds around ticket around promotions, lack of clearance, trading up a bit to some better products. So we feel good about that. Transactions, we're going to have to let that play out and see when as folks get back to kind of normalized activities and travel and so on. But we continue to get the trips, the high level of trips that we're getting now into our stores. Our comp sales in stores have been fantastic and we'll continue to get the traffic online as well. But I'd tell you, the outlook for ticket is good. The outlook for traffic may be good but we're not that certain around it. I mean, Going, Going, Gone! and clearance, we have a couple of different concepts within here. But at this point, they're handling clearance product coming from DICK'S stores. The DICK'S stores have been generating less clearance but we certainly have enough to give us a good test in these stores. It is moving the gross margin needle, the gross margins. The merchandise margins that we're getting out of these stores are considerably higher than when we handle clearance merchandise within the DICK'S stores. So we're really pleased with that. \n And it's still a test for us. We're going to read it for a while and make a determination. But so far, the signs are good that at a minimum, it's helping us with clearance in the DICK'S stores and maybe there's an opportunity to make some money at it over the long term. But we're going to test it and see how it works for us. Right. And I'll just say that we've got a really, really good relationship, at this point, with Federal Express and meet with them regularly as they talk about different ways to get product to our athletes more quickly. So while we do look at opportunities to bring capabilities in-house, we're really pleased with the partnership we've got with the team at FedEx. And they've been extremely helpful in coming up with new ideas as well. Yes. I mean, it does come down to mix and there was more clearance in the fourth quarter of 2019 than -- and first quarter is not a big clearance quarter for us. So you're on it, Chris. And call it, last year, back-to-school, I'd say was smaller than typical because a lot of kids didn't go back to school and it came later because many of the schools were delayed for several weeks before they got going. So there's a big opportunity between the child tax credit that's coming and the smaller and delayed back-to-school to get the third quarter off to a good start. I mean, we're seeing strength across the country right now. Probably seeing a little bit more strength in the states that were closed for longer like in the Northeast and California. But nationwide, we're seeing strength. Yes. We certainly believe that it helped the business but I wouldn't want to put a number on it. The business was in good shape going into the stimulus. We did get a nice lift when those checks started hitting. But the business has continued to be strong throughout the first quarter and going into the second quarter as well. So... I wouldn't say that. So I would say that versus '19, I think our biggest concern is when people start traveling over the summer and they're booking vacations and spending in restaurants and going to concerts and things like that, where is the share going to be? And I think that's more of our concern than stimulus because there is actually some new stimulus coming beginning in July with the child tax credit that is going to start to be distributed on a monthly basis."

[Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the call over to our host, Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. On today's call will be Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. The playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.\n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.\n Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. And finally, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our first quarter 2023 earnings results on May 23, 2023.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our 2022 results, which demonstrate the continued success strength of our business as we realize the benefits of our long-term transformation through focused strategies and strong execution. Our athletes are passionate about healthy active lifestyles and they've continued to prioritize sport and rely on DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet their needs. Importantly, we continued to gain market share at an accelerating pace with considerable growth in our largest and most important categories. Our fourth quarter was a strong ending to another strong year. This Q4, we achieved record quarterly sales of $3.6 billion, and our comps increased 5.3%.\n This strong comp was on top of a 6.6% comp last year, a 19.3% comp in 2020 and a 5.3% comp in 2019. And for this fourth quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.93, significantly ahead of any pre-COVID Q4 in our history. For the full year, we achieved sales of $12.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EBT margin was 11.4%, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $12.04. To put this in context, when you look at our 2022 performance versus 2019, our sales increased 41% or $3.6 billion.\n Our merchandise margin increased more than 300 basis points. Our non-GAAP EBT margin more than doubled and our non-GAAP EPS is more than 3x higher than 2019. Our strong performance and financial strength position us to increase the rate of investment in our business to fuel long-term growth opportunities and also return significant capital to shareholders. The step change increase in our dividend that we announced today, more than doubling our annualized payout to $4 per share or $1 on a quarterly basis, clearly reflects our strong conviction and a structurally higher sales and earnings profile of our business and our ongoing focus on delivering shareholder value.\n With 2023 marking our company's 75th anniversary, this is an incredibly exciting time for DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our company was founded in 1948 by Dick Stack with a dream and $300 from his grandmother's cookie jar. Under Ed's leadership, it's grown from a small bait-and-tackle shop to become the preeminent sporting goods retailer in the country. I've had the honor of working alongside Ed for over a decade and we will continue partnering to drive the business forward.\n While we will take the time to celebrate our heritage, we believe it's just as important to use this milestone as an opportunity to look forward. Our future is extremely bright, and we have great momentum as we write the next chapter in our growth story. Our 2022 results provide a strong foundation upon which we will build in 2023 and in the years ahead.\n In 2023, we will grow both our sales and earnings through positive comps, a return to square footage growth and higher merchandise margin. We expect our comparable store sales to be in the range of flat to positive 2%. We expect our earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.80, which at the midpoint is up 11% versus 2022.\n We will continue to create and define our future and as the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, we are well positioned to extend our lead and continue gaining share in a fragmented $140 billion industry. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for delivering another strong year and for their passion, hard work and dedication to our business.\n At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great. And none of what we would have accomplished -- none of what we have accomplished -- excuse me, would have been possible without our exceptional team.\n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results, outlook and capital allocation in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2022 results. Consolidated sales increased 0.6% to a record-setting $12.37 billion and the comparable store sales decreased 0.5%. When compared to 2019, sales increased 41.3% or $3.62 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our structurally higher sales compared to pre-COVID levels.\n Importantly, if you look at some of the slides that we have inserted in our investor deck, you will see that approximately 80% of our growth was driven by sales in our priority categories of footwear, athletic apparel, team sports and golf, where we gained considerable market share. These gains are the direct results of our differentiated product, enhanced service and elevated experience we provide to our athletes.\n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit for the full year was $4.29 billion or 34.65% of net sales and declined 368 basis points from last year. However, our gross profit increased 531 basis points over 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. As expected, the year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 303 basis points. When compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate was up 308 basis points, it's important to highlight that we maintain the majority of the merchandise margin expansion that we drove over the prior 2 years. We also saw a significant leverage of 306 basis points in occupancy cost due to our structurally higher sales.\n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $2.78 billion or 22.45% of net sales and deleveraged 78 basis points from last year. SG&A dollars increased $112 million, primarily due to investments in hourly wage rates, talent and technology to support our growth strategy. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. When compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A leveraged 178 basis points due to the significant sales increase.\n Interest expense was $95.2 million, an increase of $68.2 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $52.8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current year also included $23.3 million of inducement charges that were partially offset by cash interest savings both related to our exchange of approximately $516 million, a principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, non-GAAP EBT was $1.41 billion or 11.43% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $440.5 million or 5.03% of net sales in 2019, an increase of close to $1 billion, or 640 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\n The additional slides that we have included in our investor deck highlight the key drivers of our structurally higher profitability today versus pre-COVID. These include significant leverage of fixed costs due to our structurally higher sales base, a structurally higher merchandise margin due to our differentiated product assortment, more granular pricing management and the merchandising mix benefits and the improved e-commerce profitability, which is now in line with the total company EBT margin.\n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.04. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $15.70 last year and is more than 3x our 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5 -- of sorry, $3.69.\n Now moving to our Q4 results. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.3% to $3.6 billion. This was the largest sales quarter in the history of DICK'S Sporting Goods. Comparable store sales increased 5.3% on top of a 6.6% increase in the same period last year and 19.3% increase in Q4 of 2020 and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019.\n Our strong comps were driven by a 7.6% increase in transactions, partially offset by a 2.3% decline in average ticket. Within our portfolio, our priority categories did very well, driven by our differentiated assortment across footwear, athletic apparel and team sports. When compared to 2019, sales increased 37.9% or $988.1 million.\n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.17 billion or 32.44% of net sales and declined 514 basis points versus last year. However, our gross profit increased 384 basis points over Q4 of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 640 basis points and partially offset by lower supply chain costs.\n As planned, during the holiday season, we provided our athletes with a series of compelling item level deals. Additionally, we continue to address targeted inventory overages due to the late arriving Sprint product. As a result of these actions, our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We are taking in new receipts and could not be more excited about our spring assortment. Importantly, when compared to 2019, Q4 '22 margin rate is 209 basis points higher, driven by a differentiated assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategy and a favorable product mix. These are the same key contributors to our structurally higher margins that we have been emphasizing.\n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $823.7 million or 22.9% of net sales and leveraged 48 basis points compared to last year. Interest expense was $18 million, an increase of $9.2 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $11.4 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion senior notes issued in January of fiscal '21.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, non-GAAP EBT was $350.5 million or 9.74% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $148.6 million or 5.7% of net sales in 2019, an increase of $201.9 million or [ 404 ] basis points as a percentage of net sales. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.93. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64 last year and represents a 122% increase over 2019's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32.\n As Lauren said, we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us, particularly in our core business with DICK's House of Sport. As a result, we plan to convert our 17 existing Field & Stream stores, the majority of which are part of DICK'S Field & Stream combo store to DICK's House of Sport or larger format DICK's stores and exit the Field & Stream brand.\n We closed 12 of these stores during Q4, and we plan to convert the remaining stores by 2024. As a result, in Q4, we incurred pretax charges totaling $30.1 million, primarily noncash impairments of Field & Stream store assets. These charges, along with certain items related to our convertible senior notes were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60. For additional details on this, you can refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, with no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Quarter inventory levels increased 23% compared to Q4 of last year. As a reminder, we were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the more useful comparison is against 2019. Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned.\n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $89.8 million, and we paid $39.3 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased approximately 610,000 shares of our stock for $66 million at an average price of $107.53. Furthermore, following the exchange of approximately $95 million of the outstanding principle of our convertible senior notes, we gave notice in February to the convertible noteholders that the remaining $59 million will be redeemed in shares for the total principal plus the accrued interest. We expect these notes to be fully paid off by April 18.\n Now let me move to our 2023 outlook, which will be for 53-week year. Coming off of 2 consecutive record years in 2020 and 2021, our 2022 results provide a strong foundation upon which we will build in 2023 and in the years ahead. Let's review the details. Comparable store sales are expected to be in the range of flat to positive 2%, with comps expected to be stronger in the first half due to improved inventory availability.\n At the midpoint, EBT margin is expected to be approximately 11.7%, driven by increase in gross margins. This includes an expected improvement in merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs. Q1 gross margin is expected to meaningfully improve versus Q4, but be modestly down year-over-year primarily due to lower merchandise margins partially offset by improving freight expenses.\n We expect both gross margins and merchandise margins to sequentially improve through the year. SG&A expenses are expected to deleverage primarily due to investments to fund our growth strategy. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $55 million, which is down approximately $40 million year-over-year due to the inducement charges that we incurred throughout 2022 as we repurchase our convertible debt and related interest savings.\n In total, we anticipate earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.80, which includes approximately $0.20 coming from the 53rd week. At the midpoint of this range, EPS is up 11% versus 2022 or up 5% (sic) [ 9% ]on a 52-week comparable basis. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, which is driven by a favorable rate impact on the vesting of employee equity awards in the first quarter.\n I'll conclude with a brief discussion around capital allocation priorities. Investing in our business drive profitable organic growth remains our top priority. We also remain committed to returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. In fact, over the past 2 years, we have returned nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders, which included approximately $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $766 million of dividend, all while continuing to invest in the profitable growth of our business. Where appropriate, we will pursue acquisitions to amplify our growth and add new capabilities for the future. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to a healthy balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.\n For 2023, our capital allocation plan includes capital expenditures of $550 million to $600 million. We will make significant investments to grow our business and drive athlete engagement. And as Lauren said, we are excited to return to growing our square footage. DICK'S House of Sport will be the primary driver of the square footage growth. In 2023, we will open 9 new DICK'S House of Sport locations, 8 of which are existing DICK'S and Field & Stream combo store conversions, along with 1 relocation.\n We will also begin construction on more than 10 new DICK'S House of Sport locations that will open throughout 2024. In 2023, we will grow the footprint of our Golf Galaxy business through Golf Galaxy Performance Center and convert temporary value chain stores to permanent locations. In addition, we will convert over additional 100 stores to premium full-service footwear, taking this elevated athlete experience to over 75% of our DICK'S locations.\n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today, we announced a considerable increase in our dividends of 105% to an annualized payout of $4 per share or $1 on a quarterly basis. This dividend increase is based on our confidence in our structurally higher sales and earnings profile and reflects our conviction in our strategies and future growth trajectory.\n In addition, our 2023 plan includes our expectation of $300 million of share repurchases to offset dilution. The effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider using our excess cash flow to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $300 million.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to Lauren to review some of the key initiatives that will propel our profitable long-term growth. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Navdeep. At DICK'S, we've been reinventing sports for 75 years. Over this time, we've grown significantly to become the largest omnichannel sports retailer in the U.S., a $140 billion industry, and the #1 premium golf and team sports destination in the world. We provide an unrivaled athletic apparel and footwear experience to our athletes. And we are the most important U.S. retail partner to many of the world's leading sports brands.\n Since 2017, we have transformed virtually every aspect of our business and have added $3.6 billion in sales over the last 3 years. We are well positioned to extend our leadership in a large fragmented industry and have never been more excited about the future of DICK'S. Within merchandising, we've built an industry-leading assortment known for differentiated and on-trend product. Our ability to showcase an entire brand portfolio is highly valued by our strategic partners, and our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever. We're also developing relationships with new and emerging brands, and at the same time, have created powerhouse vertical brands that collectively represent the second largest brand in our company.\n In our stores, we've invested in our teammate experience in training to heighten our team's ability to provide an enhanced level of service to our athletes, all while continuing to make DICK'S a fun and rewarding place to work. We believe strongly that highly engaged teammates are critical to providing a great experience for our athletes. And our culture is one of our key competitive advantages.\n In 2022, we were named one of Fortune's Best Workplaces in Retail. And just last month, we were named one of America's best large employers by Forbes. Along with enhanced service, we've leveraged distinct in-store elements powered by technology to provide an unparalleled athlete experience. Experiential in-store elements such as HitTrax batting cages, TrackMan golf simulators and premium full-service footwear decks, inspire confidence in our athletes and reinforce the power of our expertise.\n These strategies in combination with our personalized marketing engine and brand building efforts are working. We added 7 million new athletes during the year and reached record highs in our active athlete database in Q4. Our new athletes continue to skew younger and more female, representing a great opportunity for future growth. Importantly, our gold athletes, our most valuable cohort hit a record high of over 7 million people, equating to nearly 30% of our active scorecard members.\n We're seeing very strong retention with our gold athletes and they continue to drive meaningful sales growth, representing well over 40% of total sales. We've also launched new concepts such as Public Lands and Golf Galaxy Performance Center to better serve enthusiast outdoor athletes and golfers and recently announced that we will be acquiring leading outdoor retailer, Moosejaw, a reaffirmation of our commitment to growth in the multibillion-dollar outdoor category.\n However, there is no greater example of our commitment to innovation within the athlete experience than DICK'S House of Sport. DICK's House of Sport is redefining sports retail. It's an experiential destination that was inspired by Ed as he challenged us to create a concept that if built across the street from a DICK'S Sporting Goods store would put that store out of business.\n It's this way of thinking that drives us to continue to innovate and create market-leading disruption. House of Sport is an experience that fosters deep community involvement goes well beyond traditional retail and has become a destination where athletes can fuel their passions. Since launching House of Sport in 2021, our initial 3 locations have exceeded our expectations, driving strong engagement with our brand partners while delivering much higher total sales and profit as well as much higher sales and profit on a per square foot basis.\n House of Sport will be a significant part of our future growth story. Over the next 2 years, we plan to open around 20 additional locations, including Downtown Boston and our 2 hometowns of Pittsburgh and Binghamton, New York. And over the next 5 years, we could have as many as 75 to 100 House of Sport across the country. We are also continuing to pull key learnings into our core DICK'S fleet. In fact, later this year, we're excited to open the next-generation 50,000 square foot DICK'S store in South Bend, Indiana, which will reflect the House of Sport learnings for our athletes. For those who haven't yet had the chance to visit a House of Sport in person, which we highly recommend, we've added a short video to our Investor Relations website to help bring the experience to life.\n Across our ecosystem, we will continue to improve our omnichannel experience. For decades, we focused on making meaningful investments in technology with the long game in mind. Our athletes desired touch points have evolved significantly over the years, and we think about how to best meet their needs through a personalized experience enabled by technology and arguably the best data set in sports.\n We continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes who spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. We're excited by the results these investments are generating and believe our capabilities are distinctive in our industry and provide a long-term competitive advantage. As we expand our leadership position in youth sports, GameChanger plays a pivotal role.\n GameChanger is the premier scoring and statistics mobile app for youth sports and is a leader in the multibillion-dollar sports technology market. As a recurring revenue Software-as-a-Service company. GameChanger has delivered 5-year revenue CAGR of 35%, while also being profitable, a function of its business model, which delivers some of the best unit economics in consumer technology. With GameChanger, we are connecting youth athletes to their teammates, coaches and families through score-keeping and live streaming, all on one easy-to-use mobile app.\n Over the past 2 years, our GameChanger team transformed its user experience to incorporate video streaming highlights and 8 [ new ] sports, all delivered to athletes and their families on their phones and tablets anywhere they are. Every year, nearly 6 million games are covered on GameChanger and athletes and their families engaged with the platform for over 280 million hours. To put this in perspective, more games are covered in a single spring month on GameChanger than have been played in the entire history of Major League Baseball. We were honored to see GameChanger named to Fast Company's list of the World's Most Innovative Companies for 2023 and also be named as a finalist for the Sports Business Journal Tech awards that will be held later today. Looking ahead, we will continue innovating within youth sports technology and strengthening this important connection with athletes.\n Lastly, we have big plans for our brand in 2023. Over the years, our brand marketing has inspired athletes to participate in sports and our Sports Matter program has made it possible for more youth athletes to experience the unique and life-altering benefits that youth sports provide. We believe it's time to blend the inspiration and aspiration that's always been a part of our brand marketing efforts with the raw power and emotion of our Sports Matter initiative.\n To make that happen, we're really pleased to share that we will be relaunching our brand during the upcoming NCAA tournament with a campaign focused on the power of sports to change lives. We are so proud of the great work our team has done. And if you're watching the tournament, men's or women's, I promise you will not miss it.\n In addition, we're combining this with a commitment from our foundation of more than $5 million to fund 75 youth sports organizations, each with a $75,000 grant to keep kids playing.\n In closing, we want to reiterate that our strong Q4 and 2022 performance is the direct result of our strategies, our agility in meeting the evolving needs of our athletes and our relentless drive to innovate all supported by outstanding execution from our team. Since 1948, DICK'S has believed in the power of sports to change lives, and we are committed to bringing this belief to life through our athlete experience, brand engagement, differentiated product and, most importantly, our people.\n These are the pillars of the new foundation of growth for our business, and we believe that no one is better positioned to lead in the marketplace. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across our stores, distribution centers and customer support center for their outstanding efforts and continued commitment to our business.\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the '23 merchant margin guidance that's [ being up ]. Can you tell us the source, the mix underlying initial markups less promo? And then is the '22 level of merch margin, is that the baseline that you're underwriting has number we won't fall beneath. \nLauren Hobart: Simeon, yes, our fiscal '22 level of merch margin is indeed a new baseline. We are planning to grow our merch margin going forward. I'll turn to Navdeep to answer the breakdown of where we think that will come from next year. \nNavdeep Gupta: Simeon, as we articulated in our guidance, we expect the profitability of the business to improve next year, driven by both growth in our merchandise margin and gross margin. And as we talked about it, we are very optimistic about continuing to grow our top line and profitability on the long-term basis as well. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. I guess the follow-up switch to sales. One of the factors or a lot of factors have driven the better sales performance I think some of the narrow distribution, which is also a reflection of how well you've done that DICK'S is getting key product [ high heat ] has helped. What's your line of sight that this structure holds that DICK'S continues to be a place with exclusive unique product and that the marketplace doesn't evolve to be more widespread. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. You're absolutely right that our product mix and our assortment is a key driver of our growth, and it's been a driver of our growth in our transformation, and it will be going forward. we believe there has been a structural change in our business over the last 5 years. First of all, we've seen a shift in consumer behavior where they are prioritizing athletic endeavor sports, health and active -- heath and -- healthy excuse me, and active lifestyle, and they're prioritizing DICK'S in order to meet those needs. But as you mentioned, we've also completely revamped our athlete experience. So we've got omnichannel capabilities that people are leaning into. We've got a great service model that we continue to focus on. And we brought in experiences such as HitTrax and TrackMan into our overall experience so that people can really feel confident in the goods that they're buying.\n And then lastly, our ability to showcase a brand from head to toe and to really put a brand forward and the best light possible has become a big advantage. So our distribution, our access to products, the fact that we now have products all the way from opening price point up to what the enthusiast will desire to meet their needs on the field is absolutely part of our ongoing strategy. We're very confident in that growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. And nice end to a great year. Lauren, I wanted to focus sort of on the maybe longer-term horizon on the new concept and the store growth. It sounds like you're now back into the acceleration of square footage and the stores that are being opened are much larger in size, I think. Can you talk about kind of the sales productivity of those boxes and the EBIT contribution and how we should think about that sort of impacting the consolidated 4-wall. And then my follow-up, Navdeep is also on that, in that kind of top line environment, what do longer-term kind of EBT margins look like maybe on a 3-year or 5-year horizon, if you will. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. You're absolutely correct that we are leaning into new store growth and specifically due to the experience we've had with House of Sport, the fact that the 3 experiences that we built as really concept stores have become scalable, highly profitable, more sales, more profit, both on a total basis as well as a square footage basis, we are leaning into that growth. And so we will have 9 that are being built this year from remodels and one relocation as well as 10 in the pipeline for 2024 that we're already going to start construction this year. we're very, very bullish on House of Sport and what this can do for our athlete experience in our business. Navdeep? \nNavdeep Gupta: Adrienne, great question. I think maybe there is 2 ways to answer this. First of all, like we have said 2022 is the new baseline foundation upon which we will grow our sales and earnings over the long term. As also Lauren noted, as we look to the future, we still believe there is a tremendous amount of share gain opportunity for us. We are the largest sporting goods company. And right now, our share in $140 billion industry is just 8%. So as we look to the future, that is we are very optimistic about the opportunity that we have to continue to provide differentiated assortment and service to our athletes and continue to gain share. I'm not willing to give today a long-term rubric, but here's the way to think about it, that we believe we can continue to drive positive comps, continue to grow our square footage and continue to expand our profitability into the future. And we are very optimistic, as you can see based on the guidance that we have provided that for 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: I think 2 questions, just -- I just want to -- I think this is kind of obvious, but the cadence of comps in 2023, could you give a little more color? Are they sort of strongest in the first quarter and then fade through the year and at a 0 to 2. I think you're implying that we should be doing negative same-store sales for the back half of the year. I just want to confirm that.\n And then the other question is somewhat related. Just the average transaction size was, I think you guys said down in the fourth quarter, I think 2.3%. That doesn't -- you guys don't have negative average transaction size often? Is it -- can you give us color on it? Is it weak, large ticket or lack of price increases? And then also related to that, the traffic was obviously offset that. Was that store -- more store traffic or more online transactions? Any color on these things around same-store sales would be great. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robby. I'll start off. The cadence of comps in fiscal '23, you're correct. That we will expect -- we do expect comps to be stronger in the first half than the second half. As you think back to last year at this time, Q1 and Q2, we had significant inventory challenges. That's the whole reason why the inventory came in late as the year went on. And it was difficult to put together a really fantastic athlete experience. At this point, our spring product is in. I would actually encourage you to go to a DICK'S store and take a look. We have a fantastic assortment.\n And so due to the comps from last year and the confidence we have in our business, we do expect comps to be very strong in the first half. As you look towards the back half of the year, we're just being cautious. We're up against a 6% comp, and we want to reflect that the comps will moderate. I'll turn it -- I will turn it over to Navdeep to break down some of your further questions. But I do want to start by saying your question about transaction size, I think you have to start with the fact that transactions were up 7.6%.\n So while there was a slight decline in average ticket and we don't break out whether that's AUR, UPT, we did find that there were more athletes, so we have more athletes in our database. They shopped more frequently. And in total, they spent more. So delivering a 5.3% comp with that level of transaction size, we're really, really pleased with that. \nNavdeep Gupta: Robby, I think Lauren covered that answered really well. Maybe another way to think about this is if you look at our -- the same transaction and ticket versus 2019, we saw much balanced performance. So that maybe is another way to think about that. And then as you look to the guidance overall, we are remaining very optimistic and confident about the guidance that we have provided here for 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We wondered if we could go back to the merchandise margins and the gross margin guide in terms of what is driving the improvement that you expect for gross margins in '23. Is it because we're lapping such severe inventory issues and promotions in '22 that you expect things to be a little bit better? Is there something changing with the vendor relationships or the merch margin to be a little bit better? Any drill down there would be really helpful. \nNavdeep Gupta: Kate, this is Navdeep. So we gave 2 color commentary around the gross margin expectation. First, that we expect that the merch margin and gross margins will improve into 2023, 2 drivers merch margin as well as the lower freight expenses that we will start to see the benefit into 2023 as well. In terms of a little bit of more cadence around gross -- merch margin itself, as you can imagine, the inventory positions in Q1, both for us as well as the -- in the industry was pretty lean and was pretty constrained. So as we are annualizing that, we expect some level of normalization of the pricing in the first half and that's what we gave in our kind of a cadence for the merch margin expansion. And as you think about the back half, we also expect the freight expenses to start to have the benefit as the inventory starts to turn because we capitalize those expenses. So that's the other factor that we have contemplated in our guidance. \nLauren Hobart: Kate, I just want to pick up one other part of your question. You asked whether we're lapping severe inventory issues or promotions. I want to be very clear that while we managed through a lot of inventory disruptions last year, there was no return to an overall promotional environment. We cleared due inventory through our value chain stores, through our Going, Going, Gone! chain, and we were able to keep the DICK'S store really looking great for holiday with an assortment of full-price merchandise. And that really was true throughout the entire year. So promotions, I just want to pick up on the -- story that comes up all the time, promotions were not a key factor in our year, last year. There was price item discounts, especially on lumps, but it wasn't a highly promotional environment for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: I have a couple of top line-related questions as well. So first, as you think about how you're planning the business you've referenced 2019 up until this point, we're getting to a period is 2019 even a good reference point. So are you looking at things on a 4-year basis? And then more broadly, is the expectation that your business sort of reverts to like a normal seasonal cadence over the year? And then related to that, just as you think about that back half and that hard compare, to what extent do you think that the promotions elevated the comp trend in the back half of the year as -- in terms of like some sales that you're just going to have to naturally get back? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Chris. We have been talking in 2019 just due to all of the ups and downs of the past few years, but we will not be doing that going forward. And '22 is the new base from which we're going to grow. We're going to grow the top line and bottom line. And yes, it is our hope that this year, finally, there is some normalized seasonal cadence just because with the inventory challenges for last year and the impact that had on consumer shopping behavior as well as some of the issues people are having with inflation. All of that will -- we're hoping will normalize this year so that we can continue to plan from this going forward.\n Important point and related to what I was just saying to Kate, our promotions did not elevate our comp trends in the second half. In fact, most of the inventory liquidation that we had happened in our value chain and in our warehouse stores, which don't affect our comp, our comp was driven by transactions, 7.6% increase in transactions. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Geez I hate to ask too mundane and boring modeling questions, but I did want to ask you about your 2020 sales growth or sales outlook versus comps, we can probably estimate the extra week, but is Moosejaw, which I think is a couple of hundred million dollars supposed to close in March. Is that in the guidance? Or would that be above and beyond? \nLauren Hobart: Go ahead, Navdeep. \nNavdeep Gupta: Mike, Moosejaw is not included in our guidance as the transaction has not yet closed. So we will include that commentary in our next quarter's outlook. \nLauren Hobart: It's not likely to be material. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Fine. Okay. And then a second modeling question. Talk to us about interest income was a big driver to earnings in the fourth quarter. What is -- you told us what interest expense should be in 2023. Can you tell us what interest income is expected within your EBT guidance? \nNavdeep Gupta: That's a great question, Mike. I think it will all depend on what do we do with the excess cash as we have also included in our guidance that we will continue to remain opportunistic with our share buyback. So depending on what we do with the share buyback, that will have an impact on the interest income. But you rightfully said, with the current interest environment that we have, we are able to get a good yield on our excess cash on the balance sheet. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So you mentioned that the 30 -- the 2022 percent a 34.6% gross margin -- let me start that again. You mentioned that the 2022 gross margin of 34.6% is the new level from which you'll start to move higher from over -- from here. Yet the 34.6% gross margin last year had a significant amount of inventory liquidation within that. So plus you have the benefit of lower transportation costs. So a, why wouldn't you get more of that back? And to what degree are you just assuming that transportation costs are going to drive the gross margin in 2023.\n In a nutshell, why isn't your gross margin going to be even better moving forward? Are you expecting that promotions are going to increase, and that will provide a little bit of an offset? \nNavdeep Gupta: Michael, let's make sure we understand your question currently because maybe I'll begin with the middle part of your question. You indicated that the transportation cost was a benefit in 2022. Actually, that is not the case because we recognize the freight expenses over the turn of the inventory. So by the time we started to see the early benefits of the freight expenses by the time it rolls through, we actually will start to see the benefit in the second half of 2023.\n And in terms of the guidance, that's kind of the first part of your question, what we said about both the sales and the profitability and we're not indicating to the gross margins. We're talking about the overall profitability of the company is the new baseline. So we are very confident in the guidance that we gave that we will improve both the merch margin and gross profit into 2023 over where we finished 2022. \nMichael Lasser: Here's the better way to maybe ask the question because it wasn't clear, and I apologize for that. Why wouldn't you get back to the 38% gross margin you had in 2021 when there was less inventory clearance and you should have the favorable transportation costs on top of that? And just in case I want to add my second question, how did the stores that had the full complement of assortment for priority category do compared to the stores that did not have as elevated an assortment within priority categories in the fourth quarter. Did you see a material difference in the comp in those 2 cohorts of stores. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I'll take the first part, and I'll turn to Lauren for the second one. In terms of over time, like we have said, there is nothing structurally that is holding us back from achieving that level of profitability that we delivered in 2021. So over time, Michael, your comment is appropriate. And maybe Lauren, you can take the second one. \nLauren Hobart: Sure. Yes. I mean if you think about our priority categories of footwear, athletic apparel, team sports, footwear in our premium full-service footwear decks, we are making a larger investment in those, as you heard in our prepared remarks because it does allow us to have a full assortment, which does really delight the athlete and enable us to drive strong comps. Beyond that, we're not going to break down how it was -- how we did in Q4 by various categories. But generally speaking, our assortment was really strong and drove the comp. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Great, great quarter and year. Congratulations. So my first question is just -- I mean a bit of a follow-up. And look, there's obviously a lot of talk in your broader space about inventory clearance and our normalizing promotions. So if I hear what you're saying, is that promotions did not drive the business in the second half of the year. You're actually optimistic as we look into the first half of '23, the better inventory availability will help you drive improved sales or further improved sales at DICK'S. So the question I have is, is DICK'S then just not affected by promotions outside of your company, what you're seeing with other brands or other retailers? Have you just been managing through that? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So DICK'S is -- I can't say it's not affected by any promotions outside of our company, but our assortment is so narrowly distributed now and just differentiated that we don't spend a lot of time looking at an outside promotional environment. We have an extensive database of 150 million people. We can manage on a personalized basis what pricing we want to offer, and we are very much more focused on strategic investments in price item where necessary to move our business. \nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. And congrats on that. And then the second question I have also just looking at DICK'S relative to what else is happening out there. So a number of retailers have talked lately about pressure within their consumer, whether it be inflation or some other type of economic factors. Clearly, your sales improved here. So I guess the question I have is, are you seeing any signs of a more pressured consumer behind your strong results and as we look into '23, what's the basic macro assumption underpinning the guidance you outlined today? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks. So we are seeing our consumer doing very, very well. And I would point to a few data points on that. So over each one of our income demographics, we have seen growth, and we saw growth in this past quarter. We saw growth in our gold athletes, but every single income demographic. And what we're finding is that people are prioritizing health and wellness and active lifestyle team sports. And those are -- they're even more popular than they were before the pandemic, I think people really have decided with whatever they have in their wallet, they're prioritizing these categories. They're coming to life more as necessities rather than discretionary. Navdeep, I'll turn it to you to answer the question on our macro assumptions. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. In terms of the macro assumptions, we will continue to be mindful about what is happening in the macroeconomic landscape. But to your point, as you look at the guidance that we have provided, flat comp to plus 2%, we are very optimistic and confident about the guidance that we have provided. Just based on the differentiated assortment, the capabilities that we have as well as the number of athletes that we have acquired over the last several years here, we are confident in the guidance that we have provided. \nOperator: The next question comes from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: I just wanted to ask about the partnership with Nike. So you're over a year now into the loyalty program plug-in and they're presumably getting a much deeper level of customer data insight than they were before. And they've talked a lot about investing in the best strategic partners. Are there examples you can give on just how they've been using that data? Or any updates on how they're engaging with you as a partner? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Warren. Thank you. Our relationship with Nike is at an all-time high, and that's everything from insights that we are sharing, product information that we're sharing. And we're looking very long term at the state of the consumer and each category and working at a very strategic level. We've been very pleased with how the connected membership has gone. We have over 1 million members now who have opted to link both their Nike and their DICK'S loyalty accounts. And because of that, we're able to get much better insights into our athletes, how they're shopping, where they're shopping and how we can continue to innovate in that partnership. We're very excited about some of the things coming down the pike with that connected membership in terms of omnichannel experiences that we're going to offer that we haven't gotten into yet. But overall, the Nike partnership is a tremendous -- just a wonderful partnership for us. \nWarren Cheng: Great. And my follow-up, just a clarification on some of the comments you made earlier about the House of Sport roll-up or rollout. Is that actually going to be margin accretive or margin neutral? Or is that -- does that take time to scale before that happens? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. So Warren, just a couple of comments before we get into the specifics. So we are very confident about the House of Sport strategy. The 3 stores that we have opened, it's a handful of stores, but the results both on the top line and the bottom line that we are seeing are really, really great. And that's what gives us the confidence that we have. In terms of the impact of these things, that will be recognized over time, as you can imagine, over the next 2 years, we intend to open about 20 and like Lauren said in our prepared comments over the next 5 years, it could be 75 to 100. So the benefit will be seen over time, but we are very optimistic about the strategy and the differentiation as well as the ability it provides us to engage with the athlete in a very differentiated way. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: I'm curious if you can give an update on Going, Going, Gone!. How many did you end the year with? How many are pop-ups versus permanent? And anything you could share in terms of what that added to sales in F '22? And what's the plan for F '23? \nNavdeep Gupta: So Paul, in terms of the Going, Going, Gone! on stores, like as we call them permanent, there were 15 of them that we had at the end of the year. We had more warehouse plus those are kind of the 43 temporary locations as we call them, really, really enthusiastic about the strategy, not only is it allowing us to engage with an athlete and a different profile of an athlete than a DICK's Sporting Goods athlete. So that's one benefit. In addition, as we have talked about the benefit that this provides in terms of being able to liquidate our inventory and actually get a better recovery rate on that inventory is also a strong asset for us. \nLauren Hobart: Paul, I would just add one thing. I think the way we look at the Going, Going, Gone! chain is that it's a flexible asset. So we can expand, and we've done that with our temporary pop-up locations. We can take those down if we don't need them or if they're not working. So by the time something becomes a Going, Going, Gone! concept, it's been proven and tested, but the warehouse strategy is very flexible. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then could you just maybe just get a little bit of a further breakdown of CapEx investments for '23? Just how much of that is at the store level, both new and existing stores versus IT and corporate. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Paul, look the vast majority of the expend or the capital investment will be going into stores as we called out, right? We -- our plan is to open 9 new House of Sport locations as well as to the earlier capital investment into the 2024 House of Sport openings. In addition, as we indicated, we'll be upgrading hundred of our stores to premium full-service footwear DICK'S. There is definitely an investment on the backside in terms of the GameChanger technology, the investments that we are making in personalization as well as the other capability from data and analytics, all of that is also included in the guidance. But the vast majority of the investment will continue to be store facing. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Congrats on a great year. So how should we think about the new store productivity contribution from square footage growth? It looks like that -- the gap between comps and overall reported sales was close to 200 basis points this quarter, which would suggest any new store productivity has come online. It's been quite productive. So just curious as how should we model one new store productivity and overall square footage growth based on the number of stores you're talking to and also the bigger size of some of them. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. John, 2 different answers to that. First of all, if you look at Q4, the difference that you're seeing between the comp sales and the total sales growth, one, like you said, is driven by some of the new store openings. In addition, the temporary warehouse locations that we have, the warehouse plus stores, as we call them, they are not included in the comp numbers. So the sales that happened during the fourth quarter in those temporary locations are included in that.\n Coming back to your macro question, we do see a significant improvement in our sales productivity when we convert a store from the basic 50,000 store to a House of Sport location or even a comparable store to a House of Sport location. Considering that the majority of the stores that we have remodeled right now are relocations. So those will be in our comp expectation. They won't be as part of the new stores. And when we opened DICK'S House of Sport as a brand-new location, yes, they will definitely start to benefit our new store productivity metrics. \nOperator: Our final question today comes from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask about any merchandising changes you might be considering for 2023? Like are there any categories or certain trends or products that you might be leaning into or emphasizing a little bit more based on what you're seeing from the consumer? \nLauren Hobart: Joe, yes, we are still very focused on our 4 priority categories, footwear, team sports, athletic apparel and golf, we're always looking for new trends in new categories. But generally speaking, that's the 80% plus of our business, and that's where we're focused on driving growth. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. So not much newness coming, I guess, for some of those. What about -- sorry, yes. \nLauren Hobart: Sorry, Joe, I just want to -- I didn't say there wasn't any newness. There's a ton of newness coming. I just want to share with you that our priority categories of footwear, teams sports, apparel and golf are where we're focused. But there's certainly a ton of newness across the business. \nJoseph Feldman: Okay. I got it. Okay. Sorry for misunderstanding that. And then with regards to private label, maybe could you share just kind of the latest penetration and what you saw in the fourth quarter, I feel like you guys usually have shared a little more color there around how the consumer is opting for some of your brands. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Our vertical brands did tremendously well last year and in the quarter. We are really pleased with how the DSG brand is doing, opening price point brand, high function, high fashion as well as CALIA and VRST, which are filling white space in our portfolio. And even the Hagen brand doing incredibly well. So as we look to the end of the year, our overall vertical brand penetration for this past year was 14%. We had originally laid out a goal of about $2 billion a few years ago for vertical brands, and we finished about $1.7 billion very excited about both the sales and margin opportunity to go forward. As you know, vertical brands have 600 to 800 basis points of higher margin than our average. \nOperator: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have today for questions. I'll now turn the call back to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for any concluding remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you all for your time today and for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. We look forward to seeing you on the next call. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our 2022 results, which demonstrate the continued success strength of our business as we realize the benefits of our long-term transformation through focused strategies and strong execution. Our athletes are passionate about healthy active lifestyles and they've continued to prioritize sport and rely on DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet their needs. Importantly, we continued to gain market share at an accelerating pace with considerable growth in our largest and most important categories. Our fourth quarter was a strong ending to another strong year. This Q4, we achieved record quarterly sales of $3.6 billion, and our comps increased 5.3%.\n This strong comp was on top of a 6.6% comp last year, a 19.3% comp in 2020 and a 5.3% comp in 2019. And for this fourth quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.93, significantly ahead of any pre-COVID Q4 in our history. For the full year, we achieved sales of $12.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EBT margin was 11.4%, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $12.04. To put this in context, when you look at our 2022 performance versus 2019, our sales increased 41% or $3.6 billion.\n Our merchandise margin increased more than 300 basis points. Our non-GAAP EBT margin more than doubled and our non-GAAP EPS is more than 3x higher than 2019. Our strong performance and financial strength position us to increase the rate of investment in our business to fuel long-term growth opportunities and also return significant capital to shareholders. The step change increase in our dividend that we announced today, more than doubling our annualized payout to $4 per share or $1 on a quarterly basis, clearly reflects our strong conviction and a structurally higher sales and earnings profile of our business and our ongoing focus on delivering shareholder value.\n With 2023 marking our company's 75th anniversary, this is an incredibly exciting time for DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our company was founded in 1948 by Dick Stack with a dream and $300 from his grandmother's cookie jar. Under Ed's leadership, it's grown from a small bait-and-tackle shop to become the preeminent sporting goods retailer in the country. I've had the honor of working alongside Ed for over a decade and we will continue partnering to drive the business forward.\n While we will take the time to celebrate our heritage, we believe it's just as important to use this milestone as an opportunity to look forward. Our future is extremely bright, and we have great momentum as we write the next chapter in our growth story. Our 2022 results provide a strong foundation upon which we will build in 2023 and in the years ahead.\n In 2023, we will grow both our sales and earnings through positive comps, a return to square footage growth and higher merchandise margin. We expect our comparable store sales to be in the range of flat to positive 2%. We expect our earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.80, which at the midpoint is up 11% versus 2022.\n We will continue to create and define our future and as the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, we are well positioned to extend our lead and continue gaining share in a fragmented $140 billion industry. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for delivering another strong year and for their passion, hard work and dedication to our business.\n At DICK'S, it is our people who make us great. And none of what we would have accomplished -- none of what we have accomplished -- excuse me, would have been possible without our exceptional team.\n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results, outlook and capital allocation in more detail. Thanks, Navdeep. At DICK'S, we've been reinventing sports for 75 years. Over this time, we've grown significantly to become the largest omnichannel sports retailer in the U.S., a $140 billion industry, and the #1 premium golf and team sports destination in the world. We provide an unrivaled athletic apparel and footwear experience to our athletes. And we are the most important U.S. retail partner to many of the world's leading sports brands.\n Since 2017, we have transformed virtually every aspect of our business and have added $3.6 billion in sales over the last 3 years. We are well positioned to extend our leadership in a large fragmented industry and have never been more excited about the future of DICK'S. Within merchandising, we've built an industry-leading assortment known for differentiated and on-trend product. Our ability to showcase an entire brand portfolio is highly valued by our strategic partners, and our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever. We're also developing relationships with new and emerging brands, and at the same time, have created powerhouse vertical brands that collectively represent the second largest brand in our company.\n In our stores, we've invested in our teammate experience in training to heighten our team's ability to provide an enhanced level of service to our athletes, all while continuing to make DICK'S a fun and rewarding place to work. We believe strongly that highly engaged teammates are critical to providing a great experience for our athletes. And our culture is one of our key competitive advantages.\n In 2022, we were named one of Fortune's Best Workplaces in Retail. And just last month, we were named one of America's best large employers by Forbes. Along with enhanced service, we've leveraged distinct in-store elements powered by technology to provide an unparalleled athlete experience. Experiential in-store elements such as HitTrax batting cages, TrackMan golf simulators and premium full-service footwear decks, inspire confidence in our athletes and reinforce the power of our expertise.\n These strategies in combination with our personalized marketing engine and brand building efforts are working. We added 7 million new athletes during the year and reached record highs in our active athlete database in Q4. Our new athletes continue to skew younger and more female, representing a great opportunity for future growth. Importantly, our gold athletes, our most valuable cohort hit a record high of over 7 million people, equating to nearly 30% of our active scorecard members.\n We're seeing very strong retention with our gold athletes and they continue to drive meaningful sales growth, representing well over 40% of total sales. We've also launched new concepts such as Public Lands and Golf Galaxy Performance Center to better serve enthusiast outdoor athletes and golfers and recently announced that we will be acquiring leading outdoor retailer, Moosejaw, a reaffirmation of our commitment to growth in the multibillion-dollar outdoor category.\n However, there is no greater example of our commitment to innovation within the athlete experience than DICK'S House of Sport. DICK's House of Sport is redefining sports retail. It's an experiential destination that was inspired by Ed as he challenged us to create a concept that if built across the street from a DICK'S Sporting Goods store would put that store out of business.\n It's this way of thinking that drives us to continue to innovate and create market-leading disruption. House of Sport is an experience that fosters deep community involvement goes well beyond traditional retail and has become a destination where athletes can fuel their passions. Since launching House of Sport in 2021, our initial 3 locations have exceeded our expectations, driving strong engagement with our brand partners while delivering much higher total sales and profit as well as much higher sales and profit on a per square foot basis.\n House of Sport will be a significant part of our future growth story. Over the next 2 years, we plan to open around 20 additional locations, including Downtown Boston and our 2 hometowns of Pittsburgh and Binghamton, New York. And over the next 5 years, we could have as many as 75 to 100 House of Sport across the country. We are also continuing to pull key learnings into our core DICK'S fleet. In fact, later this year, we're excited to open the next-generation 50,000 square foot DICK'S store in South Bend, Indiana, which will reflect the House of Sport learnings for our athletes. For those who haven't yet had the chance to visit a House of Sport in person, which we highly recommend, we've added a short video to our Investor Relations website to help bring the experience to life.\n Across our ecosystem, we will continue to improve our omnichannel experience. For decades, we focused on making meaningful investments in technology with the long game in mind. Our athletes desired touch points have evolved significantly over the years, and we think about how to best meet their needs through a personalized experience enabled by technology and arguably the best data set in sports.\n We continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes who spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. We're excited by the results these investments are generating and believe our capabilities are distinctive in our industry and provide a long-term competitive advantage. As we expand our leadership position in youth sports, GameChanger plays a pivotal role.\n GameChanger is the premier scoring and statistics mobile app for youth sports and is a leader in the multibillion-dollar sports technology market. As a recurring revenue Software-as-a-Service company. GameChanger has delivered 5-year revenue CAGR of 35%, while also being profitable, a function of its business model, which delivers some of the best unit economics in consumer technology. With GameChanger, we are connecting youth athletes to their teammates, coaches and families through score-keeping and live streaming, all on one easy-to-use mobile app.\n Over the past 2 years, our GameChanger team transformed its user experience to incorporate video streaming highlights and 8 [ new ] sports, all delivered to athletes and their families on their phones and tablets anywhere they are. Every year, nearly 6 million games are covered on GameChanger and athletes and their families engaged with the platform for over 280 million hours. To put this in perspective, more games are covered in a single spring month on GameChanger than have been played in the entire history of Major League Baseball. We were honored to see GameChanger named to Fast Company's list of the World's Most Innovative Companies for 2023 and also be named as a finalist for the Sports Business Journal Tech awards that will be held later today. Looking ahead, we will continue innovating within youth sports technology and strengthening this important connection with athletes.\n Lastly, we have big plans for our brand in 2023. Over the years, our brand marketing has inspired athletes to participate in sports and our Sports Matter program has made it possible for more youth athletes to experience the unique and life-altering benefits that youth sports provide. We believe it's time to blend the inspiration and aspiration that's always been a part of our brand marketing efforts with the raw power and emotion of our Sports Matter initiative.\n To make that happen, we're really pleased to share that we will be relaunching our brand during the upcoming NCAA tournament with a campaign focused on the power of sports to change lives. We are so proud of the great work our team has done. And if you're watching the tournament, men's or women's, I promise you will not miss it.\n In addition, we're combining this with a commitment from our foundation of more than $5 million to fund 75 youth sports organizations, each with a $75,000 grant to keep kids playing.\n In closing, we want to reiterate that our strong Q4 and 2022 performance is the direct result of our strategies, our agility in meeting the evolving needs of our athletes and our relentless drive to innovate all supported by outstanding execution from our team. Since 1948, DICK'S has believed in the power of sports to change lives, and we are committed to bringing this belief to life through our athlete experience, brand engagement, differentiated product and, most importantly, our people.\n These are the pillars of the new foundation of growth for our business, and we believe that no one is better positioned to lead in the marketplace. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across our stores, distribution centers and customer support center for their outstanding efforts and continued commitment to our business.\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Simeon, yes, our fiscal '22 level of merch margin is indeed a new baseline. We are planning to grow our merch margin going forward. I'll turn to Navdeep to answer the breakdown of where we think that will come from next year. Thanks, Simeon. You're absolutely right that our product mix and our assortment is a key driver of our growth, and it's been a driver of our growth in our transformation, and it will be going forward. we believe there has been a structural change in our business over the last 5 years. First of all, we've seen a shift in consumer behavior where they are prioritizing athletic endeavor sports, health and active -- heath and -- healthy excuse me, and active lifestyle, and they're prioritizing DICK'S in order to meet those needs. But as you mentioned, we've also completely revamped our athlete experience. So we've got omnichannel capabilities that people are leaning into. We've got a great service model that we continue to focus on. And we brought in experiences such as HitTrax and TrackMan into our overall experience so that people can really feel confident in the goods that they're buying.\n And then lastly, our ability to showcase a brand from head to toe and to really put a brand forward and the best light possible has become a big advantage. So our distribution, our access to products, the fact that we now have products all the way from opening price point up to what the enthusiast will desire to meet their needs on the field is absolutely part of our ongoing strategy. We're very confident in that growth. Thanks, Adrienne. You're absolutely correct that we are leaning into new store growth and specifically due to the experience we've had with House of Sport, the fact that the 3 experiences that we built as really concept stores have become scalable, highly profitable, more sales, more profit, both on a total basis as well as a square footage basis, we are leaning into that growth. And so we will have 9 that are being built this year from remodels and one relocation as well as 10 in the pipeline for 2024 that we're already going to start construction this year. we're very, very bullish on House of Sport and what this can do for our athlete experience in our business. Navdeep? Thanks, Robby. I'll start off. The cadence of comps in fiscal '23, you're correct. That we will expect -- we do expect comps to be stronger in the first half than the second half. As you think back to last year at this time, Q1 and Q2, we had significant inventory challenges. That's the whole reason why the inventory came in late as the year went on. And it was difficult to put together a really fantastic athlete experience. At this point, our spring product is in. I would actually encourage you to go to a DICK'S store and take a look. We have a fantastic assortment.\n And so due to the comps from last year and the confidence we have in our business, we do expect comps to be very strong in the first half. As you look towards the back half of the year, we're just being cautious. We're up against a 6% comp, and we want to reflect that the comps will moderate. I'll turn it -- I will turn it over to Navdeep to break down some of your further questions. But I do want to start by saying your question about transaction size, I think you have to start with the fact that transactions were up 7.6%.\n So while there was a slight decline in average ticket and we don't break out whether that's AUR, UPT, we did find that there were more athletes, so we have more athletes in our database. They shopped more frequently. And in total, they spent more. So delivering a 5.3% comp with that level of transaction size, we're really, really pleased with that. Kate, I just want to pick up one other part of your question. You asked whether we're lapping severe inventory issues or promotions. I want to be very clear that while we managed through a lot of inventory disruptions last year, there was no return to an overall promotional environment. We cleared due inventory through our value chain stores, through our Going, Going, Gone! chain, and we were able to keep the DICK'S store really looking great for holiday with an assortment of full-price merchandise. And that really was true throughout the entire year. So promotions, I just want to pick up on the -- story that comes up all the time, promotions were not a key factor in our year, last year. There was price item discounts, especially on lumps, but it wasn't a highly promotional environment for us. Yes. Thanks, Chris. We have been talking in 2019 just due to all of the ups and downs of the past few years, but we will not be doing that going forward. And '22 is the new base from which we're going to grow. We're going to grow the top line and bottom line. And yes, it is our hope that this year, finally, there is some normalized seasonal cadence just because with the inventory challenges for last year and the impact that had on consumer shopping behavior as well as some of the issues people are having with inflation. All of that will -- we're hoping will normalize this year so that we can continue to plan from this going forward.\n Important point and related to what I was just saying to Kate, our promotions did not elevate our comp trends in the second half. In fact, most of the inventory liquidation that we had happened in our value chain and in our warehouse stores, which don't affect our comp, our comp was driven by transactions, 7.6% increase in transactions. Go ahead, Navdeep. It's not likely to be material. Sure. Yes. I mean if you think about our priority categories of footwear, athletic apparel, team sports, footwear in our premium full-service footwear decks, we are making a larger investment in those, as you heard in our prepared remarks because it does allow us to have a full assortment, which does really delight the athlete and enable us to drive strong comps. Beyond that, we're not going to break down how it was -- how we did in Q4 by various categories. But generally speaking, our assortment was really strong and drove the comp. Yes. Thanks, Brian. So DICK'S is -- I can't say it's not affected by any promotions outside of our company, but our assortment is so narrowly distributed now and just differentiated that we don't spend a lot of time looking at an outside promotional environment. We have an extensive database of 150 million people. We can manage on a personalized basis what pricing we want to offer, and we are very much more focused on strategic investments in price item where necessary to move our business. Yes. Thanks. So we are seeing our consumer doing very, very well. And I would point to a few data points on that. So over each one of our income demographics, we have seen growth, and we saw growth in this past quarter. We saw growth in our gold athletes, but every single income demographic. And what we're finding is that people are prioritizing health and wellness and active lifestyle team sports. And those are -- they're even more popular than they were before the pandemic, I think people really have decided with whatever they have in their wallet, they're prioritizing these categories. They're coming to life more as necessities rather than discretionary. Navdeep, I'll turn it to you to answer the question on our macro assumptions. Yes, Warren. Thank you. Our relationship with Nike is at an all-time high, and that's everything from insights that we are sharing, product information that we're sharing. And we're looking very long term at the state of the consumer and each category and working at a very strategic level. We've been very pleased with how the connected membership has gone. We have over 1 million members now who have opted to link both their Nike and their DICK'S loyalty accounts. And because of that, we're able to get much better insights into our athletes, how they're shopping, where they're shopping and how we can continue to innovate in that partnership. We're very excited about some of the things coming down the pike with that connected membership in terms of omnichannel experiences that we're going to offer that we haven't gotten into yet. But overall, the Nike partnership is a tremendous -- just a wonderful partnership for us. Paul, I would just add one thing. I think the way we look at the Going, Going, Gone! chain is that it's a flexible asset. So we can expand, and we've done that with our temporary pop-up locations. We can take those down if we don't need them or if they're not working. So by the time something becomes a Going, Going, Gone! concept, it's been proven and tested, but the warehouse strategy is very flexible. Joe, yes, we are still very focused on our 4 priority categories, footwear, team sports, athletic apparel and golf, we're always looking for new trends in new categories. But generally speaking, that's the 80% plus of our business, and that's where we're focused on driving growth. Sorry, Joe, I just want to -- I didn't say there wasn't any newness. There's a ton of newness coming. I just want to share with you that our priority categories of footwear, teams sports, apparel and golf are where we're focused. But there's certainly a ton of newness across the business. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Our vertical brands did tremendously well last year and in the quarter. We are really pleased with how the DSG brand is doing, opening price point brand, high function, high fashion as well as CALIA and VRST, which are filling white space in our portfolio. And even the Hagen brand doing incredibly well. So as we look to the end of the year, our overall vertical brand penetration for this past year was 14%. We had originally laid out a goal of about $2 billion a few years ago for vertical brands, and we finished about $1.7 billion very excited about both the sales and margin opportunity to go forward. As you know, vertical brands have 600 to 800 basis points of higher margin than our average. Thank you all for your time today and for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. We look forward to seeing you on the next call. Thank you."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our full year 2022 results. Consolidated sales increased 0.6% to a record-setting $12.37 billion and the comparable store sales decreased 0.5%. When compared to 2019, sales increased 41.3% or $3.62 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our structurally higher sales compared to pre-COVID levels.\n Importantly, if you look at some of the slides that we have inserted in our investor deck, you will see that approximately 80% of our growth was driven by sales in our priority categories of footwear, athletic apparel, team sports and golf, where we gained considerable market share. These gains are the direct results of our differentiated product, enhanced service and elevated experience we provide to our athletes.\n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit for the full year was $4.29 billion or 34.65% of net sales and declined 368 basis points from last year. However, our gross profit increased 531 basis points over 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. As expected, the year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 303 basis points. When compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate was up 308 basis points, it's important to highlight that we maintain the majority of the merchandise margin expansion that we drove over the prior 2 years. We also saw a significant leverage of 306 basis points in occupancy cost due to our structurally higher sales.\n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $2.78 billion or 22.45% of net sales and deleveraged 78 basis points from last year. SG&A dollars increased $112 million, primarily due to investments in hourly wage rates, talent and technology to support our growth strategy. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. When compared to 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A leveraged 178 basis points due to the significant sales increase.\n Interest expense was $95.2 million, an increase of $68.2 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $52.8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current year also included $23.3 million of inducement charges that were partially offset by cash interest savings both related to our exchange of approximately $516 million, a principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, non-GAAP EBT was $1.41 billion or 11.43% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $440.5 million or 5.03% of net sales in 2019, an increase of close to $1 billion, or 640 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\n The additional slides that we have included in our investor deck highlight the key drivers of our structurally higher profitability today versus pre-COVID. These include significant leverage of fixed costs due to our structurally higher sales base, a structurally higher merchandise margin due to our differentiated product assortment, more granular pricing management and the merchandising mix benefits and the improved e-commerce profitability, which is now in line with the total company EBT margin.\n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.04. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $15.70 last year and is more than 3x our 2019 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5 -- of sorry, $3.69.\n Now moving to our Q4 results. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.3% to $3.6 billion. This was the largest sales quarter in the history of DICK'S Sporting Goods. Comparable store sales increased 5.3% on top of a 6.6% increase in the same period last year and 19.3% increase in Q4 of 2020 and a 5.3% increase in Q4 of 2019.\n Our strong comps were driven by a 7.6% increase in transactions, partially offset by a 2.3% decline in average ticket. Within our portfolio, our priority categories did very well, driven by our differentiated assortment across footwear, athletic apparel and team sports. When compared to 2019, sales increased 37.9% or $988.1 million.\n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.17 billion or 32.44% of net sales and declined 514 basis points versus last year. However, our gross profit increased 384 basis points over Q4 of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 640 basis points and partially offset by lower supply chain costs.\n As planned, during the holiday season, we provided our athletes with a series of compelling item level deals. Additionally, we continue to address targeted inventory overages due to the late arriving Sprint product. As a result of these actions, our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We are taking in new receipts and could not be more excited about our spring assortment. Importantly, when compared to 2019, Q4 '22 margin rate is 209 basis points higher, driven by a differentiated assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategy and a favorable product mix. These are the same key contributors to our structurally higher margins that we have been emphasizing.\n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $823.7 million or 22.9% of net sales and leveraged 48 basis points compared to last year. Interest expense was $18 million, an increase of $9.2 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $11.4 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion senior notes issued in January of fiscal '21.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, non-GAAP EBT was $350.5 million or 9.74% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $148.6 million or 5.7% of net sales in 2019, an increase of $201.9 million or [ 404 ] basis points as a percentage of net sales. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.93. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.64 last year and represents a 122% increase over 2019's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32.\n As Lauren said, we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us, particularly in our core business with DICK's House of Sport. As a result, we plan to convert our 17 existing Field & Stream stores, the majority of which are part of DICK'S Field & Stream combo store to DICK's House of Sport or larger format DICK's stores and exit the Field & Stream brand.\n We closed 12 of these stores during Q4, and we plan to convert the remaining stores by 2024. As a result, in Q4, we incurred pretax charges totaling $30.1 million, primarily noncash impairments of Field & Stream store assets. These charges, along with certain items related to our convertible senior notes were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60. For additional details on this, you can refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, with no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Quarter inventory levels increased 23% compared to Q4 of last year. As a reminder, we were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the more useful comparison is against 2019. Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned.\n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $89.8 million, and we paid $39.3 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased approximately 610,000 shares of our stock for $66 million at an average price of $107.53. Furthermore, following the exchange of approximately $95 million of the outstanding principle of our convertible senior notes, we gave notice in February to the convertible noteholders that the remaining $59 million will be redeemed in shares for the total principal plus the accrued interest. We expect these notes to be fully paid off by April 18.\n Now let me move to our 2023 outlook, which will be for 53-week year. Coming off of 2 consecutive record years in 2020 and 2021, our 2022 results provide a strong foundation upon which we will build in 2023 and in the years ahead. Let's review the details. Comparable store sales are expected to be in the range of flat to positive 2%, with comps expected to be stronger in the first half due to improved inventory availability.\n At the midpoint, EBT margin is expected to be approximately 11.7%, driven by increase in gross margins. This includes an expected improvement in merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs. Q1 gross margin is expected to meaningfully improve versus Q4, but be modestly down year-over-year primarily due to lower merchandise margins partially offset by improving freight expenses.\n We expect both gross margins and merchandise margins to sequentially improve through the year. SG&A expenses are expected to deleverage primarily due to investments to fund our growth strategy. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $55 million, which is down approximately $40 million year-over-year due to the inducement charges that we incurred throughout 2022 as we repurchase our convertible debt and related interest savings.\n In total, we anticipate earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.80, which includes approximately $0.20 coming from the 53rd week. At the midpoint of this range, EPS is up 11% versus 2022 or up 5% (sic) [ 9% ]on a 52-week comparable basis. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, which is driven by a favorable rate impact on the vesting of employee equity awards in the first quarter.\n I'll conclude with a brief discussion around capital allocation priorities. Investing in our business drive profitable organic growth remains our top priority. We also remain committed to returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. In fact, over the past 2 years, we have returned nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders, which included approximately $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $766 million of dividend, all while continuing to invest in the profitable growth of our business. Where appropriate, we will pursue acquisitions to amplify our growth and add new capabilities for the future. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to a healthy balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.\n For 2023, our capital allocation plan includes capital expenditures of $550 million to $600 million. We will make significant investments to grow our business and drive athlete engagement. And as Lauren said, we are excited to return to growing our square footage. DICK'S House of Sport will be the primary driver of the square footage growth. In 2023, we will open 9 new DICK'S House of Sport locations, 8 of which are existing DICK'S and Field & Stream combo store conversions, along with 1 relocation.\n We will also begin construction on more than 10 new DICK'S House of Sport locations that will open throughout 2024. In 2023, we will grow the footprint of our Golf Galaxy business through Golf Galaxy Performance Center and convert temporary value chain stores to permanent locations. In addition, we will convert over additional 100 stores to premium full-service footwear, taking this elevated athlete experience to over 75% of our DICK'S locations.\n In terms of returning capital to shareholders, today, we announced a considerable increase in our dividends of 105% to an annualized payout of $4 per share or $1 on a quarterly basis. This dividend increase is based on our confidence in our structurally higher sales and earnings profile and reflects our conviction in our strategies and future growth trajectory.\n In addition, our 2023 plan includes our expectation of $300 million of share repurchases to offset dilution. The effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. However, we will consider using our excess cash flow to opportunistically repurchase shares beyond the $300 million.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to Lauren to review some of the key initiatives that will propel our profitable long-term growth. Simeon, as we articulated in our guidance, we expect the profitability of the business to improve next year, driven by both growth in our merchandise margin and gross margin. And as we talked about it, we are very optimistic about continuing to grow our top line and profitability on the long-term basis as well. Adrienne, great question. I think maybe there is 2 ways to answer this. First of all, like we have said 2022 is the new baseline foundation upon which we will grow our sales and earnings over the long term. As also Lauren noted, as we look to the future, we still believe there is a tremendous amount of share gain opportunity for us. We are the largest sporting goods company. And right now, our share in $140 billion industry is just 8%. So as we look to the future, that is we are very optimistic about the opportunity that we have to continue to provide differentiated assortment and service to our athletes and continue to gain share. I'm not willing to give today a long-term rubric, but here's the way to think about it, that we believe we can continue to drive positive comps, continue to grow our square footage and continue to expand our profitability into the future. And we are very optimistic, as you can see based on the guidance that we have provided that for 2023. Robby, I think Lauren covered that answered really well. Maybe another way to think about this is if you look at our -- the same transaction and ticket versus 2019, we saw much balanced performance. So that maybe is another way to think about that. And then as you look to the guidance overall, we are remaining very optimistic and confident about the guidance that we have provided here for 2023. Kate, this is Navdeep. So we gave 2 color commentary around the gross margin expectation. First, that we expect that the merch margin and gross margins will improve into 2023, 2 drivers merch margin as well as the lower freight expenses that we will start to see the benefit into 2023 as well. In terms of a little bit of more cadence around gross -- merch margin itself, as you can imagine, the inventory positions in Q1, both for us as well as the -- in the industry was pretty lean and was pretty constrained. So as we are annualizing that, we expect some level of normalization of the pricing in the first half and that's what we gave in our kind of a cadence for the merch margin expansion. And as you think about the back half, we also expect the freight expenses to start to have the benefit as the inventory starts to turn because we capitalize those expenses. So that's the other factor that we have contemplated in our guidance. Mike, Moosejaw is not included in our guidance as the transaction has not yet closed. So we will include that commentary in our next quarter's outlook. That's a great question, Mike. I think it will all depend on what do we do with the excess cash as we have also included in our guidance that we will continue to remain opportunistic with our share buyback. So depending on what we do with the share buyback, that will have an impact on the interest income. But you rightfully said, with the current interest environment that we have, we are able to get a good yield on our excess cash on the balance sheet. Michael, let's make sure we understand your question currently because maybe I'll begin with the middle part of your question. You indicated that the transportation cost was a benefit in 2022. Actually, that is not the case because we recognize the freight expenses over the turn of the inventory. So by the time we started to see the early benefits of the freight expenses by the time it rolls through, we actually will start to see the benefit in the second half of 2023.\n And in terms of the guidance, that's kind of the first part of your question, what we said about both the sales and the profitability and we're not indicating to the gross margins. We're talking about the overall profitability of the company is the new baseline. So we are very confident in the guidance that we gave that we will improve both the merch margin and gross profit into 2023 over where we finished 2022. Yes. I'll take the first part, and I'll turn to Lauren for the second one. In terms of over time, like we have said, there is nothing structurally that is holding us back from achieving that level of profitability that we delivered in 2021. So over time, Michael, your comment is appropriate. And maybe Lauren, you can take the second one. Yes. In terms of the macro assumptions, we will continue to be mindful about what is happening in the macroeconomic landscape. But to your point, as you look at the guidance that we have provided, flat comp to plus 2%, we are very optimistic and confident about the guidance that we have provided. Just based on the differentiated assortment, the capabilities that we have as well as the number of athletes that we have acquired over the last several years here, we are confident in the guidance that we have provided. Yes. So Warren, just a couple of comments before we get into the specifics. So we are very confident about the House of Sport strategy. The 3 stores that we have opened, it's a handful of stores, but the results both on the top line and the bottom line that we are seeing are really, really great. And that's what gives us the confidence that we have. In terms of the impact of these things, that will be recognized over time, as you can imagine, over the next 2 years, we intend to open about 20 and like Lauren said in our prepared comments over the next 5 years, it could be 75 to 100. So the benefit will be seen over time, but we are very optimistic about the strategy and the differentiation as well as the ability it provides us to engage with the athlete in a very differentiated way. So Paul, in terms of the Going, Going, Gone! on stores, like as we call them permanent, there were 15 of them that we had at the end of the year. We had more warehouse plus those are kind of the 43 temporary locations as we call them, really, really enthusiastic about the strategy, not only is it allowing us to engage with an athlete and a different profile of an athlete than a DICK's Sporting Goods athlete. So that's one benefit. In addition, as we have talked about the benefit that this provides in terms of being able to liquidate our inventory and actually get a better recovery rate on that inventory is also a strong asset for us. Yes. Paul, look the vast majority of the expend or the capital investment will be going into stores as we called out, right? We -- our plan is to open 9 new House of Sport locations as well as to the earlier capital investment into the 2024 House of Sport openings. In addition, as we indicated, we'll be upgrading hundred of our stores to premium full-service footwear DICK'S. There is definitely an investment on the backside in terms of the GameChanger technology, the investments that we are making in personalization as well as the other capability from data and analytics, all of that is also included in the guidance. But the vast majority of the investment will continue to be store facing. Yes. John, 2 different answers to that. First of all, if you look at Q4, the difference that you're seeing between the comp sales and the total sales growth, one, like you said, is driven by some of the new store openings. In addition, the temporary warehouse locations that we have, the warehouse plus stores, as we call them, they are not included in the comp numbers. So the sales that happened during the fourth quarter in those temporary locations are included in that.\n Coming back to your macro question, we do see a significant improvement in our sales productivity when we convert a store from the basic 50,000 store to a House of Sport location or even a comparable store to a House of Sport location. Considering that the majority of the stores that we have remodeled right now are relocations. So those will be in our comp expectation. They won't be as part of the new stores. And when we opened DICK'S House of Sport as a brand-new location, yes, they will definitely start to benefit our new store productivity metrics."

[Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the call over to our host, Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Nate. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2022 results. On today's call will be Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.\n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.\n During this morning's call, we will discuss earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, which eliminates the impact of certain items related to our convertible senior notes issued in Q1 2020. For additional details on this or to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures referenced on today's call. Please refer to our Investor Relations website. And finally, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our fourth quarter 2022 earnings results on March 7, 2023.\n So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter. Our Q3 results demonstrate the continued success and strength of our business based on our transformational journey and the foundational improvements we've made over the past 5 years. Our strategies are working and are clearly resonating with our athletes.\n While consumers continue to face macroeconomic uncertainties, our athletes have held up very well as we continue to offer them a compelling and differentiated assortment as well as a best-in-class omnichannel experience. In fact, during the quarter, we saw three important consumer trends.\n More athletes purchased from us, they purchased more frequently and they spent more each trip compared to the same period last year. Our industry has strong momentum given a lasting shift in consumer behavior and our differentiated assortment, elevated service standards and best-in-class omnichannel athlete experience are setting us apart in the marketplace.\n This Q3, we achieved record sales of $2.96 billion and our comps increased 6.5%, driven by increases in both transactions and average ticket. This strong comp was on top of a 13% comp last year, a 23% comp in 2020 and a 6% comp in 2019. As you've heard us say many times, DICK'S is a growth company, and our Q3 results are powerful evidence of our sustainable growth story.\n As we indicated on our last call, at the end of Q2, our inventory position was strong, and we were back in stock in key items. This enabled us to deliver a very strong back-to-school season and meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, we also mentioned that we have pockets of apparel inventory to address and we have addressed much of that overage this quarter. As a result, and as expected, we saw a merchandise margin decline of 438 basis points versus last year.\n Importantly, our merchandise margin remained elevated compared to 2019. And looking ahead, we continue to be very confident that our merchandise margin will remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n We achieved double-digit EBT margin of 10.3% in the quarter, over 3x our 2019 rate on a non-GAAP basis. This was driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margins and greater operating efficiency. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60, significantly ahead of any pre-COVID third quarter in our history.\n Looking ahead, our inventory is healthy and well-positioned, and we're excited about the assortment that we have in place for the holiday season. Because of our continued strong performance, quality of inventory and the confidence we have in our business, we're raising our full year outlook. We now expect comparable store sales for the year to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 1.5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.10.\n In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods, which helped make this performance possible and for their upcoming efforts during the holiday season.\n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial outlook and results in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results.\n We are excited to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.7% to $2.96 billion. As Lauren noted, comparable store sales increased 6.5% on top of a 12.8% increase in the same period last year, a 23.2% increase in Q3 of 2020 and a 6% increase in Q3 of 2019. Our strong comps were driven by a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 2.8% increase in average ticket.\n Within our portfolio, the back-to-school categories did very well, driven by our differentiated assortment across footwear, apparel and team sports. When compared to 2019, sales increased 51%. This reflects a significant sequential acceleration in our sales trends versus 2019 from recent quarters.\n Gross profit in the third quarter was $1.01 billion or 34.22% of net sales and declined 423 basis points versus last year. However, it increased 463 basis points over Q3 of 2019. As expected, the year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 438 basis points.\n During the quarter, we focused on cleaning up some targeted inventory overages due to late arriving spring products. We moved excess apparel inventory to our value chain concept and have been very successful in liquidating much of this product. We intend to continue addressing this overage in Q4 in order to start 2023 clean.\n Our Q4 merchandise margin expectations are appropriately reflected within our annual outlook. Compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate is 141 basis points higher driven by a differentiated assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and a favorable product mix. Because of these structural drivers, we continue to expect our merchandise margin rate to remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n SG&A expenses were $679.7 million or 22.97% of net sales and leveraged 3 basis points compared to last year on the increase in net sales. The $48 million increase in SG&A dollars was driven by investments in hourly wage rates, talent and technology to support our growth strategies.\n Interest expense was $26.1 million, an increase of $20.1 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $13.8 million of interest expense related to our $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current quarter also included $8.8 million of inducement charges related to our exchange of approximately $221 million of outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by a structurally higher sales, expanded margins and operating efficiency compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $304.1 million or 10.28% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $59.9 million or 3.05% of net sales in 2019 and an increase of $244.2 million or 723 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.19 last year and represents a 400% increase over 2019's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter end inventory levels increased 35% compared to Q3 of last year. As a reminder, we were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the better comparison is against Q3 of 2019. And compared to Q3 2019, our 51% increase in sales was well ahead of our 31% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned.\n Now turning to our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were approximately $100 million and we paid $41 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged approximately $221 million of outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of the convertible note hedge and warrants or 4.3 million shares of our common stock. After completing this exchange, we have taken out approximately $421 million with approximately $154 million in aggregate principal of the convertible notes still outstanding.\n Beyond retiring nearly 3/4 of our convertible notes, year-to-date, we have returned $485 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the profitable growth of our business.\n So let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and the quality of our assortment for the holiday season, we are raising our 2022 guidance. Importantly, our updated outlook continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. For the year, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of negative 3% to negative 1.5% compared to our prior expectation of negative 6% to negative 2%.\n In addition, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $11.50 to $12.10 compared to our prior expectation of $10 and $12. EBT margin is now expected to be approximately 11.4% at the midpoint, more than double our 2019 rate. Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of about 25% and is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results, and we remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on merch margin or gross margin. I think you've been saying that we expect to retain, I think, a majority of the COVID gains. I wanted to ask if that's still the case. And I guess the fact that you're getting through this period relatively well where your vendors have excess inventory, does that build your confidence around that forecast of being able to retain a majority of this gross margin? \nLauren Hobart: Simeon, thank you. Yes, we still believe that we will be able to retain a significant amount of our merch margin gains. This particular quarter, if you look back at Q2, we had indicated that we had gotten a lot of late receipts in from spring that came in on top of our back-to-school inventory, and we were heavy in apparel, and we aggressively took care of that this quarter to clean up our inventory so that we could maintain -- so we've taken holiday merchandise and start 2023 clean.\n So we absolutely believe in the structural changes in our overall margin. I would point to the fact that our EBT margin, even with that investment that we made to clean up apparel, it was 10.3%. So over 3x what it was pre-2019, we have tremendous confidence in the long-term sustainability of our profitability. \nSimeon Gutman: And then my follow-up is on sales. Some of the categories or the overall business, either normalizing at a higher level or just performing better than maybe the market would have thought, if you look back a couple of years. You're prepared to talk about '23, but can you just talk about some of the categories where there's been some reversion. Has that stabilized and rebounded? Does the business digest or can the business keep growing next year? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So the categories in Q3 that our core categories are the ones that we are the most focused on. So team sports, apparel, footwear, all key back-to-school categories and our top categories, and they performed extremely well. If you look across every single one of our key categories, everything except hunt, which is not a key category anymore, we have meaningfully rebaselined versus pre-COVID levels. We see no reason why long term, we should not be able to continue to grow from this level. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations to the team on this stellar execution as always. So Lauren, I guess my first question is going to be on the promo environment. Is it only apparel? It sounds like you've actually made your way through that. Are you seeing any kind of spillage -- spill over into safe footwear? And how much vendor support are you getting for those promos? How long do you think that lasts? And then for Navdeep, clearly, you're buying for spring of next year. So you had that buildup of safety stock in transit, whatever you want to call it, but how are you thinking about unit buys, excluding, right, outside of that in-transit inventory. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. So we work very closely with our vendor partners, as always, to make sure that the inventory in the marketplace is at the levels that we all want it to be. We continue to move product when it needs to be moved, and that's in every category. Apparel was an issue this past quarter, and we will be aggressive to clean up whatever needs to be cleaned up in Q4 in partnership with our vendor partners. Our main priority right now is to start 2023 clean, and we're really thrilled that we have in stock for Q4 inventory for the first time in a few years that's going to be robust and that people will be able to find exactly what they're looking for with great holiday gifts. Navdeep? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Adrienne, thanks. For 2023, I'm not going to be able to provide any early guidance. But as Lauren indicated, we are very confident about the core aspects of the business as you think about apparel, footwear, team sports and even the outdoor category. So we are appropriately being cautious about -- with the macroeconomic outlook. But overall, we are very confident about the sales expectations on a long-term basis. And we'll provide our 2023 outlook as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: My question is on the basket uplift that you guys saw in the third quarter, do you -- should we look for that to continue into the fourth quarter? Maybe more color on what is driving the increase in the average transaction size? Is it better in-stock levels and the high ticket items? Or is it because you were out of stock last year? Like more of the dynamic on what's driving that would be helpful. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So our comps this year -- this quarter was really strong, driven by more than -- 50% was driven by transactions and the rest by basket. And within the basket, there was some impact of inflation and passing some costs along to consumers, some of which we absorbed ourselves. But there was also a shift in terms of the mix that we provide to consumers and some premiumization of what people are buying. Consumers are absolutely signaling that a healthy active outdoor lifestyle is important to them, and they are buying what they're considering discretionary items to keep that lifestyle going. So it was really across the entire basket. Things were improved. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Robby, maybe I'll add one more comment. Each of our the consumer income demographic that we have within our store did really, really well in third quarter. And what we saw was that highly engaged and loyal athletes that we have in our gold customer. Those customers actually did even better. And so we continue to be really optimistic when we look at the core aspects of the business about the fourth quarter. We are balancing that against the macroeconomic constraints that we see right now. But overall, we were very pleased with the results that we saw in Q3. \nRobert Ohmes: And maybe just a quick follow-up. Can you remind us how holiday played out last year in terms of pull-forward of spending and how you're planning against that this year for the fourth quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. We probably, Robby, saw a little bit pretty much like every retailer that there was a little bit of early start to the season, both last year and if you look in 2020 as well because of the overall constrained inventory levels that were existing. And -- but however, as we look to the business, we look at it as the overall holiday season. So not too focused on the first few weeks or late October. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I'm just trying to reconcile what one of your vendors said with regards to the amount of inventory that they had in transit. And I wondered if there was any risk of further late deliveries over the next quarter or two that you might have to manage as a result? \nLauren Hobart: Kate, thank you. Yes, we are working very closely with our vendor partners. We've got a great flow of product right now, and everything has been factored into our guidance, which we're feeling really, really good about. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Maybe you could frame for us the amount of excess inventory that you had to clear through in 3Q, how that compares to what you think you have to clear through in 4Q. Any help you can provide on the merchandise margin side. And I guess just related to the clearance, I'm curious if as you picked up the promotional cadence, if you saw a lift in sales? Was it a traffic and sales driver during the quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Paul, I think there are two questions there. In terms of the quantification of the clearance inventory, I would say it was not a material portion of our driver of the sales in the third quarter. What we saw and like Lauren alluded to, we saw the gain in our comp sales come more from the transaction growth and the AUR increase. And AUR increase also came from kind of the high heat and the highly allocated assortment that we have.\n In terms of the potential markdown risk for fourth quarter, much of the inventory that had been moved into clearance was activated and quickly moved through in third quarter. There is some pockets of inventory here in fourth quarter, which we will continue to address. However, all of that has been contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance. And with this guidance that we have given, we are very confident that we'll be able to maintain a meaningful gain in our merch margins compared to 2019. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can you dig in a little bit on the gross margin side? The 438 basis points, does that include the mix benefit if footwear and apparel did really well relative to other categories? And then as you think about the freight line, how are you thinking about freight costs? Were they still a pressure year-over-year? Is there any sort of capitalized inventory costs that will flow through on a delayed basis as we look over the coming quarters? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Chris, in terms of the mix, there was probably a small benefit, but it wasn't material to call that out, and that's the reason it was not included. In terms of the freight costs, yes, we are seeing that the freight costs have continued to come down and have come down since the beginning of this year, but still not down versus -- when you compare it to 2019. \n In terms of the flow of the product, yes, it will take some time that cost will -- or the benefit of this reduced cost will be realized into 2023. \nChristopher Horvers: And then as a follow-up, you mentioned trying to be prudent and conservative around the guidance in the fourth quarter. You are degrading your sort of 3-year CAGR growth relative to 2019. I guess, can you talk about what informs that point of view? I know there's some normalized and seasonality that's occurring as we speak sort of end of October through November, are you extrapolating the sort of the current trend of the business to arrive at the implied 4Q comp? Or are you -- is there -- what degree of conservatism is baked in? \nLauren Hobart: Chris, we feel incredibly good about the momentum in our business coming out of a very strong Q3. I would point out, we had three really strong months in Q3. And coming into Q4, we see absolutely no signs of any degradation. We're very enthusiastic about Q4. We are being appropriately cautious just because of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the fact that the consumer is going through a lot right now, but our confidence is as high as it's been. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: So just a follow-up on a previous question on how much inventory is left to clear. The -- I think your fourth quarter EBT margin guidance is down 260 basis points. That would be the smallest decline over the year and better than what you saw in the third quarter. Is that because you're now mostly through the markdowns? Or if not, why is the EBT margins decline expected to be better in the fourth quarter than the previous quarters? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Mike, I won't guide specifically to fourth quarter, I'm sure you can back into it. I would say there are structurally things are expected to improve as we go into the fourth quarter. Like we said, much of the clearance activity that we were activating in third quarter is behind us. So that's one reason. The other reason is just because we feel confident about our ability to manage our expenses as well as drive higher productivity. \nMichael Baker: Makes sense. If I could ask one more follow-up, a mundane question, but the interest expense and everything that's going in that line with all the converted stuff, it's been about $25 million, $26 million each of the three quarters this year. On a non-GAAP basis, can you just help us any reason why that should be different? I know there's a lot of moving pieces with the convert there. So just wondering if you can help us with that line. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. You are spot on in terms of the onetime costs associated with the convert, it's over $20 million when you look at it on a year-to-date basis. So if you do decide to execute another tranche of the convertible note transaction in fourth quarter, that headwind was not contemplated in our guidance. But we will continue to look on the convert and take that out in fourth quarter on an opportunistic basis. \nOperator: Our next question is from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: Great execution this quarter. Sorry to keep hammering on this merchandise margin question, but I think it's just really important to understand the dynamics here. So if I just look relative to 2019 levels, it looks like the merchandise margins degraded about 300 basis points from second quarter to third. Can you just give us a little bit better sense of how much of that came from that apparel clearance maybe so we can understand what merchandise margin would look like excluding this issue with the late spring receipts. \nNavdeep Gupta: Warren, the vast majority of the decline that we saw here in third quarter came from the activation that we had around the apparel overages that Lauren indicated at the end of Q2. \nWarren Cheng: Got it. Okay. And my follow-up is just any color on the process of clearing these inventories. I know a lot more is running through your own clearance concepts, your own value chain concepts. Can you just give us a sense of the margin uplift when it runs through your own content versus the old way through your own mainline stores? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. We've had great success with our value chain concepts, both ongoing on and our warehouse stores. We do see that we can optimize our margin on our clearance better. We also have great success when we clear products online, but it also enables us to bring product -- fresh product into the DICK'S stores, which also helps us drive margin. Navdeep, I don't think we're going to answer specifically. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, I would say that we are very pleased with the strategy that we have of leveraging the Going, Going, Gone! concept as well as the warehouse locations. Like Lauren indicated the recovery on this on this product from a clearance perspective is significantly better than what we used to have in 2019. And we have called out that as one of the key structural drivers of our confidence of us being able to maintain a meaningful portion of the margin gains compared to 2019. \nOperator: The next question today comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So the message that you're offering this morning is that the margin degradation that you experienced in the third quarter is transitory in nature because it's associated with having excess inventory that presumably will be cleared out by the end of the fourth quarter, and you will now have this moving into next year. Now next year, you might experience a softer overall demand environment such that you will have to increase your promotional activity to work harder to driving customers and this will offset some of the benefit next year that you'll have from cleaner inventory. Is that the right way to think about it? \nLauren Hobart: Partly, Michael, but not all, no. The margin degradation, we expect to be clean going into next year. So correct that these were investments that we made to get our inventory clean and we'll continue to do that. We're not guiding to next year, but I would just point to the fact that we've had significant athlete growth. We've had growth in the number of athletes, over 16.5 million new athletes in the last 2 years and this year-to-date, 4.5 million new athletes joining, and they are driving transactions and our gold customers are growing. So I would not say that we're expecting at this point in time, any sort of an overall demand change that would require a heavy promotional environment. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Michael, and I'll add one more you have called out. One of the -- yes. One of the structural drivers that we have talked about in merch margin continuing to remain significantly elevated is the assortment that we now have in our stores. And that assortment is highly allocated, high heat and typically not impacted by the promotional activity that might be happening. So that's another factor that gives us tremendous amount of confidence as we look to 2023. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is objectively, DICK's is going to put up one of the strongest results across retail and within sporting this retail in the quarter. Presumably, some of that is related to the unique content that DICK'S has, where it's got a great assortment of footwear, there's a footwear cycle going on. And that's drawing in a lot of the traffic. This is happening at a time where back-to-school was good in part because kids hadn't been in school or known to be -- weren't going to know to be in school ahead of time for the last few years. So is there anything unique given those set of circumstances that is -- you would hold responsible for driving demand that may not persist into next year, especially at a time where the overall consumer environment is likely going to soften. \nLauren Hobart: Michael, you have essentially just laid out what I would say is our transformational journey over the past few years where we have really changed the allocation of products that we have, what we're offering to consumers. We've got higher heat and more differentiated products. And at the same time, we've been working on our omnichannel athlete experience of elevating service in the stores, elevating our digital experience, elevating -- having a product available close to the consumer when and where they want it. So there's nothing unique about how we drove demand that won't persist into next year.\n The back-to-school season happens to be a showcase of our very strongest categories in footwear, apparel and team sports. But nothing unique about this quarter that shouldn't persist. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Congrats on nice quarter. Just on inventory. $3.3 billion on the balance sheet in Q3. Some of that's obviously just from higher cost, but how should we think about the growth of inventory year-over-year in Q4 where you think you might finish? And what you think inventory levels look like in the spring of '23? \nNavdeep Gupta: John, just let's deep -- go a little bit deeper into the Q3 results in terms of the inventory. And as we called out, it's much better to look at inventory growth versus 2019 as we were chasing our inventory all of last year, including fourth quarter with plenty of product remaining in transit as we were getting ready for the holiday season. So when you look at the growth in our inventory in third quarter, our sales grew versus 2019, 51% and our inventory grew 31%. And we'll continue to manage the inventory the same way. We want to make sure that there is right availability and in-stock available for the athletes for the important holiday season. And there are pockets of inventory, like we have said, we will actively work on that in the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel our inventory is healthy and is very well-positioned for the holiday season. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. And then maybe one quick follow-up as it relates to supply chain costs. Obviously everybody can see that some of the inbound freight costs have come down pretty significantly. How do we think about some of the domestic freight and shipping costs as we go into Q4 and next year? \nNavdeep Gupta: You meant Q4 of this year? \nJohn Kernan: Yes. \nNavdeep Gupta: Okay. \nJohn Kernan: How do we think about -- I think. \nNavdeep Gupta: No, that's helpful. No, we agree with you on the international freight side that definitely there is a continued lowering of the costs that we have seen, probably I would call it from third quarter onwards. And However, the domestic side still continues to be volatile, and we are working very closely with our vendor partners as well as our supply chain team works very closely with the domestic partners as well. That still continues to be volatile. We are playing close attention to it. But right now, our focus is to make sure that the inventory is available in stores and available for athlete to buy as they are looking for good opportunities here for the holiday season. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nWilliam Dossett: This is William Dossett on for Brian Nagel. Congrats on a nice quarter. So our question is actually just on product mix over time, how you're balancing between your national accounts and your vertical brands? And can you provide an update on the performance in the quarter for your private label brands and how this customer is behaving? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Our vertical brands continue to do very well and outperformed for this year in Q3. The DSG brand, in particular, has done incredibly well. It's a high fashion, high-function product at a very attractive price point. It's perfect for the consumer right now. And at the same time, CALIA and VRST are filling white space in our assortment and really leaning toward that athletic male, athletic female and more of a performance and lifestyle brands. So we're very, very pleased with the vertical brands.\n The last time we gave an update that we do it annually, and it was 14% was our vertical brand penetration. So we'll update that again at the end of this year, yes. \nWilliam Dossett: Okay. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up, do you see any variability across geographies and across other product spectrums? \nLauren Hobart: Nothing meaningful in the quarter, no. \nOperator: The next question today comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. \nSamuel Poser: A bunch of them have been answered, but I have a few more. What was your -- or your e-commerce penetration or e-commerce sales for the quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Sam, we no longer break that out. As we think about the athlete, we look at the athlete on an omnichannel basis because the athlete is making the channel agnostic decision, and that's the way we want to operate our business. So we no longer are giving that breakout. Actually, that's been going on since the beginning of this year. \nSamuel Poser: Okay. I missed that... \nNavdeep Gupta: Maybe I'll add that. We were very, very happy with the overall performance that we saw across both channels. \nSamuel Poser: So let me just follow up. Okay. So back to inventory, what is your forward weeks of supply -- optimum forward weeks of supply with what you're seeing right now or optimum annual turn target that would be -- because it's up from pre-COVID. It's turning a little slower than pre-COVID. But what's -- so how should we think about sort of what it should be on an optimum basis? Should you be having like 14 or 15 forward weeks of supply or you -- should you be running at 17 or 18? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Sam, we haven't given that level of guidance, but the way to think about this is as we are comparing our inventory growth and sales growth compared to 2019 because that is probably the last time we had some normalized level of inventory. So probably that's the easiest and the best comparison right now you could do. \nSamuel Poser: Okay. And then the loyalty members make up how much of your business these days? \nLauren Hobart: It's over 70% of our business. But importantly, we've got over 25 million loyalty members, over 32 million active members, both outside of our loyalty and within and then over 150 million athletes who are in our database overall. So they comprise a... \nSamuel Poser: Okay. And then lastly, there's a lot of questions asked about the macro. But my question for you is about what you guys have done and about the long-term growth of the business. Where are you in the continuum of improving the levels of engagement, the personalization process and so on to overcome the macro because I wouldn't call it necessarily a direct competitor, but another athletic retailer reported, you put up significantly better numbers. We're going to hear from somebody else next week. Can you talk about your -- the use of your CRM and how everything is evolving and sort of the reason why from the perspective of what you're doing that the business is rebasing over and can grow from here? \nLauren Hobart: Great question. Yes, it's a great question because our database and our knowledge of our athletes is at an all-time high, and we continue to have, what I would say, is the best data set in sports, and I'm not the only person saying that. We have an amazing data set. We are more personalized than ever before. We're driving engagement, both online and also, I would say, in our stores in terms of how we serve athletes, so we're very focused on the athlete experience. But at the same time, I would say we're in early innings. So I think we've got a long way to go with personalization. We continue to gain new athletes. We're very focused on -- using that CRM database to provide people with the best experience for them. And that's, I think, early innings still for a lot of this despite how far along we've come. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. \nSteven Forbes: I wanted to revisit the acceleration in transaction trends, really, if we look at it on a 3-year basis, it was a meaningful sequential improvement. So curious if you could just expand on what drove that, if it had anything to do with new athletes that were acquired. You mentioned 4 million, but is that 4 million more heavily weighted to the third quarter? Really just trying to get any insight on the sustainability of the step-up in transactions on a multiyear trend. \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Steven, thank you for the question. So we -- our growth in transaction came from several important trends. First of all, we did have new athletes come in. So I mentioned 4.5 million year-to-date, 1.5 million of those were in the past quarter. So it's been fairly consistent throughout the year. But they are also driving increased transactions and increased dollars per transaction. \n And I think it's important to dive into how our consumers are doing and how they're responding to our industry in our stores. But every single one of our income demographic levels has grown meaningfully in the past quarter. So it's clear that we are providing something for everybody in terms of -- so we can meet their needs and still deliver that outdoor lifestyle. We are not seeing people trade down. So between our athlete database growing, our increased personalization efforts, which will continue into next year, we expect that, that will be a key driver for us going forward. \nSteven Forbes: Maybe just a quick follow-up on Navdeep, obviously, right, you sort of a net share issuer with the settlement and unwind of the convertible note hedges and so forth. So would love to just maybe if you can expand on the decision to pause the repurchase activity last quarter. Any current updates on capital allocation as we look forward here over the NTM? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. No, let me start with your second question first. So as we think about capital allocation, we continue to have a really strong balance sheet with more -- with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition to that, maintaining the investment grade is an important part of the criteria as we think about the capital structure. And then we are continuing to invest aggressively in our business and the growth opportunities that we have.\n To your question on a year-to-date basis, we have returned $485 million of excess cash on the balance sheet between the share repurchases, which we guided at the beginning of the year, a minimum of 300. We have already eclipsed that. And in this quarter, we focused on taking out the converts. So we took out $221 million of convert. How deep the convert is in the money, it trades pretty much like an equity. And like you said, it's -- we are taking that potential future dilution as the stock price continues to rise by taking the convert out right now.\n So overall, we'll continue to be flexible in our capital allocation in terms of buying more shares back and we'll be opportunistic as we look to the share buyback for the balance of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask about the layout in the store, at least a couple of local stores around me, it feels like you've done some things to adjust the layout. Maybe emphasizing private brands a bit more, the vertical brands, I should say, more front and center and in fact, even replacing where you used to keep the big brands, the national brands. And I'm just curious if that's something you're testing and what you're learning from that test? And is that something we should expect to see in more stores in the future? \nLauren Hobart: Joe, I think what you're picking up on is that we have adopted a very flexible approach to how we lay out products based on in-stocks, based on what's hot with the consumer at the moment. And so -- no longer are the days where you're going to walk into a DICK'S store and see everything laid out the same way. We are constantly optimizing. We do space optimization frequently and move things around as needed. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. And then just wanted to get an update on maybe House of Sport and Public Lands, just latest learnings and expansion plans for those two concepts? \nLauren Hobart: House of Sport has been absolutely tremendous, both in terms of how the locations themselves are doing. They far exceeded our expectations. But also in terms of what we're able to take from House of Sport and bring down to the rest of our chain in terms of service levels and products and even -- we have some new products that have launched there that have done really well the rest of the chain. So really, really excited about House of Sport.\n Public Lands also equally really excited about. We have just launched, I think, five new Public Lands stores about in the past month. They are meant to tap into a very broad outdoor consumer, and they are doing an incredible job serving those explorers very well. So we're very excited. Public Lands, still in test phase. House of Sport support definitely a key part of our roll forward strategies. \nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: I'm sorry to parse words, and maybe this is just a nuance, but regarding the merchandise margin improvement that you've seen since 2019, you're indicating now that you expect to retain a significant amount or a meaningful amount of it versus previously expecting to retain a majority of it. Is that accurate? \nNavdeep Gupta: Seth, I would say we are still guiding that we will maintain a meaningful portion of that margin gain. So again, maybe I'll recap some of the structural reasons that we are seeing, and we have that confidence. If you look at Q3, the performance that we saw in Q3 from the highly-allocated product is what drove a significant amount of our success in third quarter. And to me, that's kind of a go-forward strategy, and that will be a continued benefit that we will keep.\n The tools that we have, whether it is Going, Going, Gone! or the promotional and the pricing capabilities that we have delivered is something that is really, really strong compared to where it was in 2019. And that, again, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence. \n And then the product mix, I know there was a question on vertical brands. The vertical brands have 600 to 800 basis points of higher margin. And these brands, again, resonated really well in third quarter. And the hunt penetration, that used to have almost about 1,700 basis points lower margin, and that has become a meaningfully small piece of our business. When you look back at all of these structural drivers, and you look at the performance that we delivered in Q3, that's what gives us the tremendous amount of confidence that we can maintain a meaningful portion of these gains versus 2019. \nSeth Basham: That's helpful. But just to clarify, you don't expect to necessarily maintain majority anymore, just a meaningful amount? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Yes, you can parse the words, but we are very confident that we'll maintain a meaningful portion of those gains versus 2019. \nLauren Hobart: I think -- just to add on this, it's important to look at our full year results. We've been talking about full year and we absolutely expect to maintain a significantly meaningful amount of our margin improvements. \nSeth Basham: Wonderful. And just as a follow-up question regarding the promotional environment outside of apparel, how would you characterize that relative to pre-pandemic levels and your expectations into the holiday season? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Our approach to the holiday season is very different from how it was prepandemic. We are being much more surgical. We're making sure we have great gifts for people at great value but no longer are we doing whole household sites on sale, that sort of a sledgehammer approach to promotion. We're being much more targeted, much more item focused and much more surgical. We're really excited about the in-stock levels that we have and that our approach to holiday is going to be very well-received by athletes. \nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Kleber with Baird. \nJustin Kleber: Just wanted to ask a follow-up on merch margins. Given your comments on largely working through the apparel inventory here in 3Q, do you expect your merchandise margin declines to moderate in 4Q based on the guidance? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Justin, I would say it's been implied in our annual outlook. When you look at the merch margin, there are a couple of factors you have to keep in mind. Comparing to 2019, we definitely feel very confident that we'll maintain a meaningful portion of those gains as we go into the fourth quarter. And then you have to look into the commentary that we gave in fourth quarter around the promotional landscape last year compared to where our expectation that Lauren just laid out.\n Overall, on an annual basis, like we have said, we'll maintain a meaningful portion of the gains versus 2019. \nJustin Kleber: Okay. Maybe a follow-up, Navdeep, on just SG&A flexibility. Your sales based on the guidance are going to be up to 38.5% at the midpoint. Looks like SG&A will have leveraged maybe around 150 basis points versus '19. So clearly, you've been reinvesting some of the top line upside into SG&A in the past few years, whether that's marketing or wages. I guess my question is in the event demand does soften, how much flexibility do you have within your SG&A structure to maintain EBT margins at this level without of course sacrificing service levels in the store? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Justin, I think that you've read the SG&A profile really well. We agree that we are investing in the long-term growth strategies of the company. In addition, the wage pressures continue to remain elevated compared to 2019. So those are the big areas of investment in SG&A as you look to this year.\n In terms of the forward-looking view, first of all, the variable expense is always flexible sales. So if the sales are volatile for whatever reason, we believe that our variable expenses will definitely reflect. In addition, we have flexibility in our fixed as well as the discretionary expenses as well. And as you called out, we will balance these actions with what is the right thing to do for the long-term aspect of the business versus keeping the company in really healthy conditions. And we could look also at our growth strategies and the investments required. So internally, we feel really confident that we will be able to navigate macroeconomic conditions really well and drive the long-term sales growth and the profitability growth of the company. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. \nJim Duffy: I have a few questions about the warehouse store strategy. We have about 50 locations. So it looks like temporary locations. Is that how you think about this? Or is that a permanent part of the strategy? And I'm curious how that fits with the Going, Going, Gone! concepts? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Great question, Jim. The way we're thinking about the value change in general, is that we have a try before you buy strategy where we do a pop up, and that's what you're seeing at the DICK's warehouse stores. See how the consumer reacts, see how we like the real estate and then a portion of those are converted into a Going, Going, Gone! permanent location. So that will be our ongoing strategy. We find a great deal of success trying before we actually sign a long-term lease. \nJim Duffy: Got it. And then a question around the inventory in those stores, the footprints for the ones I've seen are large. Are you opportunistically buying to populate these stores? Or is there inventory in these stores simply accessed from regular way business. And I'm also curious, is that inventory in the outlet store strategy, is that visible and shoppable online? Or are those kind of brick-and-mortar silos? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. They are shoppable online. In fact, they really help us by consolidating all of the clearance inventory into one location. We can easily find it and light it up online, not worrying about safety stocks and things like that. So that's a key part of it.\n We do buy a little bit opportunistically for the Going, Going, Gone! and warehouse stores. But by and large, they are primarily clearance channels for DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our main goal is to clear that product so that we can bring fresh new receipts into DICK'S. \nOperator: Our last question today comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. \nDaniel Imbro: I wanted to ask one, Lauren, on the consumer. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any trade down yet. But just as the consumer weakens, are there levers you can pull other than price to kind of increase the value offering DICK'S has to retain that customer? And then just as you think about the box, what categories would you expect to slow first? Or where would be the times of weakness you're looking for to get a sense of the health of the consumer? \nLauren Hobart: Daniel, the way we approach the assortment is that we want to have something for everyone. We are not seeing people trade down, but we do offer a range of opening price points, fantastic apparel and gear all the way up to the most premium. So I mean, sort of there's levers we can pull. Our scorecard engagement is really high. That's a great tool for us. It enables us to get personalized message out to our athletes. But across the board, we're not seeing -- I can't predict because I don't see any slowdown in any of our key categories. They're all healthy. \nDaniel Imbro: That's helpful. And then I think just to dig in on the inventory a little more detail or asked a different way. Is your inventory equally strong or healthy across maybe vertical brands and national brands? Or are you more exposed? Just thinking about if there was a trade down, could you get stuck with more national brand inventory that maybe the consumer is opting out of? Or how is your inventory held across the different kind of subsets of inventory? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Overall, I would say our inventory is very healthy and very well-positioned for the holiday season. The only lump that we called out was on the athletic apparel side and we are -- much of that has been already activated here in third quarter, and we'll continue to work through that. But overall, like I said, we feel really strong about our in-stock levels going into this important holiday season. \nOperator: Those are all the questions we have for today. So I will now turn the call back to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for concluding remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I hope you have a happy, healthy and safe holiday. Bye-bye. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter. Our Q3 results demonstrate the continued success and strength of our business based on our transformational journey and the foundational improvements we've made over the past 5 years. Our strategies are working and are clearly resonating with our athletes.\n While consumers continue to face macroeconomic uncertainties, our athletes have held up very well as we continue to offer them a compelling and differentiated assortment as well as a best-in-class omnichannel experience. In fact, during the quarter, we saw three important consumer trends.\n More athletes purchased from us, they purchased more frequently and they spent more each trip compared to the same period last year. Our industry has strong momentum given a lasting shift in consumer behavior and our differentiated assortment, elevated service standards and best-in-class omnichannel athlete experience are setting us apart in the marketplace.\n This Q3, we achieved record sales of $2.96 billion and our comps increased 6.5%, driven by increases in both transactions and average ticket. This strong comp was on top of a 13% comp last year, a 23% comp in 2020 and a 6% comp in 2019. As you've heard us say many times, DICK'S is a growth company, and our Q3 results are powerful evidence of our sustainable growth story.\n As we indicated on our last call, at the end of Q2, our inventory position was strong, and we were back in stock in key items. This enabled us to deliver a very strong back-to-school season and meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, we also mentioned that we have pockets of apparel inventory to address and we have addressed much of that overage this quarter. As a result, and as expected, we saw a merchandise margin decline of 438 basis points versus last year.\n Importantly, our merchandise margin remained elevated compared to 2019. And looking ahead, we continue to be very confident that our merchandise margin will remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n We achieved double-digit EBT margin of 10.3% in the quarter, over 3x our 2019 rate on a non-GAAP basis. This was driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margins and greater operating efficiency. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60, significantly ahead of any pre-COVID third quarter in our history.\n Looking ahead, our inventory is healthy and well-positioned, and we're excited about the assortment that we have in place for the holiday season. Because of our continued strong performance, quality of inventory and the confidence we have in our business, we're raising our full year outlook. We now expect comparable store sales for the year to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 1.5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.10.\n In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods, which helped make this performance possible and for their upcoming efforts during the holiday season.\n I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial outlook and results in more detail. Simeon, thank you. Yes, we still believe that we will be able to retain a significant amount of our merch margin gains. This particular quarter, if you look back at Q2, we had indicated that we had gotten a lot of late receipts in from spring that came in on top of our back-to-school inventory, and we were heavy in apparel, and we aggressively took care of that this quarter to clean up our inventory so that we could maintain -- so we've taken holiday merchandise and start 2023 clean.\n So we absolutely believe in the structural changes in our overall margin. I would point to the fact that our EBT margin, even with that investment that we made to clean up apparel, it was 10.3%. So over 3x what it was pre-2019, we have tremendous confidence in the long-term sustainability of our profitability. Yes. So the categories in Q3 that our core categories are the ones that we are the most focused on. So team sports, apparel, footwear, all key back-to-school categories and our top categories, and they performed extremely well. If you look across every single one of our key categories, everything except hunt, which is not a key category anymore, we have meaningfully rebaselined versus pre-COVID levels. We see no reason why long term, we should not be able to continue to grow from this level. Thanks, Adrienne. So we work very closely with our vendor partners, as always, to make sure that the inventory in the marketplace is at the levels that we all want it to be. We continue to move product when it needs to be moved, and that's in every category. Apparel was an issue this past quarter, and we will be aggressive to clean up whatever needs to be cleaned up in Q4 in partnership with our vendor partners. Our main priority right now is to start 2023 clean, and we're really thrilled that we have in stock for Q4 inventory for the first time in a few years that's going to be robust and that people will be able to find exactly what they're looking for with great holiday gifts. Navdeep? Yes. So our comps this year -- this quarter was really strong, driven by more than -- 50% was driven by transactions and the rest by basket. And within the basket, there was some impact of inflation and passing some costs along to consumers, some of which we absorbed ourselves. But there was also a shift in terms of the mix that we provide to consumers and some premiumization of what people are buying. Consumers are absolutely signaling that a healthy active outdoor lifestyle is important to them, and they are buying what they're considering discretionary items to keep that lifestyle going. So it was really across the entire basket. Things were improved. Kate, thank you. Yes, we are working very closely with our vendor partners. We've got a great flow of product right now, and everything has been factored into our guidance, which we're feeling really, really good about. Chris, we feel incredibly good about the momentum in our business coming out of a very strong Q3. I would point out, we had three really strong months in Q3. And coming into Q4, we see absolutely no signs of any degradation. We're very enthusiastic about Q4. We are being appropriately cautious just because of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the fact that the consumer is going through a lot right now, but our confidence is as high as it's been. Yes. We've had great success with our value chain concepts, both ongoing on and our warehouse stores. We do see that we can optimize our margin on our clearance better. We also have great success when we clear products online, but it also enables us to bring product -- fresh product into the DICK'S stores, which also helps us drive margin. Navdeep, I don't think we're going to answer specifically. Partly, Michael, but not all, no. The margin degradation, we expect to be clean going into next year. So correct that these were investments that we made to get our inventory clean and we'll continue to do that. We're not guiding to next year, but I would just point to the fact that we've had significant athlete growth. We've had growth in the number of athletes, over 16.5 million new athletes in the last 2 years and this year-to-date, 4.5 million new athletes joining, and they are driving transactions and our gold customers are growing. So I would not say that we're expecting at this point in time, any sort of an overall demand change that would require a heavy promotional environment. Michael, you have essentially just laid out what I would say is our transformational journey over the past few years where we have really changed the allocation of products that we have, what we're offering to consumers. We've got higher heat and more differentiated products. And at the same time, we've been working on our omnichannel athlete experience of elevating service in the stores, elevating our digital experience, elevating -- having a product available close to the consumer when and where they want it. So there's nothing unique about how we drove demand that won't persist into next year.\n The back-to-school season happens to be a showcase of our very strongest categories in footwear, apparel and team sports. But nothing unique about this quarter that shouldn't persist. Yes. Our vertical brands continue to do very well and outperformed for this year in Q3. The DSG brand, in particular, has done incredibly well. It's a high fashion, high-function product at a very attractive price point. It's perfect for the consumer right now. And at the same time, CALIA and VRST are filling white space in our assortment and really leaning toward that athletic male, athletic female and more of a performance and lifestyle brands. So we're very, very pleased with the vertical brands.\n The last time we gave an update that we do it annually, and it was 14% was our vertical brand penetration. So we'll update that again at the end of this year, yes. Nothing meaningful in the quarter, no. It's over 70% of our business. But importantly, we've got over 25 million loyalty members, over 32 million active members, both outside of our loyalty and within and then over 150 million athletes who are in our database overall. So they comprise a... Great question. Yes, it's a great question because our database and our knowledge of our athletes is at an all-time high, and we continue to have, what I would say, is the best data set in sports, and I'm not the only person saying that. We have an amazing data set. We are more personalized than ever before. We're driving engagement, both online and also, I would say, in our stores in terms of how we serve athletes, so we're very focused on the athlete experience. But at the same time, I would say we're in early innings. So I think we've got a long way to go with personalization. We continue to gain new athletes. We're very focused on -- using that CRM database to provide people with the best experience for them. And that's, I think, early innings still for a lot of this despite how far along we've come. Yes, Steven, thank you for the question. So we -- our growth in transaction came from several important trends. First of all, we did have new athletes come in. So I mentioned 4.5 million year-to-date, 1.5 million of those were in the past quarter. So it's been fairly consistent throughout the year. But they are also driving increased transactions and increased dollars per transaction. \n And I think it's important to dive into how our consumers are doing and how they're responding to our industry in our stores. But every single one of our income demographic levels has grown meaningfully in the past quarter. So it's clear that we are providing something for everybody in terms of -- so we can meet their needs and still deliver that outdoor lifestyle. We are not seeing people trade down. So between our athlete database growing, our increased personalization efforts, which will continue into next year, we expect that, that will be a key driver for us going forward. Joe, I think what you're picking up on is that we have adopted a very flexible approach to how we lay out products based on in-stocks, based on what's hot with the consumer at the moment. And so -- no longer are the days where you're going to walk into a DICK'S store and see everything laid out the same way. We are constantly optimizing. We do space optimization frequently and move things around as needed. House of Sport has been absolutely tremendous, both in terms of how the locations themselves are doing. They far exceeded our expectations. But also in terms of what we're able to take from House of Sport and bring down to the rest of our chain in terms of service levels and products and even -- we have some new products that have launched there that have done really well the rest of the chain. So really, really excited about House of Sport.\n Public Lands also equally really excited about. We have just launched, I think, five new Public Lands stores about in the past month. They are meant to tap into a very broad outdoor consumer, and they are doing an incredible job serving those explorers very well. So we're very excited. Public Lands, still in test phase. House of Sport support definitely a key part of our roll forward strategies. I think -- just to add on this, it's important to look at our full year results. We've been talking about full year and we absolutely expect to maintain a significantly meaningful amount of our margin improvements. Yes. Our approach to the holiday season is very different from how it was prepandemic. We are being much more surgical. We're making sure we have great gifts for people at great value but no longer are we doing whole household sites on sale, that sort of a sledgehammer approach to promotion. We're being much more targeted, much more item focused and much more surgical. We're really excited about the in-stock levels that we have and that our approach to holiday is going to be very well-received by athletes. Yes. Great question, Jim. The way we're thinking about the value change in general, is that we have a try before you buy strategy where we do a pop up, and that's what you're seeing at the DICK's warehouse stores. See how the consumer reacts, see how we like the real estate and then a portion of those are converted into a Going, Going, Gone! permanent location. So that will be our ongoing strategy. We find a great deal of success trying before we actually sign a long-term lease. Yes. They are shoppable online. In fact, they really help us by consolidating all of the clearance inventory into one location. We can easily find it and light it up online, not worrying about safety stocks and things like that. So that's a key part of it.\n We do buy a little bit opportunistically for the Going, Going, Gone! and warehouse stores. But by and large, they are primarily clearance channels for DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our main goal is to clear that product so that we can bring fresh new receipts into DICK'S. Daniel, the way we approach the assortment is that we want to have something for everyone. We are not seeing people trade down, but we do offer a range of opening price points, fantastic apparel and gear all the way up to the most premium. So I mean, sort of there's levers we can pull. Our scorecard engagement is really high. That's a great tool for us. It enables us to get personalized message out to our athletes. But across the board, we're not seeing -- I can't predict because I don't see any slowdown in any of our key categories. They're all healthy. Thanks, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I hope you have a happy, healthy and safe holiday. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results.\n We are excited to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.7% to $2.96 billion. As Lauren noted, comparable store sales increased 6.5% on top of a 12.8% increase in the same period last year, a 23.2% increase in Q3 of 2020 and a 6% increase in Q3 of 2019. Our strong comps were driven by a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 2.8% increase in average ticket.\n Within our portfolio, the back-to-school categories did very well, driven by our differentiated assortment across footwear, apparel and team sports. When compared to 2019, sales increased 51%. This reflects a significant sequential acceleration in our sales trends versus 2019 from recent quarters.\n Gross profit in the third quarter was $1.01 billion or 34.22% of net sales and declined 423 basis points versus last year. However, it increased 463 basis points over Q3 of 2019. As expected, the year-over-year decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 438 basis points.\n During the quarter, we focused on cleaning up some targeted inventory overages due to late arriving spring products. We moved excess apparel inventory to our value chain concept and have been very successful in liquidating much of this product. We intend to continue addressing this overage in Q4 in order to start 2023 clean.\n Our Q4 merchandise margin expectations are appropriately reflected within our annual outlook. Compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate is 141 basis points higher driven by a differentiated assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and a favorable product mix. Because of these structural drivers, we continue to expect our merchandise margin rate to remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n SG&A expenses were $679.7 million or 22.97% of net sales and leveraged 3 basis points compared to last year on the increase in net sales. The $48 million increase in SG&A dollars was driven by investments in hourly wage rates, talent and technology to support our growth strategies.\n Interest expense was $26.1 million, an increase of $20.1 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $13.8 million of interest expense related to our $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current quarter also included $8.8 million of inducement charges related to our exchange of approximately $221 million of outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by a structurally higher sales, expanded margins and operating efficiency compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $304.1 million or 10.28% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $59.9 million or 3.05% of net sales in 2019 and an increase of $244.2 million or 723 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.19 last year and represents a 400% increase over 2019's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter end inventory levels increased 35% compared to Q3 of last year. As a reminder, we were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the better comparison is against Q3 of 2019. And compared to Q3 2019, our 51% increase in sales was well ahead of our 31% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned.\n Now turning to our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were approximately $100 million and we paid $41 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged approximately $221 million of outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of the convertible note hedge and warrants or 4.3 million shares of our common stock. After completing this exchange, we have taken out approximately $421 million with approximately $154 million in aggregate principal of the convertible notes still outstanding.\n Beyond retiring nearly 3/4 of our convertible notes, year-to-date, we have returned $485 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the profitable growth of our business.\n So let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and the quality of our assortment for the holiday season, we are raising our 2022 guidance. Importantly, our updated outlook continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. For the year, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of negative 3% to negative 1.5% compared to our prior expectation of negative 6% to negative 2%.\n In addition, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $11.50 to $12.10 compared to our prior expectation of $10 and $12. EBT margin is now expected to be approximately 11.4% at the midpoint, more than double our 2019 rate. Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of about 25% and is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results, and we remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yes, Adrienne, thanks. For 2023, I'm not going to be able to provide any early guidance. But as Lauren indicated, we are very confident about the core aspects of the business as you think about apparel, footwear, team sports and even the outdoor category. So we are appropriately being cautious about -- with the macroeconomic outlook. But overall, we are very confident about the sales expectations on a long-term basis. And we'll provide our 2023 outlook as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. Yes, Robby, maybe I'll add one more comment. Each of our the consumer income demographic that we have within our store did really, really well in third quarter. And what we saw was that highly engaged and loyal athletes that we have in our gold customer. Those customers actually did even better. And so we continue to be really optimistic when we look at the core aspects of the business about the fourth quarter. We are balancing that against the macroeconomic constraints that we see right now. But overall, we were very pleased with the results that we saw in Q3. Yes. We probably, Robby, saw a little bit pretty much like every retailer that there was a little bit of early start to the season, both last year and if you look in 2020 as well because of the overall constrained inventory levels that were existing. And -- but however, as we look to the business, we look at it as the overall holiday season. So not too focused on the first few weeks or late October. Paul, I think there are two questions there. In terms of the quantification of the clearance inventory, I would say it was not a material portion of our driver of the sales in the third quarter. What we saw and like Lauren alluded to, we saw the gain in our comp sales come more from the transaction growth and the AUR increase. And AUR increase also came from kind of the high heat and the highly allocated assortment that we have.\n In terms of the potential markdown risk for fourth quarter, much of the inventory that had been moved into clearance was activated and quickly moved through in third quarter. There is some pockets of inventory here in fourth quarter, which we will continue to address. However, all of that has been contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance. And with this guidance that we have given, we are very confident that we'll be able to maintain a meaningful gain in our merch margins compared to 2019. Yes, Chris, in terms of the mix, there was probably a small benefit, but it wasn't material to call that out, and that's the reason it was not included. In terms of the freight costs, yes, we are seeing that the freight costs have continued to come down and have come down since the beginning of this year, but still not down versus -- when you compare it to 2019. \n In terms of the flow of the product, yes, it will take some time that cost will -- or the benefit of this reduced cost will be realized into 2023. Yes, Mike, I won't guide specifically to fourth quarter, I'm sure you can back into it. I would say there are structurally things are expected to improve as we go into the fourth quarter. Like we said, much of the clearance activity that we were activating in third quarter is behind us. So that's one reason. The other reason is just because we feel confident about our ability to manage our expenses as well as drive higher productivity. Yes. You are spot on in terms of the onetime costs associated with the convert, it's over $20 million when you look at it on a year-to-date basis. So if you do decide to execute another tranche of the convertible note transaction in fourth quarter, that headwind was not contemplated in our guidance. But we will continue to look on the convert and take that out in fourth quarter on an opportunistic basis. Warren, the vast majority of the decline that we saw here in third quarter came from the activation that we had around the apparel overages that Lauren indicated at the end of Q2. Yes. Warren, I would say that we are very pleased with the strategy that we have of leveraging the Going, Going, Gone! concept as well as the warehouse locations. Like Lauren indicated the recovery on this on this product from a clearance perspective is significantly better than what we used to have in 2019. And we have called out that as one of the key structural drivers of our confidence of us being able to maintain a meaningful portion of the margin gains compared to 2019. Yes, Michael, and I'll add one more you have called out. One of the -- yes. One of the structural drivers that we have talked about in merch margin continuing to remain significantly elevated is the assortment that we now have in our stores. And that assortment is highly allocated, high heat and typically not impacted by the promotional activity that might be happening. So that's another factor that gives us tremendous amount of confidence as we look to 2023. John, just let's deep -- go a little bit deeper into the Q3 results in terms of the inventory. And as we called out, it's much better to look at inventory growth versus 2019 as we were chasing our inventory all of last year, including fourth quarter with plenty of product remaining in transit as we were getting ready for the holiday season. So when you look at the growth in our inventory in third quarter, our sales grew versus 2019, 51% and our inventory grew 31%. And we'll continue to manage the inventory the same way. We want to make sure that there is right availability and in-stock available for the athletes for the important holiday season. And there are pockets of inventory, like we have said, we will actively work on that in the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel our inventory is healthy and is very well-positioned for the holiday season. You meant Q4 of this year? Okay. No, that's helpful. No, we agree with you on the international freight side that definitely there is a continued lowering of the costs that we have seen, probably I would call it from third quarter onwards. And However, the domestic side still continues to be volatile, and we are working very closely with our vendor partners as well as our supply chain team works very closely with the domestic partners as well. That still continues to be volatile. We are playing close attention to it. But right now, our focus is to make sure that the inventory is available in stores and available for athlete to buy as they are looking for good opportunities here for the holiday season. Sam, we no longer break that out. As we think about the athlete, we look at the athlete on an omnichannel basis because the athlete is making the channel agnostic decision, and that's the way we want to operate our business. So we no longer are giving that breakout. Actually, that's been going on since the beginning of this year. Maybe I'll add that. We were very, very happy with the overall performance that we saw across both channels. Yes, Sam, we haven't given that level of guidance, but the way to think about this is as we are comparing our inventory growth and sales growth compared to 2019 because that is probably the last time we had some normalized level of inventory. So probably that's the easiest and the best comparison right now you could do. Yes. No, let me start with your second question first. So as we think about capital allocation, we continue to have a really strong balance sheet with more -- with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition to that, maintaining the investment grade is an important part of the criteria as we think about the capital structure. And then we are continuing to invest aggressively in our business and the growth opportunities that we have.\n To your question on a year-to-date basis, we have returned $485 million of excess cash on the balance sheet between the share repurchases, which we guided at the beginning of the year, a minimum of 300. We have already eclipsed that. And in this quarter, we focused on taking out the converts. So we took out $221 million of convert. How deep the convert is in the money, it trades pretty much like an equity. And like you said, it's -- we are taking that potential future dilution as the stock price continues to rise by taking the convert out right now.\n So overall, we'll continue to be flexible in our capital allocation in terms of buying more shares back and we'll be opportunistic as we look to the share buyback for the balance of this year. Seth, I would say we are still guiding that we will maintain a meaningful portion of that margin gain. So again, maybe I'll recap some of the structural reasons that we are seeing, and we have that confidence. If you look at Q3, the performance that we saw in Q3 from the highly-allocated product is what drove a significant amount of our success in third quarter. And to me, that's kind of a go-forward strategy, and that will be a continued benefit that we will keep.\n The tools that we have, whether it is Going, Going, Gone! or the promotional and the pricing capabilities that we have delivered is something that is really, really strong compared to where it was in 2019. And that, again, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence. \n And then the product mix, I know there was a question on vertical brands. The vertical brands have 600 to 800 basis points of higher margin. And these brands, again, resonated really well in third quarter. And the hunt penetration, that used to have almost about 1,700 basis points lower margin, and that has become a meaningfully small piece of our business. When you look back at all of these structural drivers, and you look at the performance that we delivered in Q3, that's what gives us the tremendous amount of confidence that we can maintain a meaningful portion of these gains versus 2019. Yes. Yes, you can parse the words, but we are very confident that we'll maintain a meaningful portion of those gains versus 2019. Yes. Justin, I would say it's been implied in our annual outlook. When you look at the merch margin, there are a couple of factors you have to keep in mind. Comparing to 2019, we definitely feel very confident that we'll maintain a meaningful portion of those gains as we go into the fourth quarter. And then you have to look into the commentary that we gave in fourth quarter around the promotional landscape last year compared to where our expectation that Lauren just laid out.\n Overall, on an annual basis, like we have said, we'll maintain a meaningful portion of the gains versus 2019. Yes. Justin, I think that you've read the SG&A profile really well. We agree that we are investing in the long-term growth strategies of the company. In addition, the wage pressures continue to remain elevated compared to 2019. So those are the big areas of investment in SG&A as you look to this year.\n In terms of the forward-looking view, first of all, the variable expense is always flexible sales. So if the sales are volatile for whatever reason, we believe that our variable expenses will definitely reflect. In addition, we have flexibility in our fixed as well as the discretionary expenses as well. And as you called out, we will balance these actions with what is the right thing to do for the long-term aspect of the business versus keeping the company in really healthy conditions. And we could look also at our growth strategies and the investments required. So internally, we feel really confident that we will be able to navigate macroeconomic conditions really well and drive the long-term sales growth and the profitability growth of the company. Yes. Overall, I would say our inventory is very healthy and very well-positioned for the holiday season. The only lump that we called out was on the athletic apparel side and we are -- much of that has been already activated here in third quarter, and we'll continue to work through that. But overall, like I said, we feel really strong about our in-stock levels going into this important holiday season."

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrate the strength of our core strategies and the foundational improvements we've made across our business over the past 5 years. In fact, we delivered approximately the same EBT in Q2 as we did in all of fiscal 2019.\n While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, the DICK's Sporting Goods consumer has held up quite well. Over the past 2 years, they've made lasting lifestyle changes focused on health and fitness, sports and outdoor activities, and we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on these secular trends.\n Our inventory is healthy and well positioned with improved in-stock levels in key categories. Importantly, we are raising our full year outlook, which continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution, given today's macroeconomic environment and contemplates an approximate 10.7% EBT margin at the midpoint.\n Now to our results. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered second quarter sales of $3.1 billion. This included a comparable store sales decline of 5.1% and, as expected, represented a sequential improvement from the first quarter. It's important to highlight that our sales continued to run substantially above pre-COVID levels, up 38% versus Q2 2019, reinforcing that the favorable shift in consumer behavior that I just mentioned is durable, and our actions to capitalize on this shift are yielding strong results.\n Notably, for the year, our key athlete success metrics, inclusive of acquisitions, new athlete retention, repeat purchasing and omnichannel behavior are elevated across the board compared to pre-COVID levels. Our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and favorable product mix, continue to drive strong merchandise margin. Our merchandise margin rate was up 439 basis points versus Q2 2019 as we maintained the majority of the merchandise margin expansion that we drove over the past 2 years.\n Before continuing, let me emphasize a critical point. The content of the product that we carry today is very different from the product that we carried 5 years ago. It's higher heat and more narrowly distributed than what you'll find in the marketplace and therefore, it is not as susceptible to promotions. In addition, the tools we have today to surgically adjust pricing and promotions are significantly more sophisticated than they were several years ago.\n Lastly, our product mix has structurally shifted towards higher-margin categories. We've materially reduced hunt exposure, which had margins approximately 1,700 basis points below the company average in 2019, and we continue to grow our vertical brands, which currently have margins between 600 to 800 basis points above the national brands.\n Looking ahead, we remain very confident that our merchandise margin will be meaningfully higher compared to pre-COVID levels on an annual basis, and that this improved profitability, is sustainable due to these foundational changes in our business. With our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margins and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, we achieved double-digit EBT margin of nearly 14%, approximately 2x our Q2 2019 EBT margin. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.68 in Q2 compared to $3.69 for the entire fiscal year of 2019.\n As we continue our transformational journey, we are focused on enhancing our existing strategies to further strengthen our core business and to drive long-term profitable growth. At the heart of these strategies is our athlete experience, and we continue to develop a highly engaging in-store service model to better serve our athletes. Our teammates are highly trained and are focused on creating confidence for our athletes by finding the best product for them.\n Our stores also now have highly experiential elements such as our premium full-service footwear decks, elevated soccer shops, golf simulators, HitTrax technology and batting cages. Our new DICK'S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center stores are tremendous examples of the power of elevated service models and experiential retail. These new concepts are redefining sports retail and providing us with valuable learnings while also driving strong sales and profitability.\n In addition, our digital experiences remain an integral part of our success, and we continue to prioritize investments in technology and in data science to elevate the athlete experience. We're focused on advancing our personalization capabilities and enhancing our one-to-one relationships with our athletes through our digital marketing, ensuring we serve them the most relevant products at the right time.\n Our personalization strategies are fueled by our robust and growing ScoreCard loyalty program and total athlete database. We now have over 25 million active ScoreCard loyalty members, a valuable cohort that has grown in recent years. And during the second quarter, our ScoreCard members generated well over 70% of our total sales, up approximately 200 basis points from the same period last year.\n Furthermore, our omnichannel platform, which features our stores as a hub, is an important competitive advantage for us. During the second quarter, our stores enabled over 90% of our total sales, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for omnichannel fulfillment.\n Next, within merchandising, our brand portfolio is a tremendous asset. And in fact, our data tells us that approximately 80% of our active athletes look to DICK'S for a multi-branded shopping experience. Importantly, our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever, and we are continuing to develop relationships with new and emerging brands. \n At the same time, we are creating and growing disruptive vertical brands like CALIA, VRST and DSG. Our assortment is on trend across categories, and we -- our wide range of price points ensures we are able to meet the needs of all athletes.\n Our teammates are our greatest assets, and we see our ability to attract and retain talent as a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for us. We're proud of our high teammate engagement levels, which reflect our efforts to be a great place to work. We'll continue to invest in our teammates and our enhanced service model to maintain our strong culture and drive a top-tier athlete experience.\n In closing, our strategies are working, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth. We're the clear market leader in a large fragmented industry, and we believe we are well positioned to continue taking market share and extending our lead. Through the macro -- though the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on meeting the current needs of our athletes.\n Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our second quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 5% to approximately $3.1 billion. When compared to 2019, sales increased 38%, demonstrating the sustainability of our structurally higher sales base compared to pre-COVID levels. Comparable store sales decreased 5.1% and, as expected, accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. As a reminder, we were lapping a 2-year stack comp increase of approximately 40% in Q2.\n Transactions declined 8.4% while the average ticket increased 3.3%. Within our portfolio, each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear performed generally in line with our expectations. Gross profit in the second quarter was $1.12 billion or 36.03% of net sales and declined 388 basis points versus last year. As expected, this decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 197 basis points, higher supply chain costs and deleverage on fixed occupancy costs from lower sales.\n Compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate expanded 439 basis points, driven by our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and favorable product mix. As Lauren mentioned, because of these structural drivers, we continue to expect our merchandise margin rate to be meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n SG&A expenses were $657.4 million or 21.12% of net sales and deleveraged 157 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to the decrease in sales. The increase in SG&A dollars was driven by our continued investment in hourly wage rates and talent to support our growth strategies.\n Interest expense was $25.5 million, an increase of $19.3 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 million of interest expense related to our $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current quarter also included $6.6 million of inducement charge related to our exchange of $100 million outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiency compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $427.3 million or 13.73% of net sales. This compares to EBT of $151 million or 6.69% of sales in the second quarter of 2019. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.68. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.08 last year and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.26 in 2019.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 49% compared to Q2 of last year. However, we were chasing inventory last year amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n A better comparison is against Q2 of 2019, where our 40% increase in inventory was relatively in line with our 38% increase in sales. As Lauren said, our inventory is healthy and well positioned. We are excited about the assortment we have in place for the important back-to-school season, and we are prepared to continue navigating a dynamic global supply chain environment through the rest of the year.\n Turning to our second quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $84.5 million, and we paid $36.9 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged $100 million or approximately 21% of then-outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of the convertible note hedge and warrants for 1.7 million shares of our common stock. Following this exchange, we have $375 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.9 million shares of our stock for $319 million at an average price of $80.84.\n Now let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and continue to deliver meaningful sales and profitability growth over 2019. As a result of our Q2 performance and improved inventory position for the important back-to-school season, we are raising our 2022 guidance. Importantly, as Lauren indicated, our updated outlook continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution, given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic backdrop, geopolitical environment, and the dynamic global supply chain.\n For the year, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of negative 6% to negative 2% compared to our prior expectation between negative 8% to negative 2%. In addition, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $10 to $12 compared to our prior expectation of $9.15 to $11.70.\n While our outlook is not dependent upon share repurchases beyond the $361 million executed through the end of Q2, we will continue to be opportunistic as the year progresses. EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.7% at the midpoint, more than double our 2019 rate. Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 24% and is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our Q2 results, and we remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I have a short-term and then maybe a longer-term question. The short term is on the guidance. The better performance this quarter meant that the year could have gone up or, in theory, could have stayed the same or gone down. So given the uncertainty, why the confidence to even slightly nudge up the back half when you could have just kept it more conservative? \nLauren Hobart: Simeon, I'll take that one. That was your short-term question. Guidance, we felt, given the momentum that we had in Q2, the strong Q2 and the fact that within Q2, sequential -- our comp sequentially accelerated as we moved into July and the back-to-school season and our inventory started to be in stock more than it had been before, we feel like we're going into the back half with a lot of momentum. And thus, we wanted to appropriately adjust our guidance and take the low end of the range up. \nNavdeep Gupta: And Simeon, just on the EPS basis, I would say that we also raised our EPS expectations, and that was driven by, if you recall at the end of Q1, we had kind of foreshadowed that the freight and the fuel expenses were continuing to remain elevated versus last year but continuing to rise. And what we have seen in the last, call it, 3 months, that they are not remaining -- they're not going as fast up as they were going before, and some of that favorability was contemplated in our adjustment of the EPS expectation for full year. \nSimeon Gutman: Got it, okay. And then the longer-term question is the stacks, the comp stacks, are holding up at remarkably strong levels even though the top line this quarter declined a little. I guess the skeptic would say that some of the demand post COVID is holding up a little bit longer than we think, and it's going to eventually subside.\n The non-skeptic, [ the bull ], would say, this is new normal and we continue to move higher. Do you have any thoughts on that? I guess as you get more information post COVID, I guess, as demand rebases in some categories, how to think about digestion reversion going forward? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Simeon, we agree. Our comps are significantly higher than they were pre COVID, and we believe very strongly that, that is structural in nature, both because consumers have adopted more of a healthy and active outdoor lifestyle and we're getting a bigger market share of that, but also there are many structural changes in our business. There's almost nothing structurally the same in our business as there was several years ago.\n I would point to the fact that our assortment is completely different now than it was. We've got access to higher-heat products, more narrowly distributed product that doesn't -- isn't nearly as susceptible to pricing pressures and promotions. Our product mix has meaningfully changed toward higher-margin products. We've reduced our hunt exposure meaningfully over the past years, and that hunt business was 1,700 basis points below our average.\n We're having success with our vertical brands, which have 600 to 800 basis points higher than our average margin. And then I think one of the most important things is that we have moved our entire marketing effort from what used to be a long-term print-based effort, where we had to make decisions multiple weeks and even months in advance on how we wanted to price and promote, we've moved that all to a digital marketing capability, where we can be much more surgical, much more real-time, much more personalized, so we don't have to put the whole store or the whole website on sale. We can be very, very specific with our pricing and leverage data science to do that.\n So absolutely agree with you. The business is structurally different than it was several years ago, and we are no longer looking at this nor will we ever as a COVID bump that was going to return. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We had a question around inventory and gross margin. I wondered if there was any way to break it down, the inventory between cost and units and maybe any earlier receipts that you might be taking.\n And then just our second question is around the gross margin cadence in the second half, if you expect much difference between Q3 and Q4 and how we should think about the promotional environment around back-to-school and holiday? \nNavdeep Gupta: Kate, in terms of the cost and the units, I would say it's a pretty balanced breakdown between the 2. Definitely a little bit more elevated on the cost side. So that's -- but like we said in our commentary, it is important to look at the inventory versus 2019 just because of where the makeup of the inventory last year was and how the makeup, right, this year is looking very different. We were chasing a lot of categories last year, and we feel much, much better about the in-stocks today. And the last thing I would say is if you look at the growth versus 2019, again on a unit and on a cost basis, it's, call it, comparable view. Lauren? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. As we look to the promotional environment for back-to-school and holiday, we are anticipating a slightly more normalized pricing and promotion environment. If you look versus last year, it was an incredibly benign pricing promotion environment. But all of that is reflected in our go-forward guidance. We're not expecting any surprises there. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on another really solid quarter. Lauren, I'm going to start with you. We've always talked about how the notion that you're about 85% branded is a pretty significant competitive advantage.\n Can you talk about that with regard to return of some vendor levers, say, markdown money or RTV? How is that evolving? And are you seeing any more of it current day or expecting more of it in your forward guidance?\n And then for Navdeep, it's obviously peak inventory period. So wondering what the inventory might look like at the end of third quarter and probably more importantly, at the end of the year? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. Our brand assortment is absolutely a competitive advantage for us. We've got fantastic relationships with our strategic partners. We also are doing a really, really strong job with our vertical brands. We always work with our core partners on managing our inventory levels.\n So yes, we have certain return levers, RTVs, but we also work really real-time to determine how best to move through product. And we have, in our case, a really elevated clearance process, including our new Going, Going, Gone! concept, which allows us to work -- to move product really quickly through if there are any overages. Navdeep, about inventory? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Adrienne, we won't provide the guidance for an inventory on an outlook for Q3 or for full year. However, having said that, the point that I want to make is like Lauren called out in her comments, right? We feel really, really good about where our inventory right now is, especially as we head into the important back-to-school season. We feel good about the inventory levels and our overall composition of the inventory itself. It's very well positioned and very healthy. So we feel very optimistic as we go into the back half of this year. \nOperator: The next question today comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Great quarter and outlook. A couple of quick questions. Just -- could you give a little more color on the categories that outperformed in the second quarter, excluding back-to-school? And the ticket growth, I think you guys said, if I got it right, ticket was up around 8% and transactions down around 8%. Maybe some color around -- I think that would mean decelerating transactions versus the first quarter, and some color around what's maybe going on there? And is there any kind of trade-down things happening with your customers as well? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robby. So starting with the categories that outperformed in Q2, we actually had tremendous success across all of our key categories. They were in line with our expectations. Footwear, in particular, is really strong, given our assortment is absolutely best-in-class, and that's driving incredible success with our customers.\n Team Sports have been back and that business is very strong. We were really pleased with the golf business, which sequentially accelerated in Q2 versus Q1 and still remains significantly above 2019. Athletic apparel was the only business that was slightly challenged in Q2 of our core businesses, and that was really because there were some lead shipments in apparel, where some of the spring products came in on top of back-to-school products.\n But even within apparel, once the products started flowing, and our teams have done an absolutely incredible job flowing product and getting it into the stores. In July, we started to see comp significantly improve in athletic apparel as well. So overall, really, really strong across the categories. I'll turn it to Navdeep to answer the ticket question. \nNavdeep Gupta: So let me give a little bit of a breakdown again. So in Q2, our comps declined 5.1%. The transactions actually declined 8.4% and the average ticket was up 3.3%. However, as you can imagine, there's meaningful noise in the transactions data, especially as we are going up against the stimulus payments that were given out last year as well as the kind of the timing of the different markets reopening because of COVID.\n And therefore, we -- if you look at the comp -- the transactions comparison versus 2019, the transactions actually grew in both quarters, Q1 and Q2. And they were much more in line versus kind of the change that you might see if you look at on a transaction -- on a Q1 versus Q2 basis. So hopefully, that gives the answer in terms of the transaction trends. \nRobert Ohmes: That does. That really helps. And just any sort of color around just the consumers' shifting behavior in a high inflation environment, and if you're seeing that kind of trade down stuff in your stores? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Robby, we actually are not seeing a significant trade down. Our consumer is holding up very well. We're not seeing people trade from best to better and better -- from best to better and better to good products. In fact, across all income demographics, the trends are pretty similar. I think that just speaks to the fact that our portfolio has something for everybody.\n If you're looking for the most premium technical piece of equipment or cleats, we've got that for you, but we also have opening price point brands like our DSG brand, which is doing really, really well and has tremendous value and fashion to it. So across the board, no meaning -- our consumer is holding up very well. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Warren Cheng of Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: I had a follow-up on Simeon's question on the comp stack and how it's been remarkably stable. Can you dig in and give us some color on how the pandemic winter categories, in particular, have performed the last few quarters? Are they still normalizing and dragging on that overall comp? Or has that started to normalize and stabilize? Just trying to think through kind of how those categories are going to drag or not drag on comps from here. \nLauren Hobart: Warren, so the \"pandemic-winning\" categories, and by the way, there were a lot of pandemic-winning categories, including footwear and apparel, which remained incredibly strong, some of the more specific pandemic winners like fitness or outdoor equipment bikes, those are acting in line with our expectations and, in fact, are still significantly above 2019 levels. So while there is some adjustment going on year-to-year due to the surge in those businesses, they are significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic. \nWarren Cheng: Got it. And my follow-up. I thought you guys made an interesting comment in your prepared remarks. You called out that more higher heat, more narrowly-distributed product has been a driver of the merch margin. If we step back and look at that 400 basis points of merch margin expansion you've achieved since 2019, has the mix shift component, some mix shift to high heat product, higher-margin product, has that been the more material driver? Or has the lower markdowns and lower promos been the more material driver? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, this is -- I would say it actually is all balanced, right? If you look at it, what we are seeing is that the mix shift that we have gotten from the hunt product, which used to have 1,700 basis points lower margin rate, going down as well as acceleration of the vertical brands with 600 to 800 basis points is 1 driver of mix.\n And as you called out, the premium of products that we carry, especially in the key categories like footwear and apparel as well, we are seeing benefits in twofold: one, the benefit is coming because of the margin rates from this category. The bigger benefit, like you called out, is coming because of the lack of promotion that -- because these are highly allocated product. It's a combination of both of those things that is also driving our merch margins higher. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: You talked about momentum in the business and called out July and back-to-school. I know you don't guide to the quarters, but any thoughts on the cadence? And as you revisited the guidance, did your internal expectations change for the back half in 3Q versus 4Q? \nNavdeep Gupta: Chris, like you called out, right, we were pleased with the way the quarter 2 finished. And if you look at the tail end of July, it's kind of the early season of the back-to-school season. If you look at that as a testament of where we are expecting for back-to-school season, we are very happy with the early start of the back-to-school season.\n And yes, and you also called out correctly the one guide to the inter-quarter trend. But we -- the inventory levels that we have, the in-stock position that we are going into the important back-to-school season, we are very pleased with that.\n In terms of the internal expectation, definitely, if you look at what we did at the lower end of the guidance of raising the low end of the guidance to minus 6% for the full year, that kind of flowed not only the benefit that we saw from Q2 but also our optimism around the consumer trend holding up well, better than we had kind of feared at the end of Q1. And that has been factored into the -- bringing the low end of the guidance up to minus 6%. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then you also mentioned on the expectation at 3Q, you'll have some promotional normalization. So how are you thinking about that margin stack that you referenced for the second quarter? Do we see any degradation in that in the third quarter? Obviously, still very strong versus 3Q '19, but does it lessen in the third quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Chris, I don't think we called out that we anticipate our promotions will be going up. What we called out in our guidance is the fact that what we don't know is what the overall promotional landscape in the back half will look like. And that is what has been factored into our guidance. So if we continue to see a benign environment, that will be a factor into the actual results for Q3.\n There are, like Lauren indicated, there are certain categories where we are a bit heavier like, say, in apparel, and we will be appropriately activating around those products as we go into the back half. However, even that impact has been contemplated into our guidance, and so we feel really strongly about the guidance that we have given for the full year. \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Chris, I would just add that long term, we still feel very confident that structurally, we will maintain more than half of our -- the margin gains that we've gotten over the past couple of years. \nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nAtul Maheswari: This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. First, a quick question on the comp guidance. At the midpoint, it implies that the 3-year CAGR, so the 3-year geometric stacks in the back half, decelerate relative to the second quarter and the first half. So does this reflect the caution that, Lauren, you cited in the prepared remarks with respect to your guidance? And does the comp guidance assume that demand for your categories in the back half decelerate further from what you saw in the second quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I would say like we called out in our prepared comments, right, we are appropriately being cautious about our expectations for fall. And the macroeconomic situation as well as the geopolitical situation continue to remain challenge.\n So we need to be cognizant of those trends, and that is what has been contemplated in our guidance. And if you look at the high end of the guidance and the low end of the guidance, yes, the midpoint is there, it is. But at the high end of the guidance, we are expecting the comp to be minus 2% for full year. \nLauren Hobart: Yes, I would also point out the comparison that you're making versus triple year of 2019 includes the fact that we were very, very promotional in 2019. So while we are contemplating that there will be some normalized pricing and promotion in the back half, that could be impacting the comps as well on a 3-year stack. \nAtul Maheswari: Got it. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up question is, I mean, granted that there are a lot of reasons to believe that the current comp levels and the current sales levels are sustainable, but in the event that comps do remain pressured in 2023, how much room is there to cut back on operating expenses to manage profitability?\n If I look at your P&L, your SG&A margin has not really leveraged much versus 2019 despite sales being 35% higher. So one would think that there is room to cut back on costs next year, should sales come under pressure, but would love to get your thoughts on it as well. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. So we have tremendous amount of flexibility in our P&L, if you look at it, right? The first thing is, and I mean, we are talking about a hypothetical here in case the 2023 sales are down because we are not hiding anything like that. We feel really optimistic about our business, keeping the macroeconomic situations aside. But just looking into the P&L flexibility, the first thing would be we'll look into the variable expenses.  And to the extent you called out, there is flexibility even in our discretionary and our fixed expenses.\n And then lastly, as you called out, we -- like we said, we only have 8% share today in a very strong industry that is doing really well. So we are being aggressive in terms of our investments in the key categories and in key capabilities to be able to ensure the long-term sustainability of the trends that we have been driving. And we potentially could look into those investments as well, if need be. But we feel very optimistic about the long-term sales and the profit trajectory of the business. \nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk a little bit more about the footwear category. Curious about your performance in Nike product versus non-Nike product, if that's something that you might be willing to give more color on. And also, I would love to hear an update on the linkage of your app with the Nike app and what that might be doing in terms of new customer acquisition if, in fact, it is bringing in new customers into your network? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Paul. Footwear is doing incredibly well across the board. Nike is doing well. Other brands are doing very well. So just in general, the quality of our assortment and the type of products we have is so meaningfully different than it was before that, that business is really being responded to very well by consumers.\n Our connected membership with Nike continues to be really fruitful. We are working together. We're starting as the supply chain continues to improve, starting to get some higher-heat product going through that connection, and we are growing new customers that are jointly connected to Nike and DICK'S each quarter meaningfully, this past quarter as well. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then just a follow-up. Just thinking out to next year, I don't know if you -- sorry if I missed any update you gave on some of the younger growing concepts, but just performance in the quarter, how are you thinking about growth for next year? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So we -- Public Lands has 3 stores now. We're very, very pleased with how that's doing. It's very small, obviously, compared to the large DICK'S business. Our House of Sport concept continues to do very, very well and we're learning significantly from that experience. We're going to be growing more House of Sport experiences go forward, but we're also taking lessons and rethinking throughout the entire chain how we can improve the service and the experience.\n And similarly, with Golf Galaxy Performance Center, we are redeveloping, reinventing the consumer experience. We'll continue to invest in more Golf Galaxy Performance Centers but also bringing the learnings through the rest of that chain. The last new concept that is really doing very well right now is our Going, Going, Gone! and warehouse channel. That business is obviously in an inflationary environment. It's great to have that kind of channel. We've built significantly more even in the past months, and we're finding the consumer responding very well to that channel as well. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. So you -- the comment -- I want to go back to the comment about maintaining at least 50% of the margin gained during the pandemic. And so if I look at it on the EBT line, that implies something a little bit north of about 10.8%, 10.9%. Your guidance this year is 10.7%. Does that imply or can we infer that you think margin is going to be down this year, obviously, versus last year, but they sort of bottom here and start to go back up in 2013 (sic) [ 2023 ]. Is that a reasonable assumption based on that comment? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Mike, if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, yes, you are right that we are maintaining a majority of the margins that we have driven over 2019. And again, we're not going to guide to 2023. Like we said, we are very confident about the sales and the earnings trajectory of the business over the long term. The biggest unknown, if you think about '23, is around the macroeconomic condition. So if those -- keeping the macro aside, your thesis is spot on. We feel really optimistic about the sales and the profit trajectory of the business over the long term. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Great. Fair enough. As a follow-up, you gave some color -- some good color on components of the P&L. We can obviously make our own estimates, but one missing piece, if you would. How should we think about interest expense -- non-GAAP interest expense after the adjustments for the convert? How should we think about that in the back half of the year or full year? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. The biggest variable factor, if you look at it, again, if you're doing the year-over-year comparison is the fact that we didn't have the long-term senior notes that we have outstanding on the balance sheet today. So if you keep -- and we believe that is the right capital structure for us as a company. So that is a structural piece.\n The piece that is -- if you look in both in Q1 and in Q2, we had the onetime cost associated with settlement of the convertible notes to the tune of just over $6 million, and if we do make another transaction like that in the second half, there will be a corresponding cost. But that is onetime in nature. It's associated with just unwinding of the convert earlier than it is due. \nMichael Baker: So putting that all together, would you care to just give us a non-GAAP interest expense number? Or we can certainly figure it out, but it might just be easier for everyone if you told us how to expect non-GAAP interest in the third and fourth quarter. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, non-GAAP interest expense would be pretty much in line with Q2, with the exception of the $6.1 million that we called out for the onetime transaction cost. \nOperator: Next today is Cowen's John Kernan. \nJohn Kernan: Wanted to go back to maybe the merchandise margin expectations. The assumptions for apparel, in particular, it looks like some of the vendors moved away from [ mats ]. Promotions look high in store. They look -- inventory units and costs on all the vendors balance sheets look fairly high. So what's the assumption for athletic apparel as we move through the back half of the year? When do you think we'll be in a normalized promotional environment in that apparel category as we go into next year? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, John. We are working really closely with our vendors. And you're right that apparel is a category where we're all working due to fleet through to make sure that we clear through the product. We are moving through that through our Going, Going, Gone! channel, through also our DICK'S clearance activity.\n It's hard to know when exactly we'll see a normalized promotional activity, but we do have everything that we anticipate reflected into our guidance, and we are marking some apparel down right now. That's included in our guidance and it's moving well through the system. So we're hoping for improvement in the near term. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe just a follow-up to the earlier question on inventory balance into year end and maybe just the costs associated with some of the inventory on balance sheet now. How do we -- how should we expect some of the costs associated with the current inventory units on the balance sheet?\n Obviously, freight is elevated, product costs need to be moving higher. Could some of this carry over into next year? How should we think about the cost piece of the inventory that's on the balance sheet right now for both you and a lot of your vendors? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, I would say that some of that cost will continue into next year as well. As you can imagine, the cost increases that have been taken this year, it will take some time for us to be able to sell through that inventory. So that cost pressure, as you look from the freight cost increases, especially, will remain with us, I would say, until an early part of next year.\n The piece that is unknown is how the overall supply chain landscape continues to remain for the balance of this year. We feel better about that as we are going into the second half versus how we felt, call it, 3 months ago at the end of Q1. So we'll have to continue to navigate that cost pressures as we go through the balance of this year. \nJohn Kernan: Okay, that's helpful. Best of luck and congrats on the success through this year. \nOperator: The next question today comes from Sam Poser of Williams Trading. \nSamuel Poser: I have a follow-up on the last question. In regard to the -- can you give us some more color on what happened in July and if the MAP holiday that started towards the end of the month helped that? And are you being -- are you having to absorb any of the markdowns associated with that MAP holiday? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So we did have a strong month throughout July in the business overall and in apparel, so the MAP rates at the end of the month, we participated in them. We absorbed an appropriate portion of that as do our brand partners. So nothing meaningful to talk about there. \nSamuel Poser: And then secondly, a lot of the conversation is about what may happen next and about what the consumer is going to do. Can you talk about the improvement in all these investments you're doing in digital, in consumer engagement, both in the store and online to help -- it appears to have helped you overcome some of the concerns you had about the macro. And can you talk about how that's evolving and how that bit of flexibility may or may not help you both in good and bad times? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thank you, Sam. It's a great question. We have been working on improving our entire omnichannel experience over the past several years. And so you're seeing us, first of all, bring experiences into our DICK'S stores and our Golf Galaxy stores that the consumer is responding really well to; elevated service levels, which the consumer also is valuing so that they can find the right product for them. We've completely transformed our marketing so that we are much more digitally savvy and we can be much more personalized.\n And I think you see all of that when you look at our athlete database. One thing that we haven't mentioned on the call yet, I don't think, is that our ScoreCard Gold customers who are now 5 million strong are contributing 40% of our sales. So they are growing in terms of their contribution and their mix, which again speaks to the fact that we are creating engagement with our customers. So the entire experience from a customer standpoint, both online and in-store, is meaningfully improved from what it was several years ago. \nSamuel Poser: I just have a quick follow-up. How much of sort of this MAP -- how much when you look at what the consumer is doing and what you're doing and so on, do you feel, is in your control versus sort of what's happening on the macro? Because everybody asks about what the consumer is going to do. But my question is what -- how much of this do you really believe you have control of to keep that consumer coming again, both in good times and bad? \nNavdeep Gupta: Sam, to me, the way to think about this would be to look at the structural drivers of what is in our control, and we have done a really, really good job around. So the things that I look to is, quite frankly, that we have 16 million new athletes that we acquired over the last couple of years alone. And like Lauren mentioned, the ability to be able to really engage with them is definitely differentiated approach that we have than a lot of players in the industry.\n And then when you look at, in terms of the access that we have gotten of the high heat and kind of the narrowly distributed product also drives the differentiation that is much more in our control. And then looking very similarly on a P&L basis, if you look, the drivers that we called out to the margin rate improvement are much more structural improvements that we have made in our business very, very consciously over the last few years, and those are the reasons why we feel really optimistic about the long-term sales and the profitability trajectory of the company. \nLauren Hobart: I would add to that, that our product mix and our assortment, while some of it you may consider discretionary, there are things in our business that are essential. And that's everything from making sure that your kids have the right cleats on their feet to equipment that you need to perform at your best to if you're outside running and your shoes are worn down. So we do have products that have held up well in prior recessions and the fact that we offer different price points and different levels for everybody is something in our control. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: On the changing guide, can you remind us the expectation for promotions, given how elevated inventory levels are across a lot of retail today? And then on 2Q, can you unpack the gross margin decline between merch, occupancy, e-comm and if there's any other items that played into the quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Chuck, I'll take the second question first and then I'll come back to your first question. So if you look at the de-comp of the gross profit decline, within that, the merch margin declined 197 basis points and that's probably the biggest driver. And like we called out, right, there was pressure, as you can expect, from the supply chain cost because of the freight cost and the occupancy deleverage because of the negative comps.\n When you -- the way to think about the gross margin decline, to me, this was expected and we had contemplated and guided to that at the beginning of the year. What is -- what we have -- we are continuing to look deeper into is to make sure that we are maintaining a vast majority of the margins and the structural changes we have made versus 2019.\n Coming back to your first question in terms of the promotional expectations, so we are expecting -- or in our guidance, we have contemplated a more normalized promotional landscape in the second half. Not that it will go back to 2019 time frame as it was then, but it definitely may not be -- or it may not be as benign as what we saw in 2021. So that is what has been contemplated in our guidance. \nCharles Grom: Great. And then as a follow-up, you talked about better tools to control pricing. And I think that's been one of the key building blocks on the merchandise margin improvement. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Is that zone pricing? Just a little bit more color. \nLauren Hobart: Yes, we've developed a really strong data science capability where we can optimize pricing. And we're looking to do that real-time item by item and market and consumer by consumer. So that is a key advantage that we've built over time. \nOperator: Our next question in the queue comes from Justin Kleber of Baird. \nJustin Kleber: If I look at the midpoint of your guidance on sales, it assumes that you're going to be up about 36% from '19. Just curious how you bridge that gap between growth in the sector versus your market share gains. I know, Navdeep, you mentioned 8% share earlier, which I think is the same number you have in the investor deck for 2020. It just seems like your growth is outpacing the industry. So any updated thoughts on where share stands today? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Justin, we are pleased with the performance that we have driven through the first half of this year. And if you look at it, and we have definitely gained share in the first half of this year. And that is kind of our expectation as well with the differentiating capabilities that we have, we will be able to continue to gain share, especially in the key categories where -- which are core categories for us as we think about footwear, apparel, team sports and golf. \nJustin Kleber: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the promotional environment. Have you guys changed your internal expectations from a merch margin perspective over the back half of this year relative to what you were thinking back in May? \nNavdeep Gupta: I would say it's a combination of both of those things. Yes, the internal capabilities are the biggest unknown. In terms of the midpoint of the guidance, continues to be more to do with the external environment versus our internal expectations. \nOperator: Next we'll take a question from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: Congrats on the quarter. In terms of the inventory, how is the flow of goods these days in apparel versus footwear versus hardware? Like are you seeing -- I mean, hardlines. Are you seeing differences among the categories and the flow of goods and are you getting things on time? Are you still finding you need to kind of accelerate orders or order more than you anticipate getting because you won't get the full order fulfilled? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Our inventory, overall, I think it's important just to restate that our inventory is very healthy and we do not -- we are not concerned that there's toxicity in our inventory. Our flow of goods has improved significantly category by category throughout the last 2.5 years. It's been a series of different challenges. The most recent challenge was apparel, as I mentioned, but we are -- that is moving now, and we are working through the backlog that was there and clearing that through, and it is affecting our sales as well.\n When it comes to some of our hardline categories, say, fitness and outdoor equipment, we have bought -- that is -- we have a lot of inventory there that we just -- we're buying around for next year. So no issues with flow there. And footwear has been pretty good. So flow is good. It's just -- there's -- over the last 2.5 years, something is a new challenge every few months. So that's how we're managing it. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Yes, that's helpful. And then kind of what are you guys seeing these days from a labor perspective? Like I know wage pressures there, and we keep hearing about how hard it is to get talent, especially at distribution centers. And I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing from your stores and distribution centers. Do you have the staffing you need in gearing up for this holiday season? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Labor -- there has been labor shortage in the market for a couple of years now. It has improved. We have not been having issues that maybe some other people are having in terms of not being able to staff appropriately. Our stores have remained fully staffed. Our distribution centers are staffed and operating well.\n And I think that, that speaks to the fact that we -- obviously, we have a competitive wage and our wage costs have gone up as everybody's has. But more importantly, our teammate engagement, our employee engagement is at an all-time high. And I do think that being a fun and great place to work is meaningfully a competitive advantage for us that's made a meaningful improvement in this area for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: My question is on the high heat and narrowly distributed products that you mentioned being key to driving margin expansion for the last 3 years. Could you give us a sense of what your sales mix is of those products relative to 2019 and what the margin differential is on those products relative to average, realized margin differential it is? \nNavdeep Gupta: Seth, definitely, the mix of those products, if you look -- within the key categories like footwear, the mix is significantly higher compared to where it was in 2019. And in terms of the margin, the margin also -- the net margin that -- the realized margin is also higher. It's a combination, like we said. The promotional intensity on those products and how narrowly distributed they are helps us drive our incremental margin in that as well. \nSeth Basham: Got it. But can you provide any more quantification? Are we talking 1,000 basis point difference in mix in high heat and narrowly distributed products relative to 2019? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. As we have called out, it's a very proportional view between the mix benefit that we have driven between the lower penetration of hunt, the vertical brands, the pricing capabilities that Lauren talked about as well as the narrowly distributed mix and the higher heat product that we have. So it's balanced between all 3 of those levels. \nSeth Basham: Got it, okay. And my follow-up question is just, I know you don't normally talk too much about cadence in the quarter, but can you give us a sense of whether or not your traffic or transactions growth on a comparable store sales basis improved through the quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: It's very, very noisy to look on a year-over-year basis because of the stimulus impact and the timing of stimulus from last year. The way I would look at it is if you look at it versus 2019, it was pretty balanced, and we were pleased with the overall trajectory of the traffic as -- even looking back into Q1 of this year. \nOperator: Next, we have a question from Jim Duffy of Stifel. \nJim Duffy: A few around the apparel business. On the spring product, I'm curious. Will you carry inventory over to spring '23? Or have you pushed that back to the vendors, given the dynamic of late deliveries? And then given the environment, do you foresee favorable buying opportunities for spring '23 in the apparel business? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Jim. We are looking -- some of the seasonal business is -- well, some of the business in apparel is seasonal and won't be appropriate to carry over to fiscal '23. Some of it is appropriate. We work with our vendors to cancel where appropriate and/or our RTV.\n But mostly, we are working together now to clear through any overages, any late product that isn't seasonal right now or that needs to move before we get into holiday. So -- and yes, I do think we see favorable buying opportunities in spring '23, where we could be buying now for them. \nOperator: And finally, our last question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: I, too, would like to add my congratulations for another extraordinarily solid quarter. So congrats. The questions I have. I guess they're longer term in nature. But I mean when we look at the business, just to understand what's really -- kind of what's really happening here. Your business is clearly, as you mentioned in your prepared comments in response to the question, we've clearly [ restrengthened ] stronger here over the past couple of years and a few years.\n So as you look at it, do you think that's more -- I mean, is it more a function of behavioral changes on the part of your consumers that took hold during the pandemic? Or these internal initiatives, in particular on the merchandising side? \n But then the follow-up question I have for that, to the extent that you've now shifted the business to better products, higher end product, clearly, we're seeing no indication of this right now, but does that make DICK'S or render DICK'S potentially more susceptible in a weaker [ spending ] environment? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Brian. So our business certainly has strengthened, as you said. And I would say this is more a function of the strategies that we have put in place over the past 5 years to make our business completely transformed. You cannot look at our merchandising assortment and not notice just how completely different it is. At the same time, we've been fortunate that our consumer has chosen a more outdoor lifestyle, a healthier lifestyle, more active. \n And so the pie is growing. But I would say the bigger change, if you look over the past several years, is the strategies that we've put in place in the business. With the high-end products, people spend money on what's important to them and these products are highly desirable. So we're seeing that now even though it's a tougher -- it's an inflationary time frame. So we're happy to have that product and to be delighting consumers in that way. \nOperator: We have no further questions in the queue today, so I'll turn the call back to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for closing remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I will look forward to seeing you and talking next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrate the strength of our core strategies and the foundational improvements we've made across our business over the past 5 years. In fact, we delivered approximately the same EBT in Q2 as we did in all of fiscal 2019.\n While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, the DICK's Sporting Goods consumer has held up quite well. Over the past 2 years, they've made lasting lifestyle changes focused on health and fitness, sports and outdoor activities, and we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on these secular trends.\n Our inventory is healthy and well positioned with improved in-stock levels in key categories. Importantly, we are raising our full year outlook, which continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution, given today's macroeconomic environment and contemplates an approximate 10.7% EBT margin at the midpoint.\n Now to our results. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered second quarter sales of $3.1 billion. This included a comparable store sales decline of 5.1% and, as expected, represented a sequential improvement from the first quarter. It's important to highlight that our sales continued to run substantially above pre-COVID levels, up 38% versus Q2 2019, reinforcing that the favorable shift in consumer behavior that I just mentioned is durable, and our actions to capitalize on this shift are yielding strong results.\n Notably, for the year, our key athlete success metrics, inclusive of acquisitions, new athlete retention, repeat purchasing and omnichannel behavior are elevated across the board compared to pre-COVID levels. Our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and favorable product mix, continue to drive strong merchandise margin. Our merchandise margin rate was up 439 basis points versus Q2 2019 as we maintained the majority of the merchandise margin expansion that we drove over the past 2 years.\n Before continuing, let me emphasize a critical point. The content of the product that we carry today is very different from the product that we carried 5 years ago. It's higher heat and more narrowly distributed than what you'll find in the marketplace and therefore, it is not as susceptible to promotions. In addition, the tools we have today to surgically adjust pricing and promotions are significantly more sophisticated than they were several years ago.\n Lastly, our product mix has structurally shifted towards higher-margin categories. We've materially reduced hunt exposure, which had margins approximately 1,700 basis points below the company average in 2019, and we continue to grow our vertical brands, which currently have margins between 600 to 800 basis points above the national brands.\n Looking ahead, we remain very confident that our merchandise margin will be meaningfully higher compared to pre-COVID levels on an annual basis, and that this improved profitability, is sustainable due to these foundational changes in our business. With our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margins and operating efficiencies compared to pre-COVID levels, we achieved double-digit EBT margin of nearly 14%, approximately 2x our Q2 2019 EBT margin. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.68 in Q2 compared to $3.69 for the entire fiscal year of 2019.\n As we continue our transformational journey, we are focused on enhancing our existing strategies to further strengthen our core business and to drive long-term profitable growth. At the heart of these strategies is our athlete experience, and we continue to develop a highly engaging in-store service model to better serve our athletes. Our teammates are highly trained and are focused on creating confidence for our athletes by finding the best product for them.\n Our stores also now have highly experiential elements such as our premium full-service footwear decks, elevated soccer shops, golf simulators, HitTrax technology and batting cages. Our new DICK'S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center stores are tremendous examples of the power of elevated service models and experiential retail. These new concepts are redefining sports retail and providing us with valuable learnings while also driving strong sales and profitability.\n In addition, our digital experiences remain an integral part of our success, and we continue to prioritize investments in technology and in data science to elevate the athlete experience. We're focused on advancing our personalization capabilities and enhancing our one-to-one relationships with our athletes through our digital marketing, ensuring we serve them the most relevant products at the right time.\n Our personalization strategies are fueled by our robust and growing ScoreCard loyalty program and total athlete database. We now have over 25 million active ScoreCard loyalty members, a valuable cohort that has grown in recent years. And during the second quarter, our ScoreCard members generated well over 70% of our total sales, up approximately 200 basis points from the same period last year.\n Furthermore, our omnichannel platform, which features our stores as a hub, is an important competitive advantage for us. During the second quarter, our stores enabled over 90% of our total sales, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for omnichannel fulfillment.\n Next, within merchandising, our brand portfolio is a tremendous asset. And in fact, our data tells us that approximately 80% of our active athletes look to DICK'S for a multi-branded shopping experience. Importantly, our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever, and we are continuing to develop relationships with new and emerging brands. \n At the same time, we are creating and growing disruptive vertical brands like CALIA, VRST and DSG. Our assortment is on trend across categories, and we -- our wide range of price points ensures we are able to meet the needs of all athletes.\n Our teammates are our greatest assets, and we see our ability to attract and retain talent as a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for us. We're proud of our high teammate engagement levels, which reflect our efforts to be a great place to work. We'll continue to invest in our teammates and our enhanced service model to maintain our strong culture and drive a top-tier athlete experience.\n In closing, our strategies are working, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth. We're the clear market leader in a large fragmented industry, and we believe we are well positioned to continue taking market share and extending our lead. Through the macro -- though the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on meeting the current needs of our athletes.\n Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. Simeon, I'll take that one. That was your short-term question. Guidance, we felt, given the momentum that we had in Q2, the strong Q2 and the fact that within Q2, sequential -- our comp sequentially accelerated as we moved into July and the back-to-school season and our inventory started to be in stock more than it had been before, we feel like we're going into the back half with a lot of momentum. And thus, we wanted to appropriately adjust our guidance and take the low end of the range up. Yes, Simeon, we agree. Our comps are significantly higher than they were pre COVID, and we believe very strongly that, that is structural in nature, both because consumers have adopted more of a healthy and active outdoor lifestyle and we're getting a bigger market share of that, but also there are many structural changes in our business. There's almost nothing structurally the same in our business as there was several years ago.\n I would point to the fact that our assortment is completely different now than it was. We've got access to higher-heat products, more narrowly distributed product that doesn't -- isn't nearly as susceptible to pricing pressures and promotions. Our product mix has meaningfully changed toward higher-margin products. We've reduced our hunt exposure meaningfully over the past years, and that hunt business was 1,700 basis points below our average.\n We're having success with our vertical brands, which have 600 to 800 basis points higher than our average margin. And then I think one of the most important things is that we have moved our entire marketing effort from what used to be a long-term print-based effort, where we had to make decisions multiple weeks and even months in advance on how we wanted to price and promote, we've moved that all to a digital marketing capability, where we can be much more surgical, much more real-time, much more personalized, so we don't have to put the whole store or the whole website on sale. We can be very, very specific with our pricing and leverage data science to do that.\n So absolutely agree with you. The business is structurally different than it was several years ago, and we are no longer looking at this nor will we ever as a COVID bump that was going to return. Yes. As we look to the promotional environment for back-to-school and holiday, we are anticipating a slightly more normalized pricing and promotion environment. If you look versus last year, it was an incredibly benign pricing promotion environment. But all of that is reflected in our go-forward guidance. We're not expecting any surprises there. Thanks, Adrienne. Our brand assortment is absolutely a competitive advantage for us. We've got fantastic relationships with our strategic partners. We also are doing a really, really strong job with our vertical brands. We always work with our core partners on managing our inventory levels.\n So yes, we have certain return levers, RTVs, but we also work really real-time to determine how best to move through product. And we have, in our case, a really elevated clearance process, including our new Going, Going, Gone! concept, which allows us to work -- to move product really quickly through if there are any overages. Navdeep, about inventory? Thanks, Robby. So starting with the categories that outperformed in Q2, we actually had tremendous success across all of our key categories. They were in line with our expectations. Footwear, in particular, is really strong, given our assortment is absolutely best-in-class, and that's driving incredible success with our customers.\n Team Sports have been back and that business is very strong. We were really pleased with the golf business, which sequentially accelerated in Q2 versus Q1 and still remains significantly above 2019. Athletic apparel was the only business that was slightly challenged in Q2 of our core businesses, and that was really because there were some lead shipments in apparel, where some of the spring products came in on top of back-to-school products.\n But even within apparel, once the products started flowing, and our teams have done an absolutely incredible job flowing product and getting it into the stores. In July, we started to see comp significantly improve in athletic apparel as well. So overall, really, really strong across the categories. I'll turn it to Navdeep to answer the ticket question. Yes. Robby, we actually are not seeing a significant trade down. Our consumer is holding up very well. We're not seeing people trade from best to better and better -- from best to better and better to good products. In fact, across all income demographics, the trends are pretty similar. I think that just speaks to the fact that our portfolio has something for everybody.\n If you're looking for the most premium technical piece of equipment or cleats, we've got that for you, but we also have opening price point brands like our DSG brand, which is doing really, really well and has tremendous value and fashion to it. So across the board, no meaning -- our consumer is holding up very well. Warren, so the \"pandemic-winning\" categories, and by the way, there were a lot of pandemic-winning categories, including footwear and apparel, which remained incredibly strong, some of the more specific pandemic winners like fitness or outdoor equipment bikes, those are acting in line with our expectations and, in fact, are still significantly above 2019 levels. So while there is some adjustment going on year-to-year due to the surge in those businesses, they are significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic. Yes, Chris, I would just add that long term, we still feel very confident that structurally, we will maintain more than half of our -- the margin gains that we've gotten over the past couple of years. Yes, I would also point out the comparison that you're making versus triple year of 2019 includes the fact that we were very, very promotional in 2019. So while we are contemplating that there will be some normalized pricing and promotion in the back half, that could be impacting the comps as well on a 3-year stack. Thanks, Paul. Footwear is doing incredibly well across the board. Nike is doing well. Other brands are doing very well. So just in general, the quality of our assortment and the type of products we have is so meaningfully different than it was before that, that business is really being responded to very well by consumers.\n Our connected membership with Nike continues to be really fruitful. We are working together. We're starting as the supply chain continues to improve, starting to get some higher-heat product going through that connection, and we are growing new customers that are jointly connected to Nike and DICK'S each quarter meaningfully, this past quarter as well. Yes. So we -- Public Lands has 3 stores now. We're very, very pleased with how that's doing. It's very small, obviously, compared to the large DICK'S business. Our House of Sport concept continues to do very, very well and we're learning significantly from that experience. We're going to be growing more House of Sport experiences go forward, but we're also taking lessons and rethinking throughout the entire chain how we can improve the service and the experience.\n And similarly, with Golf Galaxy Performance Center, we are redeveloping, reinventing the consumer experience. We'll continue to invest in more Golf Galaxy Performance Centers but also bringing the learnings through the rest of that chain. The last new concept that is really doing very well right now is our Going, Going, Gone! and warehouse channel. That business is obviously in an inflationary environment. It's great to have that kind of channel. We've built significantly more even in the past months, and we're finding the consumer responding very well to that channel as well. Thanks, John. We are working really closely with our vendors. And you're right that apparel is a category where we're all working due to fleet through to make sure that we clear through the product. We are moving through that through our Going, Going, Gone! channel, through also our DICK'S clearance activity.\n It's hard to know when exactly we'll see a normalized promotional activity, but we do have everything that we anticipate reflected into our guidance, and we are marking some apparel down right now. That's included in our guidance and it's moving well through the system. So we're hoping for improvement in the near term. Yes. So we did have a strong month throughout July in the business overall and in apparel, so the MAP rates at the end of the month, we participated in them. We absorbed an appropriate portion of that as do our brand partners. So nothing meaningful to talk about there. Yes. Thank you, Sam. It's a great question. We have been working on improving our entire omnichannel experience over the past several years. And so you're seeing us, first of all, bring experiences into our DICK'S stores and our Golf Galaxy stores that the consumer is responding really well to; elevated service levels, which the consumer also is valuing so that they can find the right product for them. We've completely transformed our marketing so that we are much more digitally savvy and we can be much more personalized.\n And I think you see all of that when you look at our athlete database. One thing that we haven't mentioned on the call yet, I don't think, is that our ScoreCard Gold customers who are now 5 million strong are contributing 40% of our sales. So they are growing in terms of their contribution and their mix, which again speaks to the fact that we are creating engagement with our customers. So the entire experience from a customer standpoint, both online and in-store, is meaningfully improved from what it was several years ago. I would add to that, that our product mix and our assortment, while some of it you may consider discretionary, there are things in our business that are essential. And that's everything from making sure that your kids have the right cleats on their feet to equipment that you need to perform at your best to if you're outside running and your shoes are worn down. So we do have products that have held up well in prior recessions and the fact that we offer different price points and different levels for everybody is something in our control. Yes, we've developed a really strong data science capability where we can optimize pricing. And we're looking to do that real-time item by item and market and consumer by consumer. So that is a key advantage that we've built over time. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Our inventory, overall, I think it's important just to restate that our inventory is very healthy and we do not -- we are not concerned that there's toxicity in our inventory. Our flow of goods has improved significantly category by category throughout the last 2.5 years. It's been a series of different challenges. The most recent challenge was apparel, as I mentioned, but we are -- that is moving now, and we are working through the backlog that was there and clearing that through, and it is affecting our sales as well.\n When it comes to some of our hardline categories, say, fitness and outdoor equipment, we have bought -- that is -- we have a lot of inventory there that we just -- we're buying around for next year. So no issues with flow there. And footwear has been pretty good. So flow is good. It's just -- there's -- over the last 2.5 years, something is a new challenge every few months. So that's how we're managing it. Yes. Labor -- there has been labor shortage in the market for a couple of years now. It has improved. We have not been having issues that maybe some other people are having in terms of not being able to staff appropriately. Our stores have remained fully staffed. Our distribution centers are staffed and operating well.\n And I think that, that speaks to the fact that we -- obviously, we have a competitive wage and our wage costs have gone up as everybody's has. But more importantly, our teammate engagement, our employee engagement is at an all-time high. And I do think that being a fun and great place to work is meaningfully a competitive advantage for us that's made a meaningful improvement in this area for us. Thanks, Jim. We are looking -- some of the seasonal business is -- well, some of the business in apparel is seasonal and won't be appropriate to carry over to fiscal '23. Some of it is appropriate. We work with our vendors to cancel where appropriate and/or our RTV.\n But mostly, we are working together now to clear through any overages, any late product that isn't seasonal right now or that needs to move before we get into holiday. So -- and yes, I do think we see favorable buying opportunities in spring '23, where we could be buying now for them. Thanks, Brian. So our business certainly has strengthened, as you said. And I would say this is more a function of the strategies that we have put in place over the past 5 years to make our business completely transformed. You cannot look at our merchandising assortment and not notice just how completely different it is. At the same time, we've been fortunate that our consumer has chosen a more outdoor lifestyle, a healthier lifestyle, more active. \n And so the pie is growing. But I would say the bigger change, if you look over the past several years, is the strategies that we've put in place in the business. With the high-end products, people spend money on what's important to them and these products are highly desirable. So we're seeing that now even though it's a tougher -- it's an inflationary time frame. So we're happy to have that product and to be delighting consumers in that way. Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I will look forward to seeing you and talking next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our second quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 5% to approximately $3.1 billion. When compared to 2019, sales increased 38%, demonstrating the sustainability of our structurally higher sales base compared to pre-COVID levels. Comparable store sales decreased 5.1% and, as expected, accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. As a reminder, we were lapping a 2-year stack comp increase of approximately 40% in Q2.\n Transactions declined 8.4% while the average ticket increased 3.3%. Within our portfolio, each of our 3 primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear performed generally in line with our expectations. Gross profit in the second quarter was $1.12 billion or 36.03% of net sales and declined 388 basis points versus last year. As expected, this decline was driven by merchandise margin rate decline of 197 basis points, higher supply chain costs and deleverage on fixed occupancy costs from lower sales.\n Compared to 2019, our merchandise margin rate expanded 439 basis points, driven by our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our sophisticated and disciplined pricing strategies and favorable product mix. As Lauren mentioned, because of these structural drivers, we continue to expect our merchandise margin rate to be meaningfully higher than pre-COVID levels on an annual basis.\n SG&A expenses were $657.4 million or 21.12% of net sales and deleveraged 157 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to the decrease in sales. The increase in SG&A dollars was driven by our continued investment in hourly wage rates and talent to support our growth strategies.\n Interest expense was $25.5 million, an increase of $19.3 million on a non-GAAP basis compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 million of interest expense related to our $1.5 billion senior notes issued during Q4 of 2021. The current quarter also included $6.6 million of inducement charge related to our exchange of $100 million outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes.\n Driven by our structurally higher sales, expanded merchandise margin and operating efficiency compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $427.3 million or 13.73% of net sales. This compares to EBT of $151 million or 6.69% of sales in the second quarter of 2019. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.68. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.08 last year and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.26 in 2019.\n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 49% compared to Q2 of last year. However, we were chasing inventory last year amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n A better comparison is against Q2 of 2019, where our 40% increase in inventory was relatively in line with our 38% increase in sales. As Lauren said, our inventory is healthy and well positioned. We are excited about the assortment we have in place for the important back-to-school season, and we are prepared to continue navigating a dynamic global supply chain environment through the rest of the year.\n Turning to our second quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $84.5 million, and we paid $36.9 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged $100 million or approximately 21% of then-outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of the convertible note hedge and warrants for 1.7 million shares of our common stock. Following this exchange, we have $375 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.9 million shares of our stock for $319 million at an average price of $80.84.\n Now let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and continue to deliver meaningful sales and profitability growth over 2019. As a result of our Q2 performance and improved inventory position for the important back-to-school season, we are raising our 2022 guidance. Importantly, as Lauren indicated, our updated outlook continues to incorporate an appropriate level of caution, given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic backdrop, geopolitical environment, and the dynamic global supply chain.\n For the year, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of negative 6% to negative 2% compared to our prior expectation between negative 8% to negative 2%. In addition, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $10 to $12 compared to our prior expectation of $9.15 to $11.70.\n While our outlook is not dependent upon share repurchases beyond the $361 million executed through the end of Q2, we will continue to be opportunistic as the year progresses. EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.7% at the midpoint, more than double our 2019 rate. Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 24% and is based on approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our Q2 results, and we remain very enthusiastic about the future of DICK'S. This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. And Simeon, just on the EPS basis, I would say that we also raised our EPS expectations, and that was driven by, if you recall at the end of Q1, we had kind of foreshadowed that the freight and the fuel expenses were continuing to remain elevated versus last year but continuing to rise. And what we have seen in the last, call it, 3 months, that they are not remaining -- they're not going as fast up as they were going before, and some of that favorability was contemplated in our adjustment of the EPS expectation for full year. Kate, in terms of the cost and the units, I would say it's a pretty balanced breakdown between the 2. Definitely a little bit more elevated on the cost side. So that's -- but like we said in our commentary, it is important to look at the inventory versus 2019 just because of where the makeup of the inventory last year was and how the makeup, right, this year is looking very different. We were chasing a lot of categories last year, and we feel much, much better about the in-stocks today. And the last thing I would say is if you look at the growth versus 2019, again on a unit and on a cost basis, it's, call it, comparable view. Lauren? Yes. Adrienne, we won't provide the guidance for an inventory on an outlook for Q3 or for full year. However, having said that, the point that I want to make is like Lauren called out in her comments, right? We feel really, really good about where our inventory right now is, especially as we head into the important back-to-school season. We feel good about the inventory levels and our overall composition of the inventory itself. It's very well positioned and very healthy. So we feel very optimistic as we go into the back half of this year. So let me give a little bit of a breakdown again. So in Q2, our comps declined 5.1%. The transactions actually declined 8.4% and the average ticket was up 3.3%. However, as you can imagine, there's meaningful noise in the transactions data, especially as we are going up against the stimulus payments that were given out last year as well as the kind of the timing of the different markets reopening because of COVID.\n And therefore, we -- if you look at the comp -- the transactions comparison versus 2019, the transactions actually grew in both quarters, Q1 and Q2. And they were much more in line versus kind of the change that you might see if you look at on a transaction -- on a Q1 versus Q2 basis. So hopefully, that gives the answer in terms of the transaction trends. Yes. Warren, this is -- I would say it actually is all balanced, right? If you look at it, what we are seeing is that the mix shift that we have gotten from the hunt product, which used to have 1,700 basis points lower margin rate, going down as well as acceleration of the vertical brands with 600 to 800 basis points is 1 driver of mix.\n And as you called out, the premium of products that we carry, especially in the key categories like footwear and apparel as well, we are seeing benefits in twofold: one, the benefit is coming because of the margin rates from this category. The bigger benefit, like you called out, is coming because of the lack of promotion that -- because these are highly allocated product. It's a combination of both of those things that is also driving our merch margins higher. Chris, like you called out, right, we were pleased with the way the quarter 2 finished. And if you look at the tail end of July, it's kind of the early season of the back-to-school season. If you look at that as a testament of where we are expecting for back-to-school season, we are very happy with the early start of the back-to-school season.\n And yes, and you also called out correctly the one guide to the inter-quarter trend. But we -- the inventory levels that we have, the in-stock position that we are going into the important back-to-school season, we are very pleased with that.\n In terms of the internal expectation, definitely, if you look at what we did at the lower end of the guidance of raising the low end of the guidance to minus 6% for the full year, that kind of flowed not only the benefit that we saw from Q2 but also our optimism around the consumer trend holding up well, better than we had kind of feared at the end of Q1. And that has been factored into the -- bringing the low end of the guidance up to minus 6%. Yes, Chris, I don't think we called out that we anticipate our promotions will be going up. What we called out in our guidance is the fact that what we don't know is what the overall promotional landscape in the back half will look like. And that is what has been factored into our guidance. So if we continue to see a benign environment, that will be a factor into the actual results for Q3.\n There are, like Lauren indicated, there are certain categories where we are a bit heavier like, say, in apparel, and we will be appropriately activating around those products as we go into the back half. However, even that impact has been contemplated into our guidance, and so we feel really strongly about the guidance that we have given for the full year. Yes. I would say like we called out in our prepared comments, right, we are appropriately being cautious about our expectations for fall. And the macroeconomic situation as well as the geopolitical situation continue to remain challenge.\n So we need to be cognizant of those trends, and that is what has been contemplated in our guidance. And if you look at the high end of the guidance and the low end of the guidance, yes, the midpoint is there, it is. But at the high end of the guidance, we are expecting the comp to be minus 2% for full year. Yes. So we have tremendous amount of flexibility in our P&L, if you look at it, right? The first thing is, and I mean, we are talking about a hypothetical here in case the 2023 sales are down because we are not hiding anything like that. We feel really optimistic about our business, keeping the macroeconomic situations aside. But just looking into the P&L flexibility, the first thing would be we'll look into the variable expenses.  And to the extent you called out, there is flexibility even in our discretionary and our fixed expenses.\n And then lastly, as you called out, we -- like we said, we only have 8% share today in a very strong industry that is doing really well. So we are being aggressive in terms of our investments in the key categories and in key capabilities to be able to ensure the long-term sustainability of the trends that we have been driving. And we potentially could look into those investments as well, if need be. But we feel very optimistic about the long-term sales and the profit trajectory of the business. Yes. Mike, if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, yes, you are right that we are maintaining a majority of the margins that we have driven over 2019. And again, we're not going to guide to 2023. Like we said, we are very confident about the sales and the earnings trajectory of the business over the long term. The biggest unknown, if you think about '23, is around the macroeconomic condition. So if those -- keeping the macro aside, your thesis is spot on. We feel really optimistic about the sales and the profit trajectory of the business over the long term. Yes. The biggest variable factor, if you look at it, again, if you're doing the year-over-year comparison is the fact that we didn't have the long-term senior notes that we have outstanding on the balance sheet today. So if you keep -- and we believe that is the right capital structure for us as a company. So that is a structural piece.\n The piece that is -- if you look in both in Q1 and in Q2, we had the onetime cost associated with settlement of the convertible notes to the tune of just over $6 million, and if we do make another transaction like that in the second half, there will be a corresponding cost. But that is onetime in nature. It's associated with just unwinding of the convert earlier than it is due. Yes, non-GAAP interest expense would be pretty much in line with Q2, with the exception of the $6.1 million that we called out for the onetime transaction cost. Yes, I would say that some of that cost will continue into next year as well. As you can imagine, the cost increases that have been taken this year, it will take some time for us to be able to sell through that inventory. So that cost pressure, as you look from the freight cost increases, especially, will remain with us, I would say, until an early part of next year.\n The piece that is unknown is how the overall supply chain landscape continues to remain for the balance of this year. We feel better about that as we are going into the second half versus how we felt, call it, 3 months ago at the end of Q1. So we'll have to continue to navigate that cost pressures as we go through the balance of this year. Sam, to me, the way to think about this would be to look at the structural drivers of what is in our control, and we have done a really, really good job around. So the things that I look to is, quite frankly, that we have 16 million new athletes that we acquired over the last couple of years alone. And like Lauren mentioned, the ability to be able to really engage with them is definitely differentiated approach that we have than a lot of players in the industry.\n And then when you look at, in terms of the access that we have gotten of the high heat and kind of the narrowly distributed product also drives the differentiation that is much more in our control. And then looking very similarly on a P&L basis, if you look, the drivers that we called out to the margin rate improvement are much more structural improvements that we have made in our business very, very consciously over the last few years, and those are the reasons why we feel really optimistic about the long-term sales and the profitability trajectory of the company. Chuck, I'll take the second question first and then I'll come back to your first question. So if you look at the de-comp of the gross profit decline, within that, the merch margin declined 197 basis points and that's probably the biggest driver. And like we called out, right, there was pressure, as you can expect, from the supply chain cost because of the freight cost and the occupancy deleverage because of the negative comps.\n When you -- the way to think about the gross margin decline, to me, this was expected and we had contemplated and guided to that at the beginning of the year. What is -- what we have -- we are continuing to look deeper into is to make sure that we are maintaining a vast majority of the margins and the structural changes we have made versus 2019.\n Coming back to your first question in terms of the promotional expectations, so we are expecting -- or in our guidance, we have contemplated a more normalized promotional landscape in the second half. Not that it will go back to 2019 time frame as it was then, but it definitely may not be -- or it may not be as benign as what we saw in 2021. So that is what has been contemplated in our guidance. Yes. Justin, we are pleased with the performance that we have driven through the first half of this year. And if you look at it, and we have definitely gained share in the first half of this year. And that is kind of our expectation as well with the differentiating capabilities that we have, we will be able to continue to gain share, especially in the key categories where -- which are core categories for us as we think about footwear, apparel, team sports and golf. I would say it's a combination of both of those things. Yes, the internal capabilities are the biggest unknown. In terms of the midpoint of the guidance, continues to be more to do with the external environment versus our internal expectations. Seth, definitely, the mix of those products, if you look -- within the key categories like footwear, the mix is significantly higher compared to where it was in 2019. And in terms of the margin, the margin also -- the net margin that -- the realized margin is also higher. It's a combination, like we said. The promotional intensity on those products and how narrowly distributed they are helps us drive our incremental margin in that as well. Yes. As we have called out, it's a very proportional view between the mix benefit that we have driven between the lower penetration of hunt, the vertical brands, the pricing capabilities that Lauren talked about as well as the narrowly distributed mix and the higher heat product that we have. So it's balanced between all 3 of those levels. It's very, very noisy to look on a year-over-year basis because of the stimulus impact and the timing of stimulus from last year. The way I would look at it is if you look at it versus 2019, it was pretty balanced, and we were pleased with the overall trajectory of the traffic as -- even looking back into Q1 of this year."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Victoria, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] \n I'll now pass you over to your host, Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2022 results. On today's call will be Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months. \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. \n As required by new accounting rules adopted in the current period, our first quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share assumes share of settlement of our convertible senior notes issued in Q1 2020, which excludes the after-tax interest expense and includes the total shares underlying these notes. Given our intent to settle the principal portion of these notes in cash and the shares that will be delivered by our bond hedged settlements, we do not expect the notes to have a dilutive effect at settlement. Accordingly, we believe that reflecting the notes as debt more closely aligns with the underlying economics of the transaction, which is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. For additional details on this or to find a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure referenced on today's call, please refer to our Investor Relations website. \n And finally, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our second quarter 2022 earnings results on August 23, 2022. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Lauren. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results as our team continued to move with agility and execute well in a highly dynamic environment. Before diving into the results of the quarter, I think it's important to recognize that over the past 2 years, we have demonstrated our ability to adeptly manage through the pandemic and other challenges and we are confident in our continued ability to adapt quickly and execute through uncertain macroeconomic conditions, while keeping our athletes at the heart of every decision we make. \n With that context, I do want to take a moment to address the adjustments we made to our 2022 outlook this morning. Like everyone else, we have been carefully monitoring the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and assessing our expectations based on our experience running our business across economic cycles. With this perspective, we believe it's appropriate to be cautious and are, therefore, lowering our outlook for the year. \n To be clear, we expect our performance will continue to meaningfully exceed 2019 levels, reflecting the strength of our core strategies and the changes we've made in our business over the past 5 years. DICK'S is the clear market leader, and we are well positioned to extend our lead and build on our competitive advantages in the years ahead. We continue to closely watch the macro landscape and have the flexibility in our business to remain nimble. \n Now getting back to our results. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered sales of $2.7 billion in the first quarter. This included a comparable store sales decline of 8.4%, which followed a 117% increase in comp sales in the same period of the prior year. This also reflected the anniversary of significant stimulus payments as well as anticipated sales normalization in certain categories. \n Importantly, sales continued to run substantially above pre-COVID levels, up 41% versus Q1 2019 and sequentially accelerated from last quarter. These top line results reinforce our strong conviction that the shift in consumer behavior over the past 2 years is indeed structural. Consumers have made lasting lifestyle changes, with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in sports and outdoor activities. Our business is squarely at the center of these secular trends and the actions we have taken over the past 5 years to transform our company have given us significant competitive advantages across all aspects of our business. \n Our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined and more sophisticated promotional strategies, continues to drive strong merchandise margin growth. During the quarter, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 143 basis points versus 2021. \n Before continuing, let me underscore this critical point that is not always appreciated about our transformation. The content of the product that we carry today is very different from the products we carried 5 years ago. It's higher heat and more narrowly distributed than what you'll find in the market as a whole, and therefore, it is not as susceptible to promotion. In addition, the tools we have today to surgically adjust pricing are significantly more sophisticated than they were several years ago. With these fundamental changes, we are very confident that the majority of our merchandise margin rate expansion that we've driven over the past 2 years is sustainable. \n Led by our structurally higher sales and merchandise margin compared to pre-COVID levels, we achieved double-digit EBT margin of over 12% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85, both significantly ahead of any pre-COVID first quarter in our history. We entered 2022 in a position of tremendous strength and we're focused on enhancing our existing strategy to further strengthen our core business and drive long-term profitable growth. \n Our approach is centered on our best-in-class omnichannel platform, which features our stores as a hub. During the first quarter, our stores enabled over 90% of total sales, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for omnichannel fulfillment through ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. We also continue to invest in an enhanced service model and lean into highly engaging experiences to better serve our athletes and reinforce their loyalty. \n Our digital capabilities remain core to our omnichannel success and we are continuing to prioritize investments in technology and data science. Furthermore, we remain focused on maintaining our strong culture, putting our teammates, athletes and communities at the center of everything we do. This work continues to have a positive impact, as we were recently awarded back-to-back annual certification by Great Place to Work. I spend a lot of time visiting our stores and distribution centers and the positive energy and sense of community from the teams I meet is fantastic. Our strong dedicated team and our ability to attract and retain talent are key competitive advantages for us. \n Next, within merchandising, our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever. Our assortment is on trend and we are providing our athletes with enhanced access to the hottest styles across a wide range of categories from the top brands in sports. Importantly, we also are ensuring that we have products at prices that address the needs of all athletes. For example, through DSG, our largest vertical brand, we offer high-quality, fashion-forward product at a tremendous value across men's, women's and youth. Our key lifestyle vertical brands, including CALIA and VRST, are also resonating strongly with our athletes and we continue to invest in and grow these brands. \n Lastly, our new concepts, including DICK'S House of Sport, Golf Galaxy Performance Center, Public Lands and Going, Going, Gone!, are delivering promising early results. Today, we are really excited to open our third House of Sport store in Minnetonka, Minnesota. House of Sport has exceeded our expectations and has been a great example of the power of elevated service, community engagement and merchandise presentations. We look forward to continuing to refine and grow these concepts, while pulling key learnings into our core DICK'S and Golf Galaxy chains. \n In closing, we remain confident in our strategies and our ability to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth. DICK'S has a unique and powerful position in the marketplace. Sports and an active lifestyle are important in all times and now more than ever as we help families get outside together and lead active and healthy lives. Our teammates are united behind our common purpose, which is to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams, especially during these times of uncertainty. \n Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 7.5% to approximately $2.7 billion. Comparable store sales decreased 8.4% following a 117% increase in comp sales in the same period last year. As Lauren indicated, comps were impacted as we anniversaried significant stimulus payments from the prior year quarter. And in addition, we saw the anticipated sales normalization in certain categories that surged throughout the pandemic. And as part of this year-over-year anniversary, transactions declined by 6.4% and average ticket declined by 2%. \n Importantly, our sales continue to run significantly above pre-COVID levels. Compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 41% and sequentially accelerated from the most recent quarter. Gross profit in the first quarter was $984.7 million or 36.7% of net sales and declined 83 basis points versus last year. This decline was driven by 103 basis points increase in supply chain-related costs and a deleverage on fixed occupancy cost of 94 basis points from the sales decrease. These items were partially offset by continued merchandise margin rate expansion. For the quarter, merchandise margin increased 143 basis points as we continue to see the benefits from our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined and more sophisticated promotional strategies and clearance pricing. We also saw favorable sales mix. \n SG&A expenses were $615.3 million or 22.79% of net sales and deleveraged 195 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to the decrease in sales. The increase in SG&A expense dollar is driven by our investment in advertising and hourly wage rates. These items were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and $17 million of income associated with changes in the investment values of our deferred compensation plans, which is fully offset by the investment loss recognized in other expense line. In addition, SG&A also included approximately $13 million of COVID-related safety costs in the prior year quarter. \n Driven by our structurally higher sales and merchandise margin compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $331.9 million or 12.29% of net sales. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 last year and $0.62 in 2019. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and cash equivalent and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 40% compared to Q1 of last year, with product flow improving as the quarter progressed. Looking ahead, we feel good about our overall inventory levels for Q2 and are prepared to continue navigating a dynamic global supply chain environment through the rest of the year. \n Turning to our first quarter capital allocations, net capital expenditures were $53.9 million and we paid $46.1 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged $100 million at approximately 17% of the outstanding principle of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of convertible note hedge and warrants for 1.8 million shares of our common stock. Following this exchange, we have approximately $475 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding. We also repurchased 417,000 shares of our stock for $42 million at an average price of $101.39. \n Now let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. We are pleased with the start of our year and continue to see meaningful growth above 2019 levels. However, as Lauren mentioned, we have been carefully monitoring the economic environment and there are many puts and takes at play. With an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, geopolitical environment and a dynamic global supply chain, we believe it is prudent to adopt an appropriately cautious outlook for the year. Thus, we are adjusting our 2022 guidance range. \n For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $9.15 to $11.70 and a comparable store sales in the range of negative 8% to negative 2%. EBT is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.35 billion, with EBT margins expected to be approximately 10% at the midpoint. This includes additional risk in supply chain-related costs and higher wage rates as well as greater than originally anticipated normalization of promotional landscape over the balance of the year. As a reminder, this also includes approximately $55 million of pretax interest expense associated with our $1.5 billion long-term debt. \n Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%, and is based on an approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding. In addition, our plan now includes a minimum of $300 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. Importantly, we are continuing to invest in our business for long term, and for the year, expect the net capital expenditure of $340 million to $365 million. \n In closing, we are pleased with the results of our first quarter. And while we recognize we are in an uncertain economic environment, DICK'S is a clear market leader, and we remain structurally stronger and more profitable company today compared to pre-COVID. And at the midpoint of our updated outlook, we expect sales to increase approximately 35% versus 2019 and EBT margin of approximately 10%, doubling our 2019 EBT rate. Our financial position is strong, ending Q1 with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to drive sales and profitability growth over the long term. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I would like to follow up on the revision. I think the midpoint, it's about a 16% cut, and Navdeep, you mentioned a few factors. Can you talk to us about the current environment? What's changing as we speak? Sales, gross margin, can you talk about the inventory balance? It looks like you're carrying a good amount going into the year. Are you already seeing that elevated promotion? Are you seeing in line with what's in your guidance? So that's my first question. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. It's Lauren. I think those are all very important questions, and I'll try and parse them all out and answer all of them. We have had, as you know, a fantastic, a very good Q1. We're pleased with our Q1. And we had anticipated increases in our freight cost, in our labor costs and in our product costs as we went into the quarter and we were accurate in our forecasting of those expenses.\n There's 2 things that have changed that are driving our approach to the guidance for the rest of the quarter. First is that the consumer is going through an awful lot right now. So obviously, macroeconomic trends are challenging, inflation is putting pressure on the consumer at the gas pump and in grocery store, we all know. And then there's this geopolitical environment that is very, very challenging. At the same time, we see that the expenses of those 3 line items, so freight, labor and perhaps product input costs, are accelerating more quickly than we had anticipated. And so we want to be appropriately cautious as we look forward to the year.\n However, I want to be very clear that we are not seeing any meaningful trends that are different from what we saw in Q1 and we believe our inventory at plus 40% actually is very healthy and we are very pleased with it. In fact, there are areas where if we could have more, we would have more. There's been some disruption in terms of when inventory is flowing in. But we had anticipated that certain categories, like fitness and outdoor equipment would normalize this year. And they have normalized as we expected. We are still chasing products in certain categories and our inventory is healthy. We are not anticipating any significant markdown risk.\n To answer your other question, our -- the promotional environment, we are not seeing a change in the promotional environment. We will obviously continue to monitor that and we will be surgically addressing price changes as we absorb some of the cost increases. But the marketplace has not shifted dramatically in any meaningful way. We are just being appropriately cautious as we look toward a lot of things that are outside of our control when we look at the rest of the year. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. The follow-up is the confidence that the industry or your business won't revert further, and we've been talking about this question for 2 years. But is there any categories that you can point to that -- in which consumption is holding or growing at the structurally higher level? Because we're at a much higher water level, as you mentioned, 30%, 40%, even at the midpoint, I think Navdeep said. So which categories are showing us that we won't see that level of reversion? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Across the board, you're absolutely right. If you look at the last 2 years and look at the consumer, every single category in our business has -- virtually everyone except for hunt, has rebaseline meaningfully higher than our pre-pandemic volume. And that reflects the fact that the consumer is outdoors more. They are running, they are walking, they are playing golf. The pandemic-surging categories that we've all been talking about and we expected to normalize are fitness, outdoor equipment, which will include things like bikes and paddles and golf. And those 3 normalize as we expected them to normalize, but we believe they all have long-term growth potential.\n So we are not changing our outlook on any aspect of our business. We actually think in these types of times, people need to get outside. They need to be active. They want to be with their families, and we are well positioned to serve the needs of these athletes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih at Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Lauren, I want to stay on the promo topic because we as well did not see promos this quarter. I guess my question really is the notion that, say, a partnership with Nike, where you're sort of their premier partner, let's just call it, for lack of a better term. Is that causing other competing brands to actually offer you their best and highest heat product as well, so thereby elevating the entire brand and product platform? That's my first question. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So our partnership with Nike is at an all-time high, as is our partnership with all of our strategic partners. And I think that's a result, not just of a situational moment in time with certain partners, but the fact that we have invested so much in our stores and in our experience, such that brands who are rooted in sport want to actually showcase their product and their brand in our stores.\n So yes, across the board, we are getting access to higher heat and more pristine premier product that's high in consumer demand. And that's a big part of our strategy, and that has been driving our results. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. And then for Navdeep, a couple of quick ones. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 40%. You're comfortable with that. What portion of that is cost inflation, like AUC increase? And what portion of that is in transit? So effectively, I'm trying to get to units, so yes. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Adrienne, maybe before I go into the details, I think one of the ways to think about the inventory is to also look at what was happening to our inventory position as we were going through 2021. If you look at it, as we called out last year, our inventory position continued to build as we went into the year. So what you're comparing Q1 versus Q1 last year, especially our inventory starts and in-stock levels last year in... \nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] \n Hello, everybody, and thank you for standing by. We have reconnected with the speakers. Adrienne, if you would like to go ahead. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: I think that you were in the middle of your discussion on last year's inventory? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Sorry, I'll start back again. So we apologize. I don't know what happened on the line here. We were -- we seem to be connected here at our end and somehow lost the connection. So Adrienne, back to your question, the way we are looking at inventory. We are looking at inventory trends versus 2019 internally because as we talked about in 2021, our inventory levels were building through the year. So the better comparison for inventory is compared to 2019. So our sales are up 41%. Our inventory is up 32%.\n In terms of the balance between in transit as well as unit versus the prices, I would say, yes, we have a little bit elevated levels of in-transit inventory, not necessarily associated with buying the product ahead for the balance of the year. It's much more of -- to do with the product that we expected to receive in Q1 that is slightly delayed. So that's the reason we have a little bit of elevated levels of in-transit inventory. And it's a balance between unit increase versus AUR increases. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane at Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wanted to ask about average ticket, which I think you mentioned was down about 2%. Is there any way to parse out that in terms of how much was price inflation versus how much was the change in mix away from maybe some bigger ticket items during the quarter? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Kate, we haven't given the details on that one. But the way -- the easiest way to think about it is it's a combination. Yes, as you expected and as you called out, that as the COVID surge in categories like fitness and the outdoor equipment normalize, that does put a little bit of a pressure on the ticket size, and that is balanced against the overall AUR increases, inflation related that we have seen. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And then my follow-up question is, we've heard a lot about adverse weather, whether it be in apparel or auto part retail and just how it affected sales in the first quarter. I know you have some weather-sensitive categories like apparel and team sports in the quarter. Were there any markdowns related to that? And if so, could merch margins have been higher in the quarter? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Kate, we -- it's Lauren. We had -- we did not see a significant weather impact in any of the key categories, certainly didn't drive any markdown behavior. The main category that experienced an impact from the colder and wetter spring was golf. But as I said, that met our expectations of normalizing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes at Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: My follow-up question would be maybe more for Navdeep. I was hoping to get more thoughts on what is implied in the, maybe, the midpoint of guidance. The -- I think, Lauren, you said that the consumer is still doing well into 2Q. Does the midpoint of guidance sort of assume the consumer is going to do less well as we move through the year?\n And then also, merchandise margins, really good in the first quarter. Should we expect merchandise margins to look less good kind of sequentially through the year? And then also, you've highlighted these expenses coming through higher than expected. Would you be planning them to accelerate, growth and expenses, to accelerate year-over-year as well?\n And also just a clarification on the 2Q to date being similar to 1Q, is that a same-store sales meaning? So should we sort of look for minus 8% to 9% comps in 2Q? \nNavdeep Gupta: So Robert, that was a very in-depth question. Maybe I'll begin with the last question. So one, we're not giving an inter-quarter guidance here. So what we -- the sentiment that Lauren called out is that we are not seeing a material change in the trends of the business. It has much more to do with the customer and not trying to imply anything in terms of the expectations for Q2.\n So I'll address 3 big questions that you asked. One is the kind of what is our implied midpoint expectations on the sales. Like Lauren said, Q1, we were pleased with our Q1 performance. The business reaccelerated versus 2019 and especially if you look at where we finished in Q4. So we feel really good about the trends of the business and the core categories in Q1. And like Lauren called out again, like we're not seeing a meaningful change in the trajectory of the business in the month of May.\n The takedown in our guidance on the top line expectation is purely coming out of we being appropriately cautious about the outlook on what is happening in kind of the overall economic landscape. The pressure that our consumer and the consumer in general has is something that we wanted to not ignore and wanted to address that upfront. And that has been kind of included in our sales guidance.\n As we think about the other 2 elements that we called out, we have -- we anticipated that the freight expenses would be elevated. There will be inflation as well as there will be wage pressures. But what we are seeing is that these costs have gotten more pronounced in the last 3 months since we gave the original guidance. The fuel prices continue to remain elevated as well as are continuing to go up. So we wanted to acknowledge these risks that we are seeing from a cost structure perspective and we incorporated that in our guidance.\n And the last piece, like we called out, right, we anticipated, again, a little bit of normalization of the promotions in the back half of the year. And now we feel that there may be a higher propensity of the promotions in the back half of the year. Again, we are not seeing anything. It's just being cautious about the overall economic landscape and kind of anticipating what might be happening. And potentially, as Lauren called out, we may be seeing -- we are seeing some increase in input costs. And we may decide not to pass all of those costs to our athletes as well, just trying to do the right thing between the athlete as well as the long-term potential of our business. So that is the third piece that has been contemplated into our guidance. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Robby, I just want to build on one thing, which is that our merch margin forecast going forward still assumes, even in the new guidance, that we are going to maintain the majority of our merch margin gains over the past few years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez at Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Can you talk about private label penetration and performance during the quarter? And then are there any places where private label is not gaining share within your business?\n And then just secondly, if you could just talk about your -- specifically, about apparel and footwear performance and inventory, where you saw strength, where you saw weakness and how you feel about inventories in those categories specifically? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Paul, our vertical brand did extremely well in Q1. And I would point specifically to how pleased we are with the DSG line, and the fact that, that does provide an opening price point with really wonderful fashion is doing incredibly well, as is our new VRST line and our CALIA line. So really, really pleased. And there's not an area I can point to where I think vertical brands are not gaining share across the business.\n From an apparel and footwear performance standpoint in the quarter, footwear did really, really well for all the reasons that we've been talking about and inventory in that category is good. And again, if we could chase more, we would chase more. On the apparel side, we did have some inventory challenges during the quarter, just making sure that we have the right product, the right season product in stock. But we are planning to buy around anything that came in late, so it's not a markdown risk for us, and we believe that by back-to-school apparel should be getting better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers at JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So I just want to follow up on the merchandise margin point. If I could characterize what you said, you basically, at this point, you have passed through input cost pressures and have essentially at least maintained your gross margin rate. Going forward, you're saying there could be some input cost absorption where it causes degradation in your merchandise margin.\n So my follow-up is that if you look on a sort of stack basis versus 2019, merchandise margins did decelerate relative to what you experienced in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? \nLauren Hobart: I'll start off and pass it over to Navdeep to answer your last question. I want to be -- I want to clarify one thing. We have passed some input cost pressures on to consumers, specifically in hardlines, a little bit in softlines, but we have not been passing through all of our input cost pressures. We have been benefiting from some of our improved assortment, our mix and the fact that we're not promotional. So our merch margins are not reflecting the -- even though they're so strong, it's not reflecting the fact that we've passed 100% of the cost forward.\n Now as we look to the future, if costs continue to increase at an accelerated rate, we may have to start passing higher cost increases on. And at that point, we're going to be down at the really specific data-driven pricing optimized level in terms of what the consumer will bear versus what our margin will absorb. And so I just want to clarify that. And then Navdeep, if you can answer the latter part of the question. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Chris, I think there are 2 ways to think about it. Like if you compare it versus -- in fourth quarter of last year, we had called out that we were not promotional. So when you -- and considering how promotional fourth quarter typically is, that benefit was included in our Q4 expectation. We are very pleased with the performance that we have seen from the merchandise margin expansion, especially when you look at it compared to 2019. \n Like Lauren called out, we expect to be able to maintain a vast majority of the merchandise margin gains that we have seen over the last 2 years into this year, and that has been contemplated in our guidance as well. We do anticipate that the promotional landscape will not remain as benign as it has been for the last few years. But our expectation is also not that the promotional landscape goes back to where it used to be pre-COVID levels. So it's somewhere -- it's going to be landing somewhere between the 2, and that's the piece that we will continue to watch out. \nChristopher Horvers: Okay. So just that -- just so I understand. So then really in the fourth quarter, it was just a lack of normal promotion in the holiday season that caused an extra benefit, where in the first quarter you didn't have sort of that year-to-year effect? \nNavdeep Gupta: Exactly. Q1 is not as promotional of a quarter as you typically expect, right, compared to fourth quarter. And that's kind of -- we still were able to expand our merchandise margin, even when compared to Q1 of 2021. And when you look at the merchandise margin expansion versus 2019, we are very pleased with the trajectory that we are holding. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then my quick follow-up is the 100 bps of -- was that all freight? Obviously, diesel sort of mid-quarter -- to your points in the prepared remarks, diesel really ripped higher, up 70% year-over-year mid-quarter. So is that all that impact? And sort of how are you thinking about modeling that on a go-forward basis? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I would say there are -- the biggest one is freight, no questions about it. There are 2 pieces, fuel is what we called out as well as like when you think of the fixed expenses and the deleverage that you get when you have a negative 8.5% comp, that is also included. But the vast majority, I would say, was driven by the freight pressures that we saw.\n Maybe -- sorry, I'll add to this, that this was not a surprise to us. When you look at that decline, it was more of a year-over-year. We, like Lauren called out, both these expenses, the wage rate pressure as well as the freight pressure that we saw in Q1 was more in line with our internal expectation, what we thought was there will be some normalization, which we are not expecting right now in the back half. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Warren Cheng at Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: I just wanted to ask about your confidence that the majority of the merchandise margin rate expansion is sustainable. So you've talked about some of these tools you've developed to surgically adjust pricing. You've developed some new clearance concepts. Have these tools and concepts been tested in an inventory clearance environment? So as in 1Q, as some of the pandemic winter categories normalize, were there pockets of inventory or situations where you actually had to clear inventories because it hasn't really happened much in the last couple of years? And if so, can you just talk about the -- how some of these tools are changing the realizations that you're getting on these excess inventories? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Warren. We have -- we didn't have a substantial amount of clearance with some of those normalized categories that you're referencing because, as I said before, we are going to buy around healthy, good inventory. So it doesn't -- it's not like we started marking things down. That said, our clearance levels are really, really healthy and improved. And that's partly because of our digital marketing tools and the fact that we can be very surgical. We've moved away from any sort of site-wide and store-wide offers to much more specifically targeted either personalized offers or category-led offers.\n And then we are having a lot of success with our Going, Going, Gone! concept, where we can get clearance products, both out of the DICK'S store so that we can bring new fresh product in there, but also in Going, Going, Gone! Once we've consolidated the clearance, we can offer it online easier because we don't have safety stock issues at higher prices without having to let it sort of sit for a long, long time. So generally speaking, our tools are really strong. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, I'll add one more color to what Lauren said. Back to your initial part of the question, which is the confidence that we can hold on to the vast majorities. Again, if you think back to 2019, hunt's penetration has significantly gone down. The vertical brand penetration has significantly gone up and vertical brands, just to remind, 600 to 800 basis points higher margin rate as well as our approach to marketing has significantly changed. So we no longer are doing big promotions that we used to do back in 2019. And those are all structural capabilities that we have developed over the last 3 years that give us tremendous confidence in addition to kind of the price optimization capabilities we have built. \nWarren Cheng: That's very helpful. And my follow-up is, are you seeing any evidence of trade down, either the private brands are doing really well? Are you seeing those private brands take share from national brands or new customers coming in? Just any thoughts on trade-down behavior that you might have observed in the first quarter. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. I don't think that would be an accurate thing to say that we're watching trade down. I actually think in some ways, it's notable that our Gold customer penetration has actually increased, and our sales from that group have been positive, which is evidence, I think, of the fact that people are still spending on categories that are important to them and the fact that our assortment has become so much more premium and attractive and high heat.\n At the same time though, at the opening price point, we have -- we've been having success with things like DSG brand, it's accelerated. But I don't think that -- I wouldn't view that as a trade down. I just think it's the right product for this time in people's lives right now. So it's kind of a bifurcated answer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser at Williams Trading. \nSamuel Poser: I have 2. One is on the prior guidance you gave, I mean, you sort of gave real direction on the overall gross margin and SG&A. You said that SG&A would likely lever versus '19 by 150 bps. And I think around 640 bps, the gross margin would end up above '19. So could you update those numbers for us? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Sam. I think our -- I think we have given an appropriate level of guidance today and so I won't go into the details. And maybe if there are modeling questions, we can take that off-line. But I would say that there are three big drivers, just to reiterate, as we talk about the updated guidance, especially when it came to profitability.\n The first and foremost is the currently updated expectations for the top line range. So that's been contemplated. The freight pressures just -- and supply chain pressures, which kind of sit between -- which sits primarily in our gross profit line. And then the wage pressure, which if you think about it, is predominantly in our store labor line and that will be on an SG&A line. So that's being contemplated. Potentially, there are other inflationary pressures as well, but we have taken some actions as part of the revised guidance that are kind of offsetting the pressures that we are seeing in other lines. \nSamuel Poser: And then during the crisis, you guys did a good job of sort of adjusting to better face your consumers and we're able to internally overcome a lot of the macro craziness that's going on. This is a little bit different coming the other way. What are -- I understand you're sort of being prudent about what could happen. But I guess the question I have is what are the -- what are you doing to sort of raise your own game to overcome these macro pressures that you would -- that caused you to adjust your guidance? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Sam, I will agree with you that I think our team did an incredible job managing through crisis, and we found a few things about our business. One is that we have somewhat of a -- maybe an overstatement, but a natural hedge within our business, such that when people stop playing team sports in that case, they still wanted to get outside with their families. And so we saw other businesses increase. And then similarly, when people started to go back onto the field, you see those businesses normalize. So generally speaking, I think we're in a great lane in terms of the products that we carry.\n We are being prudent. Looking forward, we just -- the consumer is going through an awful lot right now. And frankly, it's getting more challenging every single day. And so we will work like heck to pull every lever that we have to drive sales and to manage expenses, and you can expect us to do that. But we want to be appropriately cautious, given how rapidly some costs are accelerating and that the consumer is really in a very challenged state right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Baker at D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Two questions. One, just on the comp, it's fair to say that the new guidance range down -- I think it was down 2% to down 8%. That does anticipate some change in the consumer environment because you're not seeing it yet. But again, I guess you're saying in your guidance, you are assuming some of it, but the second part of that question is, I presume that you still -- you are still running within your previous guidance of 5% to down 4%, because you're not seeing any change, you're just taking it down based on what you think might -- or being cautious on what could happen. Is that the right interpretation of the change in the top line? \nLauren Hobart: Michael, I think you said it perfectly. That is exactly that our new guidance anticipates, that there's a lot of things that we can't control going forward. But we are still operating and expect -- within our guidance range on the comp side is absolutely our old guidance, and we are expecting to -- everything we can control, we feel really, really positive about. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Yes. That makes sense. One other question, if I could ask specifically about the golf business. I think you said quickly in there at one point that, that business wasn't as strong. And maybe that was weather related, but you had anticipated that. I guess what's your outlook for the golf business for the year? If there was a weather impact, now that the weather seems to have gotten a little bit better, do we expect that business to get better? Just curious how you're thinking about that category. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Golf is a category that we think has tremendous growth in the long term. Rounds played are still really, really strong. The new consumers who have come into the game have not dropped it and are buying new products. So I think there's going to be some normalization, which we expected. The weather shifts don't bother me at all because that happens every year, one either snowing in December or maybe snowing in April, I don't know. But long term, we have a lot of confidence in the golf business. \nMichael Baker: Makes sense. And I'll just say your Golf Galaxy offering, the club fitting, I took advantage of that, tremendous offer. Appreciate it. \nLauren Hobart: Michael, wonderful. Thank you. We appreciate that. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan at Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: So from what we're hearing from a lot of the softline vendors, apparel footwear vendors, the athletic brands, there's plans for an acceleration and in some cases, a meaningful acceleration in their North American businesses as we get into the back half of the year. Can you talk to that opportunity and what you're seeing in that market? How you're buying to that trend as we get into the back half? \nLauren Hobart: John, we do see and we guided originally to the fact that we think the year is going to start off -- sequentially accelerate as the year goes on. I mentioned in my remarks that softlines, in particular on the apparel side, have had some supply chain challenges and that we're bullish as we look at more back-to-school in the rest of the year. So I think the consumer is there and the product is good, and we are absolutely buying into these trends. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. And then maybe just on the -- if we look at the high end and the low end of guidance, the down 8% to down 2% and then the $9.15 to $11.70 on EPS, what do you think is the biggest swing factor in the guidance, both from a sales and margin standpoint? What gets you to the high end? And what's the scenario where we're more towards the low end from a macro standpoint? Go ahead. \nNavdeep Gupta: John, I would say the biggest overriding factor is comp sales. The -- if we continue to see that the consumer is holding up well, and we are not -- and it's not getting impacted by this cumulative impact of inflation, gas prices, commodity prices increasing, if the consumer continues to hold well, that, to me, would be a good indication of how our business will do. And so to me, that is the biggest factor that we are looking into. The cost, yes, we know those will continue to remain elevated. Those have already been incorporated. And so the biggest factor is going to be the top line expectations. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up there. When you look at -- simplistically look at inventory growth on the balance sheet on a dollar basis versus where we are from a top line growth perspective, pretty much across the industry, what gives you such confidence that we're not going to be over-inventoried into the back half of the year right now? And this goes to the vendors and the retailers, inventory is clearly trending above sales trends at this point. \nLauren Hobart: Go ahead, Navdeep. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I think to me, this is where -- on the confidence that our merchandising team come from and the supply chain team. They have a very good pulse on the business, and we have perfected this art on -- as we called out at the beginning of the last 2 years on the upside, and we are very, very careful about thinking about different scenarios, what are the potential, where are the categories where the business could be impacted. And as you expect, that we are doing all of these internal evaluations a lot, discussing about different scenarios. And to me, the confidence that we have in our team is probably the biggest indicator of the overall confidence that we have on our inventory position. Yes. \nLauren Hobart: And I think the fact that wherever we are -- where we are right now, the inventory is not toxic. We don't plan to create any level of risk with toxicity, and we can manage through and buy around any inventory we have. So this does not concern us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Feldman at Telsey Advisory Group LLC. \nJoseph Feldman: I want to go back to -- on the gross margin line, I know we've talked about merch margin a lot, but you actually mentioned that occupancy costs deleveraged quite a bit. And I just was curious as to what drove that. Was it simply just the sales? Or are you actually seeing rents going up? Or was there incremental pressure related to the real estate side of things? \nNavdeep Gupta: No, Joe, it's all driven by sales. So -- and at a minus 8.5% comp and 7.5% sales decline, it's all being driven by sales decline. To answer your question, the flexibility that we have in our real estate portfolio and the strength that we have in terms of our financial performance and the strong balance sheet, we actually feel really good about the opportunity that we have to be able to drive more efficiencies in our occupancy costs. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. That's great to hear. And then kind of a bigger picture question I had was, as you think -- or as we all start to think about what's the right level of operating profit going forward or operating margin, EBIT margin, if you will, I mean, how should we think about that? I think we all agree it's probably not going back to pre-COVID levels. It's also probably not going to be at the peak of last year, 16.5%. But 3 months ago, we all thought it was going to be more like 13-ish, and now we're thinking it's 10-ish. So I'm just kind of curious if you can give us any kind of help around that to think about the future? \nOperator: Thank you, everybody. Unfortunately, we lost connection with the speakers. [Operator Instructions] \n [Technical Difficulty]\n Hello, everybody. We have the connection with the speakers again. Please continue the Q&A. \nNavdeep Gupta: Joe, this is Navdeep. I don't know where we got dropped off. I'll try to probably rephrase the last part of my sentence. Basically, what we are saying is that structurally, there's nothing that we believe is going to hold us back from achieving kind of the profitability levels that we saw in 2021. What -- the thing that is at play is the macroeconomic conditions. So to me, that's the piece that we will continue to look to. And structurally, our merchandising margin is really strong, our e-commerce business continues to be really strong, and it's very profitable. So structurally, when you think about it, we are very optimistic about the long-term sales and the profitability of our business. \nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to pass back over to Lauren Hobart, President and CEO, for any final remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you, and thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. We apologize for some of the technical glitches on this call, but hopefully, you were able to hear the confidence that we have in our business. We look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results as our team continued to move with agility and execute well in a highly dynamic environment. Before diving into the results of the quarter, I think it's important to recognize that over the past 2 years, we have demonstrated our ability to adeptly manage through the pandemic and other challenges and we are confident in our continued ability to adapt quickly and execute through uncertain macroeconomic conditions, while keeping our athletes at the heart of every decision we make. \n With that context, I do want to take a moment to address the adjustments we made to our 2022 outlook this morning. Like everyone else, we have been carefully monitoring the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and assessing our expectations based on our experience running our business across economic cycles. With this perspective, we believe it's appropriate to be cautious and are, therefore, lowering our outlook for the year. \n To be clear, we expect our performance will continue to meaningfully exceed 2019 levels, reflecting the strength of our core strategies and the changes we've made in our business over the past 5 years. DICK'S is the clear market leader, and we are well positioned to extend our lead and build on our competitive advantages in the years ahead. We continue to closely watch the macro landscape and have the flexibility in our business to remain nimble. \n Now getting back to our results. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered sales of $2.7 billion in the first quarter. This included a comparable store sales decline of 8.4%, which followed a 117% increase in comp sales in the same period of the prior year. This also reflected the anniversary of significant stimulus payments as well as anticipated sales normalization in certain categories. \n Importantly, sales continued to run substantially above pre-COVID levels, up 41% versus Q1 2019 and sequentially accelerated from last quarter. These top line results reinforce our strong conviction that the shift in consumer behavior over the past 2 years is indeed structural. Consumers have made lasting lifestyle changes, with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in sports and outdoor activities. Our business is squarely at the center of these secular trends and the actions we have taken over the past 5 years to transform our company have given us significant competitive advantages across all aspects of our business. \n Our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined and more sophisticated promotional strategies, continues to drive strong merchandise margin growth. During the quarter, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 143 basis points versus 2021. \n Before continuing, let me underscore this critical point that is not always appreciated about our transformation. The content of the product that we carry today is very different from the products we carried 5 years ago. It's higher heat and more narrowly distributed than what you'll find in the market as a whole, and therefore, it is not as susceptible to promotion. In addition, the tools we have today to surgically adjust pricing are significantly more sophisticated than they were several years ago. With these fundamental changes, we are very confident that the majority of our merchandise margin rate expansion that we've driven over the past 2 years is sustainable. \n Led by our structurally higher sales and merchandise margin compared to pre-COVID levels, we achieved double-digit EBT margin of over 12% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85, both significantly ahead of any pre-COVID first quarter in our history. We entered 2022 in a position of tremendous strength and we're focused on enhancing our existing strategy to further strengthen our core business and drive long-term profitable growth. \n Our approach is centered on our best-in-class omnichannel platform, which features our stores as a hub. During the first quarter, our stores enabled over 90% of total sales, serving both our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for omnichannel fulfillment through ship from store, in-store pickup or curbside. We also continue to invest in an enhanced service model and lean into highly engaging experiences to better serve our athletes and reinforce their loyalty. \n Our digital capabilities remain core to our omnichannel success and we are continuing to prioritize investments in technology and data science. Furthermore, we remain focused on maintaining our strong culture, putting our teammates, athletes and communities at the center of everything we do. This work continues to have a positive impact, as we were recently awarded back-to-back annual certification by Great Place to Work. I spend a lot of time visiting our stores and distribution centers and the positive energy and sense of community from the teams I meet is fantastic. Our strong dedicated team and our ability to attract and retain talent are key competitive advantages for us. \n Next, within merchandising, our relationships with key brands remain stronger than ever. Our assortment is on trend and we are providing our athletes with enhanced access to the hottest styles across a wide range of categories from the top brands in sports. Importantly, we also are ensuring that we have products at prices that address the needs of all athletes. For example, through DSG, our largest vertical brand, we offer high-quality, fashion-forward product at a tremendous value across men's, women's and youth. Our key lifestyle vertical brands, including CALIA and VRST, are also resonating strongly with our athletes and we continue to invest in and grow these brands. \n Lastly, our new concepts, including DICK'S House of Sport, Golf Galaxy Performance Center, Public Lands and Going, Going, Gone!, are delivering promising early results. Today, we are really excited to open our third House of Sport store in Minnetonka, Minnesota. House of Sport has exceeded our expectations and has been a great example of the power of elevated service, community engagement and merchandise presentations. We look forward to continuing to refine and grow these concepts, while pulling key learnings into our core DICK'S and Golf Galaxy chains. \n In closing, we remain confident in our strategies and our ability to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth. DICK'S has a unique and powerful position in the marketplace. Sports and an active lifestyle are important in all times and now more than ever as we help families get outside together and lead active and healthy lives. Our teammates are united behind our common purpose, which is to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams, especially during these times of uncertainty. \n Before concluding, I want to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Navdeep to review our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Simeon. It's Lauren. I think those are all very important questions, and I'll try and parse them all out and answer all of them. We have had, as you know, a fantastic, a very good Q1. We're pleased with our Q1. And we had anticipated increases in our freight cost, in our labor costs and in our product costs as we went into the quarter and we were accurate in our forecasting of those expenses.\n There's 2 things that have changed that are driving our approach to the guidance for the rest of the quarter. First is that the consumer is going through an awful lot right now. So obviously, macroeconomic trends are challenging, inflation is putting pressure on the consumer at the gas pump and in grocery store, we all know. And then there's this geopolitical environment that is very, very challenging. At the same time, we see that the expenses of those 3 line items, so freight, labor and perhaps product input costs, are accelerating more quickly than we had anticipated. And so we want to be appropriately cautious as we look forward to the year.\n However, I want to be very clear that we are not seeing any meaningful trends that are different from what we saw in Q1 and we believe our inventory at plus 40% actually is very healthy and we are very pleased with it. In fact, there are areas where if we could have more, we would have more. There's been some disruption in terms of when inventory is flowing in. But we had anticipated that certain categories, like fitness and outdoor equipment would normalize this year. And they have normalized as we expected. We are still chasing products in certain categories and our inventory is healthy. We are not anticipating any significant markdown risk.\n To answer your other question, our -- the promotional environment, we are not seeing a change in the promotional environment. We will obviously continue to monitor that and we will be surgically addressing price changes as we absorb some of the cost increases. But the marketplace has not shifted dramatically in any meaningful way. We are just being appropriately cautious as we look toward a lot of things that are outside of our control when we look at the rest of the year. Yes. Across the board, you're absolutely right. If you look at the last 2 years and look at the consumer, every single category in our business has -- virtually everyone except for hunt, has rebaseline meaningfully higher than our pre-pandemic volume. And that reflects the fact that the consumer is outdoors more. They are running, they are walking, they are playing golf. The pandemic-surging categories that we've all been talking about and we expected to normalize are fitness, outdoor equipment, which will include things like bikes and paddles and golf. And those 3 normalize as we expected them to normalize, but we believe they all have long-term growth potential.\n So we are not changing our outlook on any aspect of our business. We actually think in these types of times, people need to get outside. They need to be active. They want to be with their families, and we are well positioned to serve the needs of these athletes. Yes. So our partnership with Nike is at an all-time high, as is our partnership with all of our strategic partners. And I think that's a result, not just of a situational moment in time with certain partners, but the fact that we have invested so much in our stores and in our experience, such that brands who are rooted in sport want to actually showcase their product and their brand in our stores.\n So yes, across the board, we are getting access to higher heat and more pristine premier product that's high in consumer demand. And that's a big part of our strategy, and that has been driving our results. Yes. Kate, we -- it's Lauren. We had -- we did not see a significant weather impact in any of the key categories, certainly didn't drive any markdown behavior. The main category that experienced an impact from the colder and wetter spring was golf. But as I said, that met our expectations of normalizing. Yes. Robby, I just want to build on one thing, which is that our merch margin forecast going forward still assumes, even in the new guidance, that we are going to maintain the majority of our merch margin gains over the past few years. Yes. Paul, our vertical brand did extremely well in Q1. And I would point specifically to how pleased we are with the DSG line, and the fact that, that does provide an opening price point with really wonderful fashion is doing incredibly well, as is our new VRST line and our CALIA line. So really, really pleased. And there's not an area I can point to where I think vertical brands are not gaining share across the business.\n From an apparel and footwear performance standpoint in the quarter, footwear did really, really well for all the reasons that we've been talking about and inventory in that category is good. And again, if we could chase more, we would chase more. On the apparel side, we did have some inventory challenges during the quarter, just making sure that we have the right product, the right season product in stock. But we are planning to buy around anything that came in late, so it's not a markdown risk for us, and we believe that by back-to-school apparel should be getting better. I'll start off and pass it over to Navdeep to answer your last question. I want to be -- I want to clarify one thing. We have passed some input cost pressures on to consumers, specifically in hardlines, a little bit in softlines, but we have not been passing through all of our input cost pressures. We have been benefiting from some of our improved assortment, our mix and the fact that we're not promotional. So our merch margins are not reflecting the -- even though they're so strong, it's not reflecting the fact that we've passed 100% of the cost forward.\n Now as we look to the future, if costs continue to increase at an accelerated rate, we may have to start passing higher cost increases on. And at that point, we're going to be down at the really specific data-driven pricing optimized level in terms of what the consumer will bear versus what our margin will absorb. And so I just want to clarify that. And then Navdeep, if you can answer the latter part of the question. Yes. Thanks, Warren. We have -- we didn't have a substantial amount of clearance with some of those normalized categories that you're referencing because, as I said before, we are going to buy around healthy, good inventory. So it doesn't -- it's not like we started marking things down. That said, our clearance levels are really, really healthy and improved. And that's partly because of our digital marketing tools and the fact that we can be very surgical. We've moved away from any sort of site-wide and store-wide offers to much more specifically targeted either personalized offers or category-led offers.\n And then we are having a lot of success with our Going, Going, Gone! concept, where we can get clearance products, both out of the DICK'S store so that we can bring new fresh product in there, but also in Going, Going, Gone! Once we've consolidated the clearance, we can offer it online easier because we don't have safety stock issues at higher prices without having to let it sort of sit for a long, long time. So generally speaking, our tools are really strong. Yes. I don't think that would be an accurate thing to say that we're watching trade down. I actually think in some ways, it's notable that our Gold customer penetration has actually increased, and our sales from that group have been positive, which is evidence, I think, of the fact that people are still spending on categories that are important to them and the fact that our assortment has become so much more premium and attractive and high heat.\n At the same time though, at the opening price point, we have -- we've been having success with things like DSG brand, it's accelerated. But I don't think that -- I wouldn't view that as a trade down. I just think it's the right product for this time in people's lives right now. So it's kind of a bifurcated answer. Yes. Sam, I will agree with you that I think our team did an incredible job managing through crisis, and we found a few things about our business. One is that we have somewhat of a -- maybe an overstatement, but a natural hedge within our business, such that when people stop playing team sports in that case, they still wanted to get outside with their families. And so we saw other businesses increase. And then similarly, when people started to go back onto the field, you see those businesses normalize. So generally speaking, I think we're in a great lane in terms of the products that we carry.\n We are being prudent. Looking forward, we just -- the consumer is going through an awful lot right now. And frankly, it's getting more challenging every single day. And so we will work like heck to pull every lever that we have to drive sales and to manage expenses, and you can expect us to do that. But we want to be appropriately cautious, given how rapidly some costs are accelerating and that the consumer is really in a very challenged state right now. Michael, I think you said it perfectly. That is exactly that our new guidance anticipates, that there's a lot of things that we can't control going forward. But we are still operating and expect -- within our guidance range on the comp side is absolutely our old guidance, and we are expecting to -- everything we can control, we feel really, really positive about. Yes. Golf is a category that we think has tremendous growth in the long term. Rounds played are still really, really strong. The new consumers who have come into the game have not dropped it and are buying new products. So I think there's going to be some normalization, which we expected. The weather shifts don't bother me at all because that happens every year, one either snowing in December or maybe snowing in April, I don't know. But long term, we have a lot of confidence in the golf business. Michael, wonderful. Thank you. We appreciate that. Thank you. John, we do see and we guided originally to the fact that we think the year is going to start off -- sequentially accelerate as the year goes on. I mentioned in my remarks that softlines, in particular on the apparel side, have had some supply chain challenges and that we're bullish as we look at more back-to-school in the rest of the year. So I think the consumer is there and the product is good, and we are absolutely buying into these trends. Go ahead, Navdeep. And I think the fact that wherever we are -- where we are right now, the inventory is not toxic. We don't plan to create any level of risk with toxicity, and we can manage through and buy around any inventory we have. So this does not concern us. Thank you, and thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. We apologize for some of the technical glitches on this call, but hopefully, you were able to hear the confidence that we have in our business. We look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. Consolidated sales decreased 7.5% to approximately $2.7 billion. Comparable store sales decreased 8.4% following a 117% increase in comp sales in the same period last year. As Lauren indicated, comps were impacted as we anniversaried significant stimulus payments from the prior year quarter. And in addition, we saw the anticipated sales normalization in certain categories that surged throughout the pandemic. And as part of this year-over-year anniversary, transactions declined by 6.4% and average ticket declined by 2%. \n Importantly, our sales continue to run significantly above pre-COVID levels. Compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 41% and sequentially accelerated from the most recent quarter. Gross profit in the first quarter was $984.7 million or 36.7% of net sales and declined 83 basis points versus last year. This decline was driven by 103 basis points increase in supply chain-related costs and a deleverage on fixed occupancy cost of 94 basis points from the sales decrease. These items were partially offset by continued merchandise margin rate expansion. For the quarter, merchandise margin increased 143 basis points as we continue to see the benefits from our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined and more sophisticated promotional strategies and clearance pricing. We also saw favorable sales mix. \n SG&A expenses were $615.3 million or 22.79% of net sales and deleveraged 195 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to the decrease in sales. The increase in SG&A expense dollar is driven by our investment in advertising and hourly wage rates. These items were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and $17 million of income associated with changes in the investment values of our deferred compensation plans, which is fully offset by the investment loss recognized in other expense line. In addition, SG&A also included approximately $13 million of COVID-related safety costs in the prior year quarter. \n Driven by our structurally higher sales and merchandise margin compared to pre-COVID levels, EBT was $331.9 million or 12.29% of net sales. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.79 last year and $0.62 in 2019. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and cash equivalent and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 40% compared to Q1 of last year, with product flow improving as the quarter progressed. Looking ahead, we feel good about our overall inventory levels for Q2 and are prepared to continue navigating a dynamic global supply chain environment through the rest of the year. \n Turning to our first quarter capital allocations, net capital expenditures were $53.9 million and we paid $46.1 million in quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we exchanged $100 million at approximately 17% of the outstanding principle of our convertible senior notes for cash and unwound the corresponding portion of convertible note hedge and warrants for 1.8 million shares of our common stock. Following this exchange, we have approximately $475 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding. We also repurchased 417,000 shares of our stock for $42 million at an average price of $101.39. \n Now let me wrap up with our outlook for 2022. We are pleased with the start of our year and continue to see meaningful growth above 2019 levels. However, as Lauren mentioned, we have been carefully monitoring the economic environment and there are many puts and takes at play. With an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, geopolitical environment and a dynamic global supply chain, we believe it is prudent to adopt an appropriately cautious outlook for the year. Thus, we are adjusting our 2022 guidance range. \n For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $9.15 to $11.70 and a comparable store sales in the range of negative 8% to negative 2%. EBT is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.35 billion, with EBT margins expected to be approximately 10% at the midpoint. This includes additional risk in supply chain-related costs and higher wage rates as well as greater than originally anticipated normalization of promotional landscape over the balance of the year. As a reminder, this also includes approximately $55 million of pretax interest expense associated with our $1.5 billion long-term debt. \n Our earnings guidance assumes an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%, and is based on an approximately 88 million average diluted shares outstanding. In addition, our plan now includes a minimum of $300 million of share repurchases, the effect of which is included in our EPS guidance. Importantly, we are continuing to invest in our business for long term, and for the year, expect the net capital expenditure of $340 million to $365 million. \n In closing, we are pleased with the results of our first quarter. And while we recognize we are in an uncertain economic environment, DICK'S is a clear market leader, and we remain structurally stronger and more profitable company today compared to pre-COVID. And at the midpoint of our updated outlook, we expect sales to increase approximately 35% versus 2019 and EBT margin of approximately 10%, doubling our 2019 EBT rate. Our financial position is strong, ending Q1 with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to drive sales and profitability growth over the long term. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yes. Adrienne, maybe before I go into the details, I think one of the ways to think about the inventory is to also look at what was happening to our inventory position as we were going through 2021. If you look at it, as we called out last year, our inventory position continued to build as we went into the year. So what you're comparing Q1 versus Q1 last year, especially our inventory starts and in-stock levels last year in... Yes. Sorry, I'll start back again. So we apologize. I don't know what happened on the line here. We were -- we seem to be connected here at our end and somehow lost the connection. So Adrienne, back to your question, the way we are looking at inventory. We are looking at inventory trends versus 2019 internally because as we talked about in 2021, our inventory levels were building through the year. So the better comparison for inventory is compared to 2019. So our sales are up 41%. Our inventory is up 32%.\n In terms of the balance between in transit as well as unit versus the prices, I would say, yes, we have a little bit elevated levels of in-transit inventory, not necessarily associated with buying the product ahead for the balance of the year. It's much more of -- to do with the product that we expected to receive in Q1 that is slightly delayed. So that's the reason we have a little bit of elevated levels of in-transit inventory. And it's a balance between unit increase versus AUR increases. Yes. Kate, we haven't given the details on that one. But the way -- the easiest way to think about it is it's a combination. Yes, as you expected and as you called out, that as the COVID surge in categories like fitness and the outdoor equipment normalize, that does put a little bit of a pressure on the ticket size, and that is balanced against the overall AUR increases, inflation related that we have seen. So Robert, that was a very in-depth question. Maybe I'll begin with the last question. So one, we're not giving an inter-quarter guidance here. So what we -- the sentiment that Lauren called out is that we are not seeing a material change in the trends of the business. It has much more to do with the customer and not trying to imply anything in terms of the expectations for Q2.\n So I'll address 3 big questions that you asked. One is the kind of what is our implied midpoint expectations on the sales. Like Lauren said, Q1, we were pleased with our Q1 performance. The business reaccelerated versus 2019 and especially if you look at where we finished in Q4. So we feel really good about the trends of the business and the core categories in Q1. And like Lauren called out again, like we're not seeing a meaningful change in the trajectory of the business in the month of May.\n The takedown in our guidance on the top line expectation is purely coming out of we being appropriately cautious about the outlook on what is happening in kind of the overall economic landscape. The pressure that our consumer and the consumer in general has is something that we wanted to not ignore and wanted to address that upfront. And that has been kind of included in our sales guidance.\n As we think about the other 2 elements that we called out, we have -- we anticipated that the freight expenses would be elevated. There will be inflation as well as there will be wage pressures. But what we are seeing is that these costs have gotten more pronounced in the last 3 months since we gave the original guidance. The fuel prices continue to remain elevated as well as are continuing to go up. So we wanted to acknowledge these risks that we are seeing from a cost structure perspective and we incorporated that in our guidance.\n And the last piece, like we called out, right, we anticipated, again, a little bit of normalization of the promotions in the back half of the year. And now we feel that there may be a higher propensity of the promotions in the back half of the year. Again, we are not seeing anything. It's just being cautious about the overall economic landscape and kind of anticipating what might be happening. And potentially, as Lauren called out, we may be seeing -- we are seeing some increase in input costs. And we may decide not to pass all of those costs to our athletes as well, just trying to do the right thing between the athlete as well as the long-term potential of our business. So that is the third piece that has been contemplated into our guidance. Yes. Chris, I think there are 2 ways to think about it. Like if you compare it versus -- in fourth quarter of last year, we had called out that we were not promotional. So when you -- and considering how promotional fourth quarter typically is, that benefit was included in our Q4 expectation. We are very pleased with the performance that we have seen from the merchandise margin expansion, especially when you look at it compared to 2019. \n Like Lauren called out, we expect to be able to maintain a vast majority of the merchandise margin gains that we have seen over the last 2 years into this year, and that has been contemplated in our guidance as well. We do anticipate that the promotional landscape will not remain as benign as it has been for the last few years. But our expectation is also not that the promotional landscape goes back to where it used to be pre-COVID levels. So it's somewhere -- it's going to be landing somewhere between the 2, and that's the piece that we will continue to watch out. Exactly. Q1 is not as promotional of a quarter as you typically expect, right, compared to fourth quarter. And that's kind of -- we still were able to expand our merchandise margin, even when compared to Q1 of 2021. And when you look at the merchandise margin expansion versus 2019, we are very pleased with the trajectory that we are holding. Yes. I would say there are -- the biggest one is freight, no questions about it. There are 2 pieces, fuel is what we called out as well as like when you think of the fixed expenses and the deleverage that you get when you have a negative 8.5% comp, that is also included. But the vast majority, I would say, was driven by the freight pressures that we saw.\n Maybe -- sorry, I'll add to this, that this was not a surprise to us. When you look at that decline, it was more of a year-over-year. We, like Lauren called out, both these expenses, the wage rate pressure as well as the freight pressure that we saw in Q1 was more in line with our internal expectation, what we thought was there will be some normalization, which we are not expecting right now in the back half. Yes. Warren, I'll add one more color to what Lauren said. Back to your initial part of the question, which is the confidence that we can hold on to the vast majorities. Again, if you think back to 2019, hunt's penetration has significantly gone down. The vertical brand penetration has significantly gone up and vertical brands, just to remind, 600 to 800 basis points higher margin rate as well as our approach to marketing has significantly changed. So we no longer are doing big promotions that we used to do back in 2019. And those are all structural capabilities that we have developed over the last 3 years that give us tremendous confidence in addition to kind of the price optimization capabilities we have built. Yes, Sam. I think our -- I think we have given an appropriate level of guidance today and so I won't go into the details. And maybe if there are modeling questions, we can take that off-line. But I would say that there are three big drivers, just to reiterate, as we talk about the updated guidance, especially when it came to profitability.\n The first and foremost is the currently updated expectations for the top line range. So that's been contemplated. The freight pressures just -- and supply chain pressures, which kind of sit between -- which sits primarily in our gross profit line. And then the wage pressure, which if you think about it, is predominantly in our store labor line and that will be on an SG&A line. So that's being contemplated. Potentially, there are other inflationary pressures as well, but we have taken some actions as part of the revised guidance that are kind of offsetting the pressures that we are seeing in other lines. John, I would say the biggest overriding factor is comp sales. The -- if we continue to see that the consumer is holding up well, and we are not -- and it's not getting impacted by this cumulative impact of inflation, gas prices, commodity prices increasing, if the consumer continues to hold well, that, to me, would be a good indication of how our business will do. And so to me, that is the biggest factor that we are looking into. The cost, yes, we know those will continue to remain elevated. Those have already been incorporated. And so the biggest factor is going to be the top line expectations. Yes. I think to me, this is where -- on the confidence that our merchandising team come from and the supply chain team. They have a very good pulse on the business, and we have perfected this art on -- as we called out at the beginning of the last 2 years on the upside, and we are very, very careful about thinking about different scenarios, what are the potential, where are the categories where the business could be impacted. And as you expect, that we are doing all of these internal evaluations a lot, discussing about different scenarios. And to me, the confidence that we have in our team is probably the biggest indicator of the overall confidence that we have on our inventory position. Yes. No, Joe, it's all driven by sales. So -- and at a minus 8.5% comp and 7.5% sales decline, it's all being driven by sales decline. To answer your question, the flexibility that we have in our real estate portfolio and the strength that we have in terms of our financial performance and the strong balance sheet, we actually feel really good about the opportunity that we have to be able to drive more efficiencies in our occupancy costs. Joe, this is Navdeep. I don't know where we got dropped off. I'll try to probably rephrase the last part of my sentence. Basically, what we are saying is that structurally, there's nothing that we believe is going to hold us back from achieving kind of the profitability levels that we saw in 2021. What -- the thing that is at play is the macroeconomic conditions. So to me, that's the piece that we will continue to look to. And structurally, our merchandising margin is really strong, our e-commerce business continues to be really strong, and it's very profitable. So structurally, when you think about it, we are very optimistic about the long-term sales and the profitability of our business."

Fourth quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. On today's call will be Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived on our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months.  \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q, as well as cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call.  \n And finally, a few admin items. First, a reminder about our comparable store sales reporting for fiscal 2023. It's important to note that fiscal 2023 was a 53-week year. Our comp sales calculations exclude the extra week from both our full year 2023 and fourth quarter 2023 results. Thus, these metrics have been calculated on a 52-week and 13-week comparable basis.  \n Second, beginning in fiscal 2024, we are revising our comparable store sales calculations to include revenue from our GameChanger business.  \n Next, we'll be playing a short year-end video in advance of our prepared remarks. And starting toward the end of Navdeep's prepared remarks, we'll also be sharing slides to visually support key discussion points. \n And finally, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our first quarter 2024 earnings results on May 29, 2024. \n With that, let's play the video.  \n [Presentation] \nLauren Hobart: Good morning, everyone. I hope you enjoyed the video. DICK'S is a really special company with 75 years of history reinventing sport. It's been a terrific year, and I'm really proud of the team for their extraordinary efforts.\n Since our founding in 1948, DICK'S had believed in the power of sports to change lives. We bring this to life every day through the experience we provide for our athletes; the differentiated products we offer; the marketing we create to connect our athletes deeply with our brand; and most importantly, our teammates. Through these strategic pillars, we are actively creating and defining our future. And during this past year, it's evident just how far we've extended our leadership position.  \n For the full year, we delivered record sales of $13 billion. On a 52-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.4%, driven by growth in transactions as we continue to gain market share. We added nearly 7 million new athletes during the year and reached record highs in our active athlete database. It's clear that sport and leading healthy, active lifestyles are priorities for our athletes, and they are increasingly looking to DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet these needs.  \n With our industry-leading assortment and strong execution, we capped off the year with incredibly strong fourth quarter and holiday season. Including week 53, our quarterly sales grew 7.8% to $3.9 billion. On a 13-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.8%, which was on top of a 5.3% comp increase last year. \n On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin expanded more than 200 basis points, driven by higher merchandise margin. Our non-GAAP EBT margin was 11%. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $3.85, which included $0.19 for the extra week. On a 13-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.  \n For 2024, we're guiding to another strong year and expect to grow both our sales and earnings through positive comps, higher merchandise margin and productivity gains. Our inventory is well positioned, and we're excited about the assortment we have curated for our athletes. We expect our comp sales to be in the range of 1% to 2% and expect our EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $13.25.  \n We're excited to continue redefining the future of retail. With the continued success of our growth initiatives, we will increase our capital investment to drive our business forward, both digitally and in store, and continue gaining market share in this fragmented $140 billion industry. \n A key driver of this growth is the repositioning of our portfolio, including House of Sport, our next-generation 50,000, which completely revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot DICK'S store; and Golf Galaxy Performance Center. Navdeep will share greater detail on House of Sport's compelling unit economics.  \n I'd like to thank all our teammates for delivering another strong year and for their passion, hard work and dedication to our business. At DICK'S, it's our people who make us great, and none of what we accomplished is possible without our exceptional team.  \n Before I go deeper into our growth strategies, I'll first turn the call over to Navdeep to share more detail on our financial results, 2024 outlook and capital allocation. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with some highlights of our full year 2023 results, which was a 53-week year. Consolidated sales increased 5% to $12.98 billion, which included $170 million from the 53rd week. On a 52-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.4%, and we continue to gain market share. Our comps were driven by a 1.6% increase in transaction and a 0.8% increase in average ticket. \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit for the full year was $4.55 billion or 35.01% of net sales, an increase of 36 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by lower supply chain costs, which leveraged 80 basis points. This was partially offset by lower merchandise margin of 53 basis points, which was entirely due to higher shrink. To be clear, absent the headwind from shrink, our merchandise margin would have been flat. . \n Non-GAAP EBT was $1.4 billion or 10.8% of net sales, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.91, which included $0.19 from the 53rd week. On a 52-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $12.72. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.04 in 2022, an increase of 5.6% on a 52- to 52-week basis.  \n I will remind you that our 2023 tax rate was lower than our typical tax rate driven by the favorable impact of vesting of employee equity awards and exercises during the year. This positively impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.44 compared to the prior year.  \n As we have discussed on our prior calls, to continue fueling our long-term growth, during the second half of 2023, we took actions to better align our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most critical strategies while also streamlining our overall cost structure. This included actions to change our resourcing and organizational structure, primarily at our customer support center, as well as the optimization of our outdoor specialty business.  \n As part of this, we integrated operations of Moosejaw into Public Lands and made decisions about the go-forward outdoor inventory assortment consistent with our prior expectations. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of our store portfolio with respect to our outdoor specialty business. \n We completed our business optimization review during the fourth quarter. In total, we incurred pretax charges of $84.8 million for the full year 2023. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.18. For additional details, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of the press release issued this morning.  \n Now moving to our results for Q4, which also included the extra week. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.8% to $3.88 billion, which included $170 million from the 53rd week. On a 13-week comparable basis, this was the largest sales quarter in the history of the company. Also on a 13-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.8% on top of a 5.3% increase in the same period last year. \n Our strong comps were driven by a 2.8% increase in average ticket on flat transactions. Within our portfolio, we were very pleased with the performance of our key holiday categories, modestly offset by the performance of our outerwear business due to warm weather.  \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in fourth quarter was $1.34 billion or 34.57% of net sales, and expanded 213 basis points compared to last year. This year-over-year expansion was a sequential improvement from Q3 and in line with our expectations. Gross margin expansion for Q4 was driven by higher merchandise margin of 124 basis points as well as lower supply chain costs and leverage on occupancy costs. This increase in merchandise margin was primarily driven by the quality of our assortment and favorable sales mix. This was partially offset by higher shrink of approximately 50 basis points, in line with prior quarter.  \n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 12.6% to $915.8 million or 23.63% of net sales and deleveraged 102 basis points compared to last year. As we have highlighted on prior calls, the year-over-year deleverage in fourth quarter and throughout 2023 was driven by investments in our hourly wage rate, talent and technology to create better athlete experience as well as investments in marketing. Savings from our business optimization actions helped to offset these investments. Driven by our strong sales and higher gross margin, non-GAAP EBT in the fourth quarter was $427.7 million, 11.03% of net sales. This is up from non-GAAP EBT of $350.5 million or 9.74% of net sales in Q4 of 2022. \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter of $3.85, which included $0.19 from 53rd week. On a 13-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.66. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.93 in 2022, an increase of 24.9% on a 13- to 13-week basis.  \n During the quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $32.3 million related to our business optimization. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.57. For additional details, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of the press release issued this morning.  \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our year-end inventory levels increased 1% compared to last year. We believe our inventory is clean and well positioned. And in fact, our clearance penetration ended the year amongst the lowest it's ever been.  \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $151 million, and we paid $81 million in quarterly dividends.  \n Now moving to outlook. In 2024, we expect to grow both sales and profitability. Consolidated sales are expected to be in the range of $13 billion to $13.13 billion. We anticipate comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. EBT margin is planned to be at 10.9% at the midpoint. We anticipate gross margins to be approximately 35% and in line with 2023 non-GAAP results. Within this, we expect merchandise margin to expand modestly, offset by occupancy deleverage as we invest to reposition the portfolio. SG&A expenses are expected to leverage modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results, driven by our ongoing focus on improving productivity and reducing discretionary costs as well as the expected benefits from our business optimization actions. \n We anticipate full year earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.85 to $13.25. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%.  \n As we model 2024, I want to point out a few things that we expect to impact comparability of our financial results. First, keep in mind that the extra week in 2023 will create a shifted calendar. As a result, when we report our comp sales results, we will compare week 1 through 52 in 2024 with week 2 through 53 in 2023. We do not expect this shift to have a material impact on comp sales for the full year. However, we do expect our reported sales to be positively impacted by the shifted calendar in the first half with an offset in the second half.  \n During the first quarter, we will be investing in several exciting brand campaigns as well as support our Q1 House of Sport grand openings. Next, as a reminder, in Q1, we will see an unfavorable impact to our gross margin from higher shrink rates which we will anniversary starting in Q2. And finally, recall that our Q1 2023 tax rate was meaningfully lower than normal, driven by favorable impact of the vesting of employee equity awards and exercises. We do not anticipate this again in 2024.  \n I'll now discuss our capital allocation priorities. Investing in our business to drive profitable organic growth remains our top priority. And as Lauren said, in 2024, we will increase our capital investment to drive our business forward.  \n For 2024, our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditure of approximately $800 million. As we continue to reposition our portfolio, these investments will be concentrated in store growth, relocations and improvements in our existing stores, along with ongoing investments in technology and supply chain expansion. Our 2024 CapEx plan also includes purchase of certain real estate assets related to House of Sport, for which we are evaluating potential sale-leaseback opportunities.  \n House of Sport is one of the most exciting concepts in retail today. And in 2024, we expect to open eight new locations. As we elevate our store portfolio, seven of these are planned relocations or conversions of existing DICK'S stores, along with one new store at Prudential Center in Boston. We expect to begin construction on approximately 15 House of Sport locations that are scheduled to open throughout 2025. \n We will also open 16 next-generation 50,000 DICK'S stores in 2024. As part of this, we will relocate or remodel 12 existing DICK'S stores into this innovative new format and open 4 new locations. Across our footprint, we will add approximately 50 premium full-service footwear decks, taking this elevated athlete appearance to nearly 90% of our DICK'S locations.  \n In 2024, we are also excited to grow the footprint of our Golf Galaxy business and plan to open 10 Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. As part of this, we will relocate or remodel five existing Golf Galaxy stores into this immersive new format and open five new Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. \n Through these investments, we expect to increase our square footage by approximately 2% in 2024, marking our most significant expansion since 2017. Lastly, we plan to begin construction on a new regional distribution center opening in 2026. This new DC will play an important role in supporting the long-term growth of our business.  \n Before continuing, I want to share why we are so excited about these investments, especially the House of Sport and our next-generation 50k DICK'S locations. As you will see on the slide, for a new House of Sport, in year 1, we expect approximately $35 million in omnichannel sales and a very strong profitability with a target of approximately 20% EBITDA margins. In terms of capital, it will take about $11.5 million of net CapEx to open a House of Sport location, resulting in an expected year 1 cash-on-cash return of approximately 35%. \n We also expect attractive returns from our next-generation 50,000 DICK'S store investments, where we are targeting approximately $14 million in year 1 omnichannel sales and a comparable EBITDA margin of approximately 20%.  \n We also remain committed to returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. During 2023, we returned $1 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in the profitable long-term growth of our business. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to a healthy balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.  \n Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends of 10% on an annualized payout of $4.40 per share or $1.10 on a quarterly basis. This is on top of a 105% increase last year and marks the 10th consecutive year that our shareholders have benefited from a dividend increase. In addition, our 2024 plan includes our expectation for share repurchases of $300 million, which is included in our EPS guidance. As always, we will optically look at additional share repurchases throughout the year.  \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Lauren to review some of the key initiatives that will drive our profitable growth in 2024 and over the long term. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Navdeep. As we turn to 2024, our focus is on driving sustained profitable growth by innovating within the omnichannel athlete experience, curating a compelling and differentiated product assortment, providing a best-in-class teammate experience and driving deep engagement with the DICK'S brand. \n Industry leaders consistently innovate from a foundation of strength, positioning themselves ahead of the curve. With this mindset, a key part of our growth strategy for this year and future years is continuing to drive omnichannel athlete engagement by repositioning our portfolio and experiences through house of Sport and our next-generation 50,000 DICK'S store. \n With House of Sport, we are truly redefining sports retail. Since we launched our first location in 2021, this highly experiential destination has brought very strong engagement with our athletes, brand partners and communities and has delivered powerful financial results. Compared to a typical DICK'S store, athletes are traveling farther to visit House of Sport, increasing the time they spend in the store and visiting more frequently. Because of the engagement and experience at House of Sport, our national brand partners are providing access to unique and expanded assortments, while new and emerging brands see it as a platform for growth. \n With a total of 12 House of Sport locations now open, we look forward to opening another 8 locations in 2024. Next month, we are so excited to open a House of Sport in our home town of Pittsburgh and at the Prudential Center in Downtown Boston. We will support these grand openings with high-impact marketing. \n With the compelling economics Navdeep outlined, House of Sport is a significant part of our future growth story. As we said, by 2027, we expect to have between 75 to 100 House of Sport locations across the country. The vast majority of these will be relocations or conversions of existing DICK'S stores into House of Sport. \n At the same time, we're continuing to innovate with our next-generation 50,000, which completely revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot DICK'S store. Inspired by House of Sport, this store has a similar elevated assortment and service model, premium experiences and enhanced visual expressions, and the format is delivering great results. \n We opened 11 next-generation 50,000 locations in 2023 and are excited to open another 16 locations in 2024. This one-two punch of House of Sport and our next-generation 50,000 is the future of our DICK'S stores and will serve as the hub for our athletes' omnichannel experience. \n Golf Galaxy is another important part of our growth story. This past year, we grew our Golf Galaxy footprint to over 100 locations. As Navdeep said, we plan to further grow our footprint through Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, which offer an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels. With 14 performance centers now open, we're excited to open another 10 locations throughout 2024. \n This spring, we're investing in marketing to drive market share and elevate the Golf Galaxy brand perception in a memorable and relatable way for golfers. During 2023, golf rounds played in the U.S. hit an all-time high, and we believe golf is a compelling long-term growth opportunity. \n When we talk about drivers of success, it's critical to mention our strong brand relationships. With these strategic partnerships, we've built our industry-leading assortment, making DICK'S the go-to destination for differentiated and on-trend product. \n We'll continue to make big bets with our partners while also actively seeking to work with new and emerging brands. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our highly profitable portfolio of powerhouse vertical brands, including VRST, DSG and CALIA, that are gaining meaningful traction with our athletes. \n For DSG, which is our largest vertical brand, we expect to build on the success of our Q4 campaign with an always-on approach focused on family, value and sport. With CALIA, our second-largest women's apparel brand behind only Nike, we recently launched the Inspire collection. This is our most versatile collection yet and features an innovative new fabric. We're supporting this important launch through a campaign that uniquely positions CALIA as a performance brand that embodies strength as beautiful. \n Our digital capabilities are also core to our omnichannel success, and we continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes to spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. As part of this, we continue to rapidly advance our capabilities in getting products into the hands of our athletes very quickly. And throughout 2024, we'll look to drive consideration for dicks.com through a marketing campaign where we're teaming up with A-list celebrities and adding some humor to really make it memorable. \n As we expand our leadership position in youth sports, GameChanger, another incredibly strong digital capability we have, plays a pivotal role. GameChanger has become a leader in the multibillion-dollar youth sports technology market. It is a go-to destination for millions of parents, grandparents and fans to watch games, track stats and share video highlights for athletes of all ages. \n Last year, over 1 million teams used GameChanger to capture moments from 7 million games and create 110 million highlight clips. In fact, more games are covered on GameChanger in a single spring month than have been played in the entire history of Major League Baseball. \n As a recurring revenue, Software as a Service platform, Game changer is very profitable and has grown sales at over a 35% CAGR since 2017. We expect GameChanger to reach approximately $100 million in sales this year. \n Importantly, GameChanger families are some of DICK'S Sporting Goods most valuable customers. A GameChanger customer who also has a DICK'S scorecard spends over 2x more per year at DICK'S than a typical scorecard member. With customers visiting the app over 13 times a month, we believe there are numerous opportunities for DICK'S to reach these customers in unique and authentic ways to drive brand loyalty and sales. \n Lastly, we will continue to invest in DICK'S brand-building through our Sports Change Lives campaign. At DICK'S, we believe sports have the power to change lives, and our objective with this work is to unequivocally communicate who we are and what we stand for. We're pleased with the first year results and the way the campaign is resonating with our athletes and increasing brand connection. In the second year of this campaign, you'll see new creative expressions during high-profile sports moments like the NCAA tournament, the Summer Olympics and NFL games. \n In conclusion, we are extremely optimistic about our future and the opportunities ahead of us. We're very pleased with our results and accomplishments in 2023, especially our progress in advancing House of Sport, our next-generation 50,000 and upgrades to our existing footprint to enhance the athlete experience. We're continuing to innovate our omnichannel approach, which is further improving convenience and satisfaction and driving higher sales and market share gains. \n Our decision to step up our investments in 2024 to fuel our future growth clearly demonstrates the confidence we have in our business and our team. I'm incredibly proud to be working alongside such a talented and motivated group across every part of our company, from stores, to our corporate teams, to our distribution centers, to our GameChanger team, and I'm so excited about the future. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on margins and growth going forward. The business looks like it's rebased, and you now have the House of Sport coming in, which sound very positive to both growth and to margin. Curious how we should think about the business from this point going forward. Are you thinking about it in terms of earnings growth? Or should we think about the margin growing and making this a margin story as well? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. We are incredibly excited about the momentum that we have in our business, just coming off of this Q4 with a 2.8% comp on top of a 5.3% comp. And then looking forward to the year, we are driving growth in top line, margin and profitability overall. \n And I think the key driver of the margin story is really the differentiated product that we continue to have access to and expand access to. That product is resonating with athletes, it's creating newness and innovation and just a feel in the store of energy. And it's also enabling us to navigate, this past Q4, a fairly promotional environment, where we were able to navigate without having to be extremely promotional. And actually, we drove over 200 basis points of gross margin. \n So House of Sport is a great lever in that it enables us to provide a completely immersive experience for athletes. We've got rock-climbing walls and tracks and field and a whole bunch of elevated service and visual presentation. But importantly, from a margin standpoint, House of Sport does encourage our brand partners, both our strategic partners and our new and emerging brand partners, to experiment. We can bring a brand to life in our Co Lab space in a really exciting way, and it's therefore enabling us to drive even deeper partnerships and more access to new and different products. So overall, very confident about the long-term margin story. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And I'll paraphrase, but I don't want it to be my follow-up. But the paraphrase, it sounds like in the future, a combination of margins and earnings growth. It's not just about dollar growth, but margins can expand as well. \n And then my follow-up is, thinking about the industry and market share for 2024 among the categories that you sell, it's just hard because we don't see a clean benchmark for what the industry can grow. But do you assume the industry grows? And are we reaching some type of normal industry growth CAGR and market share growth CAGR? And how do you -- how should we think about that for the next several years? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. So our strategy is to continue to gain market share in this industry, and we're doing that in several ways. We're doing it with the strategic pillars that we've talked about, be it the differentiated products; our investment in athlete experience; our investment in our brand and our teammate experience, which is really an incredible asset that we have because we have the best teammates in the business, and they have incredible momentum. \n So when we look at the growth, we're -- it's coming from market share gains. We're also reimagining our portfolio such that we're going to have 20 House of Sports and 27 new prototypes of our 50,000 new experience, which is really a takedown of House of Sport and a super exciting place. \n So to answer your question directly, we're not counting on a significant amount of category growth because we think we have so much momentum to drive share. \nNavdeep Gupta: I mean, I'll just build on what Lauren said. If you look at it, right, it's $140 billion overall industry, which is highly fragmented. And what we reiterated today is our core strategies are working really well, and we actually gained almost 50 basis points of our market share over 2023. So really exciting about the results we are posting as well as the core strategy and how those core strategies are resonating with our athletes. \nLauren Hobart: I'm going to add one last thing to Navdeep's comments, which is the consumer has held up incredibly well. We saw that in Q4, we saw it all last year, where we didn't see a trade-down from best to better, better to good. We saw growth across all income demographics. So we do have a healthy consumer, and they are increasingly choosing DICK'S to meet their needs. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congrats on the quarter and the year, really great, phenomenal execution. So Lauren, I'm going to stick with the House of Sports, the notion that the kind of 4-wall EBITDA is higher than the core. What exactly -- and I know you touched on this earlier. But can you describe sort of the revenue model? How much is from goods, I guess, primarily versus services? The goods that are in there, I assume they sound like they're better and best. And then how much of the House of Sports is sort of exclusive and differentiated versus core DICK'S? \n And then for Navdeep, my follow-up is, I mean, inventory is so clean, right, across kind of like the landscape. So two things here. Can you first discuss the level of innovation and trends that you're seeing in 2024? And then secondarily, can you talk about sort of the need and the potential for replenishment, given that inventory levels are pretty low? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne, yes. So when you look at a House of Sport store, it's important to note that all of our core strategies are coming to life in just even a dialed up way. So our differentiated product, the access we have there, the service model, the experience, is all coming to life in a really fantastic way. \n The vast majority of our revenue still comes from product. Obviously, we also have service revenue in there, but it's a typical business model. And I think what's really driving that is how the athlete is responding. We've got athletes who are driving further, they're coming more frequently, they're spending more time when they get to a House of Sport. And overall, the sales per square foot as a result of that is higher. So it's -- really, it's our core business model, just really elevated. \n I'll start with the answer to the question you asked Navdeep, just about the newness and the innovation for 2024. We are really excited. And I would say, if you go into our stores right now, you can see our spring set. You can see that on the softline side as well as the hardlines and team sports, we are very excited about the innovation that's coming down the pike and our increased access to some of the very hot product that people are reacting -- the athletes are reacting really well to. \n Navdeep, I'll turn it to you for the inventory question. \nNavdeep Gupta: Adrienne, thanks for the question. So really pleased with the overall inventory and the quality of the inventory that we finished 2023 with. Our inventory grew just about 1% on top of a 5% growth in sales. And as we reiterated this morning, that the focus that we have of keeping our inventory clean and well positioned is a core tenet and a core strategy of the company, and that is what is allowing us to continue to differentiate our results versus our competition. \n And in terms of our expectations for 2024, like Lauren said, there is so much of innovative and newness available to us in the market, not only from the national brands, but also from the emerging brands. So looking deeper into it and really excited about the spring assortment as well as the more assortment that we see coming into our stores, both in House of Sport and in the next-gen 50,000 locations. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is trying to pull together some of the different commentary and questions that we've already had. As you think about -- you gave the EBITDA -- 4-wall EBITDA margin for both concepts. Can you talk about the merch margin? It sounds like it's higher. How does that -- how do you think about the other lines in the P&L? Is the occupancy cost higher? And then what about the cost to actually operate the store? In terms of trying to understand the breakdown to get to that 20% 4-wall EBITDA margin. And how does that compare to the existing box? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Chris, first of all, really excited to be able to share the economics of our House of Sport location and the 50,000, our next-gen store. This has been something that has been requested for a while, but we wanted to make sure we had enough maturity as well as enough time behind us to be able to share these economics. \n So let's start with the top line. Really great to see, first of all, our stores open at full maturity because of the strong brand awareness and the brand positioning that we have in these markets. The House of Sport locations are opening on an omnichannel basis, almost about a $35 million in top line sales and almost about $14 million when it comes to the next-gen 50,000. \n And like I think that you called it out, that we have a comparable EBITDA margins between both these boxes. And as you can expect, there's a little bit of an interplay that happens between the margin and the SG&A. You have a little bit more of the elevated experience being provided in House of Sport locations, and so therefore, there is a little bit of a higher service level component of it. But the service also comes with the revenue associated with this, so there's a little bit of a higher margin you get from that. \n I would say -- and I think that you called out occupancy. There's a little bit of a more capital investment that we are putting into it, so that plays into the depreciation. But when you look at the overall, just the operating -- or the EBITDA margin rates that we are driving, we are very, very happy with the returns that we are driving and the strong profitability that we are delivering out of both these boxes. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. So succinctly, it allows you -- and I think, Lauren, you said this earlier. It's basically this is the next sort of lever to continue to gain share. And the components might be different, but at the end of the day, the margin returns are comparable and it's the opportunity to continue to grow. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Chris, I will build on what we have been saying, that the financial returns are great, but what is even better is how well this overall concept is resonating not only with our brand partners, with our athletes and also with the community. And that's what we see as a long-term driver of the differentiation of getting better access, getting more allocated product available to us, having the emerging brands come to us and want to partner with us in these really, really experiential destinations. And that is what we consider as a true differentiator DICK'S Sporting Goods. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. That's very helpful. And my follow-up is, Navdeep, you talked about some particular headwinds in the first quarter. Maybe is there -- maybe could you just bring those all together? And is there a certain way that we should be thinking about the investments and how that's going to affect the SG&A? And you talked about shrink in terms of the gross margin. Would you still expect merchandise margin to be up? So maybe just a finer point around the first quarter. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. So a few comments that we gave out in our prepared comments today. First of all, I'll start with the sales, right? We're going to have a shifted calendar, so there will be a little bit of an impact to our total top line sales total revenue, but not a significant impact when you think around a shifted basis on comp. \n What we did call out was just a reminder, we saw the elevated levels of shrink in Q2 of 2023. So in Q1, we haven't lapped that as yet. So as you all are modeling, it will be helpful to keep that in mind. The other is the tax rate. If you remember, our tax rate in Q1 was significantly low compared to our normalized tax rate, and you will see that piece play out as well. \n And finally, hopefully, you all have watched some of the exciting brand campaigns that we have going on right now between brand campaigns associated with our launch of our CALIA Inspire collection, our dicks.com campaign. And so we are investing into that. In addition, we're going to be opening two really exciting House of Sport locations here in Q1 between Ross Park Mall here in Pittsburgh and at Prudential Center. So you will see some of the investments associated with those two stores in Q1 as well. So a slightly elevated levels of preopening expense, maybe I'll just put a finer point on that one. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wanted to ask about just if there was any more detail on the performance of footwear versus apparel versus hardlines in the fourth quarter. \n And our second question was, if there was any impact to the 2024 comp guide as a result of the relocations that you're doing for House of Sport. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Kate. So in terms of category performance, with the 2.8% comp this past quarter, we saw growth across all of our key categories. So growth in footwear, growth in apparel and growth in some of the key hardlines categories. So it really was across the board. The only area of softness was the cold weather didn't come as we had hoped it would, and so there was some softness in outerwear. But across the board, really strong growth in our core categories. \n I'll turn it to Navdeep for the next question. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Kate, in terms of the comp guidance, overall, like we said, because of the shifted calendar, no material impact to the comp cadence itself when you look at it. However, keep in mind, last year, we were converting eight combo locations into House of Sport which were closed during the first half of last year. So we expect our comp in the first half to be slightly stronger than the comps in the back half of the year. \nKatharine McShane: But there won't be any impact from store closures as you relocate this year? \nNavdeep Gupta: No. We're not doing the closed remodels as we did last year. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Great quarter, and thanks for all the commentary on the store economics. Really appreciate that. A couple of follow-ups on just the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of sort of digital transactions versus in-store transactions in the fourth quarter? Were in-store transactions positive? \nLauren Hobart: Robby, thanks for the question. We're not guiding to digital versus in-store overall. In the fourth quarter, transactions were flat and most of the growth came from ticket. However, it's really important to note that, in Q4 of last year, we were up over 7.6% in transactions. So from a 2-year basis on an omnichannel standpoint, really, really strong growth in transactions. Digital business remains really strong, but we're not going to get into more detail than that. \nRobert Ohmes: And then just for the comp guidance you're giving for 2024. Should we -- how should we think about the ticket versus transaction component? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Robby, we won't break that down any further. I'm really excited about -- to be able to guide on a positive basis on top of a 2.4% comp from last year. And our focus is continuing to be about driving sales and profitability growth for the business. \nLauren Hobart: Overall, this year, we did have -- the majority of growth did come from transaction growth, if you look at the 2.4%. So we are very confident in our comp guidance. \nRobert Ohmes: And then just one quick clarification. On the -- for the store economic models, when you guys say omnichannel sales, is it -- is that -- is it a web sale that's fulfilled by the store to call it -- what gets included in omnichannel sales at a House of Sport or the new 50,000 store? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. No, Robby, that's exactly that. It's not only the stores that are fulfilled from a store with an athlete walking in. Even an omnichannel sale or a digital sale that gets fulfilled by the store is also included in that because that's what we look as the 4-wall performance of the store, including the work that our team members are doing in fulfilling an omnichannel order. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. And the stores are fulfilling over 80% of e-com orders, 90% of orders across the board, if you include the brick-and-mortar. So it's appropriate to think of it as omnichannel sales. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Congrats on another nice quarter. \nLauren Hobart: Thank you. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you. \nBrian Nagel: First question I have, just to go back -- it wasn't that long ago we were talking a lot about shrink. Looking at the results today in your commentary, it seems as though you've done a nice job kind of getting your arms around the shrink. The question I have is, as we're looking now into 2024, how should we be thinking about the trajectory in shrink or the mitigation efforts that are ongoing at DICK'S to manage shrink? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Brian. Yes, we do feel that we are appropriately reserved for shrink. We've been doing significantly more inventory pulses and I do believe that we have an appropriate reserve going forward. In Q1, it's important to note that we are still up against the headwind of the fact that we didn't put the extra shrink reserve in until the end of Q2 last year. \n But overall, we're doing a lot of things in store to mitigate. We're working with loss prevention and local law enforcement as well as moving products to the back of the store that are high shrink. So we have a lot going on. But overall, we are appropriately reserved. \nBrian Nagel: Got it. And then my follow-up question, this is a bit of, I think, a follow-up to the prior question. But just with regard to transaction growth. So DICK'S has done a phenomenal job here driving transaction growth, and you clearly stand out amongst most retailers doing so. \n You're recognizing all the changes that have happened in the business and the merchandising and all. But is there anything you can kind of help us understand better, underlying drivers of that transaction growth? Are you seeing any type of variability across the chain, maybe within departments, so we get a better understanding of kind of the sustainability of that? \nLauren Hobart: Brian, I really think the transaction growth has so much to do with things like our differentiated product and the access that we have. But on top of that, when athletes are coming into our stores, our team -- or shopping online, our team is striving to make that omnichannel athlete experience, really satisfy, and they're making great progress there. And then also, I think the brand and the fact that we are a brand that is very much based in our values, and we continue to talk about the power of sports. So all of those things are working together and driving strong transactions. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Brian, I'll add to the fact that, if you look at it in 2023 and in fourth quarter, we gained 7 million new athletes in 2023. And just in fourth quarter alone, we gained 2 million new athletes. So back to Lauren's point, the athlete database that we have, the work that we have been doing around personalization and the loyalty and our scorecard program, in addition to having the right product, our ability to be able to go and address and discuss those type of features and product availability in our store is resonating very well as well with our athletes. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Congrats on another great year. I think you said the House of sports, they open at maturity. How do we think about the comp contribution for both House of Sport and the next-gen 50,000 square foot stores if they're opening at maturity? How do we think about them, the comp contribution in year 2 and beyond, going forward? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. John, I think that's a 2-part question there, so I'll start with the second part in terms of the comp contribution as we look at the growth in the second year. And that has been one of the questions. We are very optimistic and confident in the results that we are seeing. \n So first of all, we don't have a large sample. There are two stores of our stores that were opened in 2021 and 2022. They actually have comped the second full year. And what we saw was, in 2023, they actually posted comp sales growth again in year 2. So really happy with the overall performance. \n In terms of the comp contribution and so the opportunities when we are relocating, let's say, a 50,000 or an 80,000 box that goes from somewhere to $19 million to $20 million going to closer to a $35 million omnichannel sales, that's the comp contribution that we are really excited about as well. \n And then -- and I would be remiss if I didn't add the differentiated product that we are able to get through these things, through the next-gen 50,000 or House or Sport location, that allows us to cascade that innovation and newness down into our -- into the normal DICK'S stores as well, is allowing us to continue to elevate the overall portfolio of the stores and the performance that we are seeing out of those. \nJohn Kernan: That's helpful. I guess my follow-up, just shift to more of a category level. Softlines, apparel, footwear, I think it's going to be around 60% of the business this year. It's not terribly different from where it was historically, but I think we can all see that the allocations from vendors have gotten significantly better. The private label offering has clearly increased as well. I think this has contributed to 255 basis points in merch margin expansion since pre-COVID levels. How should we think about future merch margin? Particularly as all of the softline categories seem to be elevated at this point. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. So John, I would say that the overall -- the composition of the product continues to be the biggest driver of our merch margin expansion when you look at it versus 2019. And we are confident that, that will continue to be one of the biggest drivers. \n The two other drivers that we talk about internally a lot is our excitement about the vertical brand work. And hopefully, you've seen some of the work that we have recently launched in terms of the CALIA Inspire product that we launched here in 2024. The DSG brand is resonating really well with our athletes. We actually have now an always-on kind of a message around DSG brand. So the softline vertical brand product is resonating really well with our athletes. \n So the vertical brand and continuing to lean into that with moving towards the $2 billion long-term goal that we have will be another big driver of the margin in the recent years as well as we look forward on a go-forward basis. And finally, we are constantly elevating our -- some of the promotional optimization and pricing optimization capabilities as well. So we'll continue to lean into the same things that we have leaned on, and really confident about the differentiated product. \nLauren Hobart: John, it's also -- it's across the board. It's not -- there isn't just a softlines story here. We are focused on margin gains across the entire portfolio. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: Great quarter. I was wondering if you could share a little more thought on the share gain that you're seeing and where that may be coming from. Like is it -- I'm just curious, I mean, you guys continue to execute so well. And maybe you could share some thoughts there. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Joe. I mean, we are gaining market share due to our differentiated experience, the reimagining of our portfolio, the experience we're providing. I think it's coming from a lot of places. And as we continue to get differentiated access to product, I believe it will continue to come. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. And then just a quick sort of unrelated follow-up. But with regard to freight, and I have -- it's been a tailwind for you guys. When does -- do we lap some of that? And also, have you seen any pressure on future costs related to what's going on in kind of the global supply chain network with the Red Sea, the Panama Canal issues, all those kinds of things? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Joe, like you called out in 2023, we saw the tailwind from the freight. As we look to 2024, we are not expecting any kind of tailwind or headwind right now. But to your point, we are definitely evaluating the evolving situation that we have across the world right now. But overall, we feel great about the inventory position, and we'll continue to monitor how the overall situations evolve. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: I was wondering how the shift to the newer concepts and also the rollout of the [ floor ] decks will impact the assortment on a couple of dimensions. So first, if you think about sort of the big global brands versus smaller brands or your own private label, how will that mix skew as you build out some of the newer concepts? It sounds like, from an answer to an earlier question, that vertical brand penetration is going to go up from here. Curious on the global brand aspect. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, we are excited, I would say, across the board, right? Our partnership with the national brands is an all-time high. We continue to differentiate not only our service levels, but the experience that we provide within our stores. \n And the national brands, all of them want to be rooted in sports. So when they look to a partner that can not only bring their full assortment and breadth of product to life, but actually can bring that across -- bring that to life across the nation, we are the destination for that. So we continue to see a very strong level of partnership and interest and the innovation and newness that is coming into our stores. \n Likewise, we are very excited about some of the emerging brands like On and HOKA and Free People Movement. And we see the opportunity not only to continue to have a deeper partnership with these brands, but also expand that relationship deeper into our own chain. \n And finally, the work that our vertical brand team has done is phenomenal, really excited about the launches that we have done this year and what more is to come in 2024. \nWarren Cheng: I also wanted to ask about your latest view on where you see long-term normalized gross margins and EBIT margins as you shift to these newer concepts. There's a lot of moving parts here. And curious if you can give us your view on the level and also the ongoing drivers that will shape margins past this year. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, today, we are not going to be providing a long-term algorithm. But what we have consistently said is and what we are consistently delivering is the fact that we are confident in driving the long-term sales and profitability of the company leaning into the core strategies that Lauren has laid it out today. So we'll continue to execute and confident in the guidance that we have provided to be able to drive positive comps in 2024 on top of a strong 2.4% comp that we posted in '23. \nOperator: Today's final question will come from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the outdoor concepts. You talked about bigger-picture restructuring or changing some things there. But more specifics, what is the plan in terms of store count there? Are you closing those stores down? And just longer term, a couple of iterations you've had on the outdoor business in your history. What's sort of the long-term thought process there? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Mike, we continue to be really excited about the outdoor category. When you look at it at the macro level, this is a $40 billion highly fragmented TAM that is out there. And we know there is an opportunity to similarly differentiate in terms of service, product experience as well as the overall assortment that we can provide. \n So what we have done in 2023, we've acquired Moosejaw and the work that we did last year was actually bringing the back office operation of Moosejaw and Public Lands together to be able to drive the long-term profitability in that business. And what we have called out in the business optimization actions are actually rationalizing some of the investments that we have made. \n We are not -- we are closing Moosejaw locations, but we are confident in the go-forward business, and we'll continue to evaluate that space. But overall, on a long-term basis, continue to remain really confident about the opportunity in the outdoor segment. \nMichael Baker: Okay. One quick follow-up. I may have missed it. Just looking for a number. Did you tell us how much it costs, the cost to build the 50,000 stores? So I think you gave us the sales volume and the EBITDA margin. I may have missed it, I didn't hear the cost to build and therefore the cash-on-cash returns. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Actually, Mike, on both these metrics are in the slide that will be there on our Investor Relations webpage, both the net capital investment, inventory, as well as the preopening and then the cash-on-cash return. \nMichael Baker: Got it. Sorry, doing the call on the phone, so I missed that. Appreciate the color. \nNavdeep Gupta: We appreciate the flexibility on joining us early here. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Lauren Hobart, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, everybody, and thanks for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And I want to give a shout out to our 50,000 teammates who really are the reason that we are driving these incredible results. \n Thank you all very much. See you next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope you enjoyed the video. DICK'S is a really special company with 75 years of history reinventing sport. It's been a terrific year, and I'm really proud of the team for their extraordinary efforts.\n Since our founding in 1948, DICK'S had believed in the power of sports to change lives. We bring this to life every day through the experience we provide for our athletes; the differentiated products we offer; the marketing we create to connect our athletes deeply with our brand; and most importantly, our teammates. Through these strategic pillars, we are actively creating and defining our future. And during this past year, it's evident just how far we've extended our leadership position.  \n For the full year, we delivered record sales of $13 billion. On a 52-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.4%, driven by growth in transactions as we continue to gain market share. We added nearly 7 million new athletes during the year and reached record highs in our active athlete database. It's clear that sport and leading healthy, active lifestyles are priorities for our athletes, and they are increasingly looking to DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet these needs.  \n With our industry-leading assortment and strong execution, we capped off the year with incredibly strong fourth quarter and holiday season. Including week 53, our quarterly sales grew 7.8% to $3.9 billion. On a 13-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.8%, which was on top of a 5.3% comp increase last year. \n On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin expanded more than 200 basis points, driven by higher merchandise margin. Our non-GAAP EBT margin was 11%. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $3.85, which included $0.19 for the extra week. On a 13-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.  \n For 2024, we're guiding to another strong year and expect to grow both our sales and earnings through positive comps, higher merchandise margin and productivity gains. Our inventory is well positioned, and we're excited about the assortment we have curated for our athletes. We expect our comp sales to be in the range of 1% to 2% and expect our EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $13.25.  \n We're excited to continue redefining the future of retail. With the continued success of our growth initiatives, we will increase our capital investment to drive our business forward, both digitally and in store, and continue gaining market share in this fragmented $140 billion industry. \n A key driver of this growth is the repositioning of our portfolio, including House of Sport, our next-generation 50,000, which completely revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot DICK'S store; and Golf Galaxy Performance Center. Navdeep will share greater detail on House of Sport's compelling unit economics.  \n I'd like to thank all our teammates for delivering another strong year and for their passion, hard work and dedication to our business. At DICK'S, it's our people who make us great, and none of what we accomplished is possible without our exceptional team.  \n Before I go deeper into our growth strategies, I'll first turn the call over to Navdeep to share more detail on our financial results, 2024 outlook and capital allocation. Thanks, Navdeep. As we turn to 2024, our focus is on driving sustained profitable growth by innovating within the omnichannel athlete experience, curating a compelling and differentiated product assortment, providing a best-in-class teammate experience and driving deep engagement with the DICK'S brand. \n Industry leaders consistently innovate from a foundation of strength, positioning themselves ahead of the curve. With this mindset, a key part of our growth strategy for this year and future years is continuing to drive omnichannel athlete engagement by repositioning our portfolio and experiences through house of Sport and our next-generation 50,000 DICK'S store. \n With House of Sport, we are truly redefining sports retail. Since we launched our first location in 2021, this highly experiential destination has brought very strong engagement with our athletes, brand partners and communities and has delivered powerful financial results. Compared to a typical DICK'S store, athletes are traveling farther to visit House of Sport, increasing the time they spend in the store and visiting more frequently. Because of the engagement and experience at House of Sport, our national brand partners are providing access to unique and expanded assortments, while new and emerging brands see it as a platform for growth. \n With a total of 12 House of Sport locations now open, we look forward to opening another 8 locations in 2024. Next month, we are so excited to open a House of Sport in our home town of Pittsburgh and at the Prudential Center in Downtown Boston. We will support these grand openings with high-impact marketing. \n With the compelling economics Navdeep outlined, House of Sport is a significant part of our future growth story. As we said, by 2027, we expect to have between 75 to 100 House of Sport locations across the country. The vast majority of these will be relocations or conversions of existing DICK'S stores into House of Sport. \n At the same time, we're continuing to innovate with our next-generation 50,000, which completely revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot DICK'S store. Inspired by House of Sport, this store has a similar elevated assortment and service model, premium experiences and enhanced visual expressions, and the format is delivering great results. \n We opened 11 next-generation 50,000 locations in 2023 and are excited to open another 16 locations in 2024. This one-two punch of House of Sport and our next-generation 50,000 is the future of our DICK'S stores and will serve as the hub for our athletes' omnichannel experience. \n Golf Galaxy is another important part of our growth story. This past year, we grew our Golf Galaxy footprint to over 100 locations. As Navdeep said, we plan to further grow our footprint through Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, which offer an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels. With 14 performance centers now open, we're excited to open another 10 locations throughout 2024. \n This spring, we're investing in marketing to drive market share and elevate the Golf Galaxy brand perception in a memorable and relatable way for golfers. During 2023, golf rounds played in the U.S. hit an all-time high, and we believe golf is a compelling long-term growth opportunity. \n When we talk about drivers of success, it's critical to mention our strong brand relationships. With these strategic partnerships, we've built our industry-leading assortment, making DICK'S the go-to destination for differentiated and on-trend product. \n We'll continue to make big bets with our partners while also actively seeking to work with new and emerging brands. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our highly profitable portfolio of powerhouse vertical brands, including VRST, DSG and CALIA, that are gaining meaningful traction with our athletes. \n For DSG, which is our largest vertical brand, we expect to build on the success of our Q4 campaign with an always-on approach focused on family, value and sport. With CALIA, our second-largest women's apparel brand behind only Nike, we recently launched the Inspire collection. This is our most versatile collection yet and features an innovative new fabric. We're supporting this important launch through a campaign that uniquely positions CALIA as a performance brand that embodies strength as beautiful. \n Our digital capabilities are also core to our omnichannel success, and we continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes to spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. As part of this, we continue to rapidly advance our capabilities in getting products into the hands of our athletes very quickly. And throughout 2024, we'll look to drive consideration for dicks.com through a marketing campaign where we're teaming up with A-list celebrities and adding some humor to really make it memorable. \n As we expand our leadership position in youth sports, GameChanger, another incredibly strong digital capability we have, plays a pivotal role. GameChanger has become a leader in the multibillion-dollar youth sports technology market. It is a go-to destination for millions of parents, grandparents and fans to watch games, track stats and share video highlights for athletes of all ages. \n Last year, over 1 million teams used GameChanger to capture moments from 7 million games and create 110 million highlight clips. In fact, more games are covered on GameChanger in a single spring month than have been played in the entire history of Major League Baseball. \n As a recurring revenue, Software as a Service platform, Game changer is very profitable and has grown sales at over a 35% CAGR since 2017. We expect GameChanger to reach approximately $100 million in sales this year. \n Importantly, GameChanger families are some of DICK'S Sporting Goods most valuable customers. A GameChanger customer who also has a DICK'S scorecard spends over 2x more per year at DICK'S than a typical scorecard member. With customers visiting the app over 13 times a month, we believe there are numerous opportunities for DICK'S to reach these customers in unique and authentic ways to drive brand loyalty and sales. \n Lastly, we will continue to invest in DICK'S brand-building through our Sports Change Lives campaign. At DICK'S, we believe sports have the power to change lives, and our objective with this work is to unequivocally communicate who we are and what we stand for. We're pleased with the first year results and the way the campaign is resonating with our athletes and increasing brand connection. In the second year of this campaign, you'll see new creative expressions during high-profile sports moments like the NCAA tournament, the Summer Olympics and NFL games. \n In conclusion, we are extremely optimistic about our future and the opportunities ahead of us. We're very pleased with our results and accomplishments in 2023, especially our progress in advancing House of Sport, our next-generation 50,000 and upgrades to our existing footprint to enhance the athlete experience. We're continuing to innovate our omnichannel approach, which is further improving convenience and satisfaction and driving higher sales and market share gains. \n Our decision to step up our investments in 2024 to fuel our future growth clearly demonstrates the confidence we have in our business and our team. I'm incredibly proud to be working alongside such a talented and motivated group across every part of our company, from stores, to our corporate teams, to our distribution centers, to our GameChanger team, and I'm so excited about the future. \n This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Thanks, Simeon. We are incredibly excited about the momentum that we have in our business, just coming off of this Q4 with a 2.8% comp on top of a 5.3% comp. And then looking forward to the year, we are driving growth in top line, margin and profitability overall. \n And I think the key driver of the margin story is really the differentiated product that we continue to have access to and expand access to. That product is resonating with athletes, it's creating newness and innovation and just a feel in the store of energy. And it's also enabling us to navigate, this past Q4, a fairly promotional environment, where we were able to navigate without having to be extremely promotional. And actually, we drove over 200 basis points of gross margin. \n So House of Sport is a great lever in that it enables us to provide a completely immersive experience for athletes. We've got rock-climbing walls and tracks and field and a whole bunch of elevated service and visual presentation. But importantly, from a margin standpoint, House of Sport does encourage our brand partners, both our strategic partners and our new and emerging brand partners, to experiment. We can bring a brand to life in our Co Lab space in a really exciting way, and it's therefore enabling us to drive even deeper partnerships and more access to new and different products. So overall, very confident about the long-term margin story. Yes. So our strategy is to continue to gain market share in this industry, and we're doing that in several ways. We're doing it with the strategic pillars that we've talked about, be it the differentiated products; our investment in athlete experience; our investment in our brand and our teammate experience, which is really an incredible asset that we have because we have the best teammates in the business, and they have incredible momentum. \n So when we look at the growth, we're -- it's coming from market share gains. We're also reimagining our portfolio such that we're going to have 20 House of Sports and 27 new prototypes of our 50,000 new experience, which is really a takedown of House of Sport and a super exciting place. \n So to answer your question directly, we're not counting on a significant amount of category growth because we think we have so much momentum to drive share. I'm going to add one last thing to Navdeep's comments, which is the consumer has held up incredibly well. We saw that in Q4, we saw it all last year, where we didn't see a trade-down from best to better, better to good. We saw growth across all income demographics. So we do have a healthy consumer, and they are increasingly choosing DICK'S to meet their needs. Thanks, Adrienne, yes. So when you look at a House of Sport store, it's important to note that all of our core strategies are coming to life in just even a dialed up way. So our differentiated product, the access we have there, the service model, the experience, is all coming to life in a really fantastic way. \n The vast majority of our revenue still comes from product. Obviously, we also have service revenue in there, but it's a typical business model. And I think what's really driving that is how the athlete is responding. We've got athletes who are driving further, they're coming more frequently, they're spending more time when they get to a House of Sport. And overall, the sales per square foot as a result of that is higher. So it's -- really, it's our core business model, just really elevated. \n I'll start with the answer to the question you asked Navdeep, just about the newness and the innovation for 2024. We are really excited. And I would say, if you go into our stores right now, you can see our spring set. You can see that on the softline side as well as the hardlines and team sports, we are very excited about the innovation that's coming down the pike and our increased access to some of the very hot product that people are reacting -- the athletes are reacting really well to. \n Navdeep, I'll turn it to you for the inventory question. Thanks, Kate. So in terms of category performance, with the 2.8% comp this past quarter, we saw growth across all of our key categories. So growth in footwear, growth in apparel and growth in some of the key hardlines categories. So it really was across the board. The only area of softness was the cold weather didn't come as we had hoped it would, and so there was some softness in outerwear. But across the board, really strong growth in our core categories. \n I'll turn it to Navdeep for the next question. Robby, thanks for the question. We're not guiding to digital versus in-store overall. In the fourth quarter, transactions were flat and most of the growth came from ticket. However, it's really important to note that, in Q4 of last year, we were up over 7.6% in transactions. So from a 2-year basis on an omnichannel standpoint, really, really strong growth in transactions. Digital business remains really strong, but we're not going to get into more detail than that. Overall, this year, we did have -- the majority of growth did come from transaction growth, if you look at the 2.4%. So we are very confident in our comp guidance. Yes. And the stores are fulfilling over 80% of e-com orders, 90% of orders across the board, if you include the brick-and-mortar. So it's appropriate to think of it as omnichannel sales. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we do feel that we are appropriately reserved for shrink. We've been doing significantly more inventory pulses and I do believe that we have an appropriate reserve going forward. In Q1, it's important to note that we are still up against the headwind of the fact that we didn't put the extra shrink reserve in until the end of Q2 last year. \n But overall, we're doing a lot of things in store to mitigate. We're working with loss prevention and local law enforcement as well as moving products to the back of the store that are high shrink. So we have a lot going on. But overall, we are appropriately reserved. Brian, I really think the transaction growth has so much to do with things like our differentiated product and the access that we have. But on top of that, when athletes are coming into our stores, our team -- or shopping online, our team is striving to make that omnichannel athlete experience, really satisfy, and they're making great progress there. And then also, I think the brand and the fact that we are a brand that is very much based in our values, and we continue to talk about the power of sports. So all of those things are working together and driving strong transactions. John, it's also -- it's across the board. It's not -- there isn't just a softlines story here. We are focused on margin gains across the entire portfolio. Thanks, Joe. I mean, we are gaining market share due to our differentiated experience, the reimagining of our portfolio, the experience we're providing. I think it's coming from a lot of places. And as we continue to get differentiated access to product, I believe it will continue to come. Thanks, everybody, and thanks for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And I want to give a shout out to our 50,000 teammates who really are the reason that we are driving these incredible results. \n Thank you all very much. See you next quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with some highlights of our full year 2023 results, which was a 53-week year. Consolidated sales increased 5% to $12.98 billion, which included $170 million from the 53rd week. On a 52-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.4%, and we continue to gain market share. Our comps were driven by a 1.6% increase in transaction and a 0.8% increase in average ticket. \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit for the full year was $4.55 billion or 35.01% of net sales, an increase of 36 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by lower supply chain costs, which leveraged 80 basis points. This was partially offset by lower merchandise margin of 53 basis points, which was entirely due to higher shrink. To be clear, absent the headwind from shrink, our merchandise margin would have been flat. . \n Non-GAAP EBT was $1.4 billion or 10.8% of net sales, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.91, which included $0.19 from the 53rd week. On a 52-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $12.72. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.04 in 2022, an increase of 5.6% on a 52- to 52-week basis.  \n I will remind you that our 2023 tax rate was lower than our typical tax rate driven by the favorable impact of vesting of employee equity awards and exercises during the year. This positively impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.44 compared to the prior year.  \n As we have discussed on our prior calls, to continue fueling our long-term growth, during the second half of 2023, we took actions to better align our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most critical strategies while also streamlining our overall cost structure. This included actions to change our resourcing and organizational structure, primarily at our customer support center, as well as the optimization of our outdoor specialty business.  \n As part of this, we integrated operations of Moosejaw into Public Lands and made decisions about the go-forward outdoor inventory assortment consistent with our prior expectations. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of our store portfolio with respect to our outdoor specialty business. \n We completed our business optimization review during the fourth quarter. In total, we incurred pretax charges of $84.8 million for the full year 2023. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $12.18. For additional details, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of the press release issued this morning.  \n Now moving to our results for Q4, which also included the extra week. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.8% to $3.88 billion, which included $170 million from the 53rd week. On a 13-week comparable basis, this was the largest sales quarter in the history of the company. Also on a 13-week comparable basis, our comps increased 2.8% on top of a 5.3% increase in the same period last year. \n Our strong comps were driven by a 2.8% increase in average ticket on flat transactions. Within our portfolio, we were very pleased with the performance of our key holiday categories, modestly offset by the performance of our outerwear business due to warm weather.  \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in fourth quarter was $1.34 billion or 34.57% of net sales, and expanded 213 basis points compared to last year. This year-over-year expansion was a sequential improvement from Q3 and in line with our expectations. Gross margin expansion for Q4 was driven by higher merchandise margin of 124 basis points as well as lower supply chain costs and leverage on occupancy costs. This increase in merchandise margin was primarily driven by the quality of our assortment and favorable sales mix. This was partially offset by higher shrink of approximately 50 basis points, in line with prior quarter.  \n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 12.6% to $915.8 million or 23.63% of net sales and deleveraged 102 basis points compared to last year. As we have highlighted on prior calls, the year-over-year deleverage in fourth quarter and throughout 2023 was driven by investments in our hourly wage rate, talent and technology to create better athlete experience as well as investments in marketing. Savings from our business optimization actions helped to offset these investments. Driven by our strong sales and higher gross margin, non-GAAP EBT in the fourth quarter was $427.7 million, 11.03% of net sales. This is up from non-GAAP EBT of $350.5 million or 9.74% of net sales in Q4 of 2022. \n In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter of $3.85, which included $0.19 from 53rd week. On a 13-week comparable basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.66. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.93 in 2022, an increase of 24.9% on a 13- to 13-week basis.  \n During the quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $32.3 million related to our business optimization. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.57. For additional details, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of the press release issued this morning.  \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our year-end inventory levels increased 1% compared to last year. We believe our inventory is clean and well positioned. And in fact, our clearance penetration ended the year amongst the lowest it's ever been.  \n Turning to our fourth quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $151 million, and we paid $81 million in quarterly dividends.  \n Now moving to outlook. In 2024, we expect to grow both sales and profitability. Consolidated sales are expected to be in the range of $13 billion to $13.13 billion. We anticipate comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. EBT margin is planned to be at 10.9% at the midpoint. We anticipate gross margins to be approximately 35% and in line with 2023 non-GAAP results. Within this, we expect merchandise margin to expand modestly, offset by occupancy deleverage as we invest to reposition the portfolio. SG&A expenses are expected to leverage modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results, driven by our ongoing focus on improving productivity and reducing discretionary costs as well as the expected benefits from our business optimization actions. \n We anticipate full year earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12.85 to $13.25. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%.  \n As we model 2024, I want to point out a few things that we expect to impact comparability of our financial results. First, keep in mind that the extra week in 2023 will create a shifted calendar. As a result, when we report our comp sales results, we will compare week 1 through 52 in 2024 with week 2 through 53 in 2023. We do not expect this shift to have a material impact on comp sales for the full year. However, we do expect our reported sales to be positively impacted by the shifted calendar in the first half with an offset in the second half.  \n During the first quarter, we will be investing in several exciting brand campaigns as well as support our Q1 House of Sport grand openings. Next, as a reminder, in Q1, we will see an unfavorable impact to our gross margin from higher shrink rates which we will anniversary starting in Q2. And finally, recall that our Q1 2023 tax rate was meaningfully lower than normal, driven by favorable impact of the vesting of employee equity awards and exercises. We do not anticipate this again in 2024.  \n I'll now discuss our capital allocation priorities. Investing in our business to drive profitable organic growth remains our top priority. And as Lauren said, in 2024, we will increase our capital investment to drive our business forward.  \n For 2024, our capital allocation plan includes net capital expenditure of approximately $800 million. As we continue to reposition our portfolio, these investments will be concentrated in store growth, relocations and improvements in our existing stores, along with ongoing investments in technology and supply chain expansion. Our 2024 CapEx plan also includes purchase of certain real estate assets related to House of Sport, for which we are evaluating potential sale-leaseback opportunities.  \n House of Sport is one of the most exciting concepts in retail today. And in 2024, we expect to open eight new locations. As we elevate our store portfolio, seven of these are planned relocations or conversions of existing DICK'S stores, along with one new store at Prudential Center in Boston. We expect to begin construction on approximately 15 House of Sport locations that are scheduled to open throughout 2025. \n We will also open 16 next-generation 50,000 DICK'S stores in 2024. As part of this, we will relocate or remodel 12 existing DICK'S stores into this innovative new format and open 4 new locations. Across our footprint, we will add approximately 50 premium full-service footwear decks, taking this elevated athlete appearance to nearly 90% of our DICK'S locations.  \n In 2024, we are also excited to grow the footprint of our Golf Galaxy business and plan to open 10 Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. As part of this, we will relocate or remodel five existing Golf Galaxy stores into this immersive new format and open five new Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. \n Through these investments, we expect to increase our square footage by approximately 2% in 2024, marking our most significant expansion since 2017. Lastly, we plan to begin construction on a new regional distribution center opening in 2026. This new DC will play an important role in supporting the long-term growth of our business.  \n Before continuing, I want to share why we are so excited about these investments, especially the House of Sport and our next-generation 50k DICK'S locations. As you will see on the slide, for a new House of Sport, in year 1, we expect approximately $35 million in omnichannel sales and a very strong profitability with a target of approximately 20% EBITDA margins. In terms of capital, it will take about $11.5 million of net CapEx to open a House of Sport location, resulting in an expected year 1 cash-on-cash return of approximately 35%. \n We also expect attractive returns from our next-generation 50,000 DICK'S store investments, where we are targeting approximately $14 million in year 1 omnichannel sales and a comparable EBITDA margin of approximately 20%.  \n We also remain committed to returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. During 2023, we returned $1 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in the profitable long-term growth of our business. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to a healthy balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.  \n Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends of 10% on an annualized payout of $4.40 per share or $1.10 on a quarterly basis. This is on top of a 105% increase last year and marks the 10th consecutive year that our shareholders have benefited from a dividend increase. In addition, our 2024 plan includes our expectation for share repurchases of $300 million, which is included in our EPS guidance. As always, we will optically look at additional share repurchases throughout the year.  \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Lauren to review some of the key initiatives that will drive our profitable growth in 2024 and over the long term. I mean, I'll just build on what Lauren said. If you look at it, right, it's $140 billion overall industry, which is highly fragmented. And what we reiterated today is our core strategies are working really well, and we actually gained almost 50 basis points of our market share over 2023. So really exciting about the results we are posting as well as the core strategy and how those core strategies are resonating with our athletes. Adrienne, thanks for the question. So really pleased with the overall inventory and the quality of the inventory that we finished 2023 with. Our inventory grew just about 1% on top of a 5% growth in sales. And as we reiterated this morning, that the focus that we have of keeping our inventory clean and well positioned is a core tenet and a core strategy of the company, and that is what is allowing us to continue to differentiate our results versus our competition. \n And in terms of our expectations for 2024, like Lauren said, there is so much of innovative and newness available to us in the market, not only from the national brands, but also from the emerging brands. So looking deeper into it and really excited about the spring assortment as well as the more assortment that we see coming into our stores, both in House of Sport and in the next-gen 50,000 locations. Yes, Chris, first of all, really excited to be able to share the economics of our House of Sport location and the 50,000, our next-gen store. This has been something that has been requested for a while, but we wanted to make sure we had enough maturity as well as enough time behind us to be able to share these economics. \n So let's start with the top line. Really great to see, first of all, our stores open at full maturity because of the strong brand awareness and the brand positioning that we have in these markets. The House of Sport locations are opening on an omnichannel basis, almost about a $35 million in top line sales and almost about $14 million when it comes to the next-gen 50,000. \n And like I think that you called it out, that we have a comparable EBITDA margins between both these boxes. And as you can expect, there's a little bit of an interplay that happens between the margin and the SG&A. You have a little bit more of the elevated experience being provided in House of Sport locations, and so therefore, there is a little bit of a higher service level component of it. But the service also comes with the revenue associated with this, so there's a little bit of a higher margin you get from that. \n I would say -- and I think that you called out occupancy. There's a little bit of a more capital investment that we are putting into it, so that plays into the depreciation. But when you look at the overall, just the operating -- or the EBITDA margin rates that we are driving, we are very, very happy with the returns that we are driving and the strong profitability that we are delivering out of both these boxes. Yes. Chris, I will build on what we have been saying, that the financial returns are great, but what is even better is how well this overall concept is resonating not only with our brand partners, with our athletes and also with the community. And that's what we see as a long-term driver of the differentiation of getting better access, getting more allocated product available to us, having the emerging brands come to us and want to partner with us in these really, really experiential destinations. And that is what we consider as a true differentiator DICK'S Sporting Goods. Yes. So a few comments that we gave out in our prepared comments today. First of all, I'll start with the sales, right? We're going to have a shifted calendar, so there will be a little bit of an impact to our total top line sales total revenue, but not a significant impact when you think around a shifted basis on comp. \n What we did call out was just a reminder, we saw the elevated levels of shrink in Q2 of 2023. So in Q1, we haven't lapped that as yet. So as you all are modeling, it will be helpful to keep that in mind. The other is the tax rate. If you remember, our tax rate in Q1 was significantly low compared to our normalized tax rate, and you will see that piece play out as well. \n And finally, hopefully, you all have watched some of the exciting brand campaigns that we have going on right now between brand campaigns associated with our launch of our CALIA Inspire collection, our dicks.com campaign. And so we are investing into that. In addition, we're going to be opening two really exciting House of Sport locations here in Q1 between Ross Park Mall here in Pittsburgh and at Prudential Center. So you will see some of the investments associated with those two stores in Q1 as well. So a slightly elevated levels of preopening expense, maybe I'll just put a finer point on that one. Yes. Kate, in terms of the comp guidance, overall, like we said, because of the shifted calendar, no material impact to the comp cadence itself when you look at it. However, keep in mind, last year, we were converting eight combo locations into House of Sport which were closed during the first half of last year. So we expect our comp in the first half to be slightly stronger than the comps in the back half of the year. No. We're not doing the closed remodels as we did last year. Yes, Robby, we won't break that down any further. I'm really excited about -- to be able to guide on a positive basis on top of a 2.4% comp from last year. And our focus is continuing to be about driving sales and profitability growth for the business. Yes. No, Robby, that's exactly that. It's not only the stores that are fulfilled from a store with an athlete walking in. Even an omnichannel sale or a digital sale that gets fulfilled by the store is also included in that because that's what we look as the 4-wall performance of the store, including the work that our team members are doing in fulfilling an omnichannel order. Thank you. Yes, Brian, I'll add to the fact that, if you look at it in 2023 and in fourth quarter, we gained 7 million new athletes in 2023. And just in fourth quarter alone, we gained 2 million new athletes. So back to Lauren's point, the athlete database that we have, the work that we have been doing around personalization and the loyalty and our scorecard program, in addition to having the right product, our ability to be able to go and address and discuss those type of features and product availability in our store is resonating very well as well with our athletes. Yes. John, I think that's a 2-part question there, so I'll start with the second part in terms of the comp contribution as we look at the growth in the second year. And that has been one of the questions. We are very optimistic and confident in the results that we are seeing. \n So first of all, we don't have a large sample. There are two stores of our stores that were opened in 2021 and 2022. They actually have comped the second full year. And what we saw was, in 2023, they actually posted comp sales growth again in year 2. So really happy with the overall performance. \n In terms of the comp contribution and so the opportunities when we are relocating, let's say, a 50,000 or an 80,000 box that goes from somewhere to $19 million to $20 million going to closer to a $35 million omnichannel sales, that's the comp contribution that we are really excited about as well. \n And then -- and I would be remiss if I didn't add the differentiated product that we are able to get through these things, through the next-gen 50,000 or House or Sport location, that allows us to cascade that innovation and newness down into our -- into the normal DICK'S stores as well, is allowing us to continue to elevate the overall portfolio of the stores and the performance that we are seeing out of those. Yes. So John, I would say that the overall -- the composition of the product continues to be the biggest driver of our merch margin expansion when you look at it versus 2019. And we are confident that, that will continue to be one of the biggest drivers. \n The two other drivers that we talk about internally a lot is our excitement about the vertical brand work. And hopefully, you've seen some of the work that we have recently launched in terms of the CALIA Inspire product that we launched here in 2024. The DSG brand is resonating really well with our athletes. We actually have now an always-on kind of a message around DSG brand. So the softline vertical brand product is resonating really well with our athletes. \n So the vertical brand and continuing to lean into that with moving towards the $2 billion long-term goal that we have will be another big driver of the margin in the recent years as well as we look forward on a go-forward basis. And finally, we are constantly elevating our -- some of the promotional optimization and pricing optimization capabilities as well. So we'll continue to lean into the same things that we have leaned on, and really confident about the differentiated product. Yes, Joe, like you called out in 2023, we saw the tailwind from the freight. As we look to 2024, we are not expecting any kind of tailwind or headwind right now. But to your point, we are definitely evaluating the evolving situation that we have across the world right now. But overall, we feel great about the inventory position, and we'll continue to monitor how the overall situations evolve. Yes. Warren, we are excited, I would say, across the board, right? Our partnership with the national brands is an all-time high. We continue to differentiate not only our service levels, but the experience that we provide within our stores. \n And the national brands, all of them want to be rooted in sports. So when they look to a partner that can not only bring their full assortment and breadth of product to life, but actually can bring that across -- bring that to life across the nation, we are the destination for that. So we continue to see a very strong level of partnership and interest and the innovation and newness that is coming into our stores. \n Likewise, we are very excited about some of the emerging brands like On and HOKA and Free People Movement. And we see the opportunity not only to continue to have a deeper partnership with these brands, but also expand that relationship deeper into our own chain. \n And finally, the work that our vertical brand team has done is phenomenal, really excited about the launches that we have done this year and what more is to come in 2024. Yes. Warren, today, we are not going to be providing a long-term algorithm. But what we have consistently said is and what we are consistently delivering is the fact that we are confident in driving the long-term sales and profitability of the company leaning into the core strategies that Lauren has laid it out today. So we'll continue to execute and confident in the guidance that we have provided to be able to drive positive comps in 2024 on top of a strong 2.4% comp that we posted in '23. Yes, Mike, we continue to be really excited about the outdoor category. When you look at it at the macro level, this is a $40 billion highly fragmented TAM that is out there. And we know there is an opportunity to similarly differentiate in terms of service, product experience as well as the overall assortment that we can provide. \n So what we have done in 2023, we've acquired Moosejaw and the work that we did last year was actually bringing the back office operation of Moosejaw and Public Lands together to be able to drive the long-term profitability in that business. And what we have called out in the business optimization actions are actually rationalizing some of the investments that we have made. \n We are not -- we are closing Moosejaw locations, but we are confident in the go-forward business, and we'll continue to evaluate that space. But overall, on a long-term basis, continue to remain really confident about the opportunity in the outdoor segment. Yes. Actually, Mike, on both these metrics are in the slide that will be there on our Investor Relations webpage, both the net capital investment, inventory, as well as the preopening and then the cash-on-cash return. We appreciate the flexibility on joining us early here."

[Operator Instructions] And please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\n And now, at this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Nate Gilch, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nNathaniel Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2023 results.

We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which demonstrate the ongoing strength of our business and the focused execution of our team. We had a very strong back-to-school season, driven by our best-in-class athlete experience and differentiated assortment. And we continue to gain market share as consumers prioritize DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet their needs. \n Our third quarter sales increased 2.8% to $3.04 billion and our comps increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both transactions and average ticket. This strong comp was on top of a 6.5% increase from the same period last year. And during the quarter, we saw more athletes purchase from us while spending more each trip. \n On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 gross margin expanded by 88 basis points versus the prior year period. And looking to Q4, we expect to see continued year-over-year gross margin expansion. We achieved double-digit non-GAAP EBT margin of 10.6% and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.85, up 10% over Q3 last year. \n As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our full year outlook. Our updated guidance balances the confidence we have in our key strategies with an acknowledgment of the uncertain macroeconomic environment. For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $12 to $12.60 compared to our prior expectation of $11.50 to $12.30. In addition, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 2% compared to our prior expectation of flat to positive 2%. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.4%. \n We have a tremendous long-term growth opportunity ahead of us, and are making strategic investments that position us well for growth and enable us to continue gaining share in a large, fragmented industry. These investments include accelerating innovation in our omnichannel athlete experience and expanding our new concepts like House of Sport and our new 50,000 square foot prototype which are resonating exceptionally well with our athletes. \n As we outlined on our last call, we've done extensive work to optimize our business so we can capture the opportunity ahead of us. This includes better aligning our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most significant growth opportunities while also streamlining our overall cost structure. \n First, as we discussed last quarter, we are resourcing DICK'S for growth and refocusing our team on our 4 key strategic pillars of differentiated products, athlete experience, teammate experience, and brand engagement. Second, we are optimizing our outdoor specialty business. This primarily includes integrating the operations of Moosejaw and Public Lands to enhance our ability to fulfill outdoor athlete demand more effectively. This new structure immediately improves operational efficiency and strategically positions this business for profitable growth within the $40 billion outdoor industry. Navdeep will share more details about our business optimization plans, including the expected SG&A benefits and the charges related to executing these plans. \n Innovating within the omnichannel athlete experience is at the heart of our growth strategies. Our newest DICK'S concepts have proven to be tremendously successful and are a key part of our future as we continue to reimagine our store portfolio and footprint. \n First, we continue to be pleased with the results from our DICK'S House of Sport locations. We opened 2 new Houses of Sport at the beginning of Q3 and now have a total of 12 locations open, 9 of which we opened this year. We're excited to open approximately 10 additional locations throughout 2024, including at the Prudential Center in Boston as well as locations in Pittsburgh, Miami and Tampa. We continue to expect that by 2027, we will have between 75 to 100 across the country. \n In addition to House of Sport, we're rolling out our next-generation DICK'S store, which revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot format. During Q3, we're excited to have opened another 5 locations. And earlier this month, we opened 3 more. With a total of 11 next-generation locations now open, we are pleased with the performance and confident in the long-term opportunity of this new 50,000 square foot prototype. \n We're also growing our Golf Galaxy footprint through Golf Galaxy Performance Center, an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels. During Q3, we opened 7 new Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, expanding our Golf Galaxy chain to 104 locations, including 13 Performance Centers. We believe there is a significant long-term growth opportunity in golf. Over the next 4 years, we expect to have as many as 40 to 50 Golf Galaxy Performance Centers across the U.S., including approximately 10 new locations in 2024. \n In combination with our stores, our digital experience remains an integral part of our success and the investments we are making in technology are strengthening our athletes' omnichannel experience and driving increased engagement. This quarter, we added 1.6 million new athletes and are further growing our base of omnichannel athletes. Omnichannel athletes make up the majority of our sales, and they spend more and shop with us more frequently than single-channel athletes. As we invest in data science and personalization, we're excited to continue building one-to-one relationships and better serving these athletes. \n We remain focused on ensuring DICK'S is a convenient one-stop shop and have enhanced our multiple delivery and pickup options by expanding same-day delivery. In fact, athletes can now filter online for same-day delivery. And this holiday season, we will offer same-day delivery service up until 12 noon on Christmas Eve for last-minute gifting. \n In closing, we're very pleased with our strong third quarter results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. We're excited for the upcoming holiday season and the product, service and experience we're providing to our athletes. \n I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods and for their upcoming efforts during the fourth quarter. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail. \nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results. We are very pleased to report consolidated sales increase 2.8% to $3.04 billion as we continued to gain market share. Comp store sales increased 1.7% on top of a 6.5% increase in the same period last year. Our strong comps were driven by a 1.1% increase in transactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket. Collectively, our back-to-school categories did very well and we're pleased with the results from our House of Sport locations. Our noncomp sales growth of roughly 110 basis points this quarter was primarily driven by sales at Moosejaw. \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in the third quarter was $1.07 billion or 35.1% of net sales and improved 88 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by lower supply chain costs, which leveraged 78 basis points. Merchandise margin increased 23 basis points and as expected, this increase was primarily driven by anniversary of our clearance activity from last year and partially offset by higher shrink of approximately 50 basis points. To be clear, absent the shrink headwind, our merchandise margin would have increased over 70 basis points. [ Combating theft ] remains a top priority, and we continue to invest in efforts to keep our stores, teammates and athletes safe. \n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expense increased $50.1 million to $729.9 million and deleveraged 102 basis points compared to last year. This was favorable versus our expectation due to better-than-expected sales, targeted actions to control discretionary costs and benefits from our business optimization actions. \n As we have highlighted on prior calls, the year-over-year deleverage this quarter was driven by our investments in our base rate, talent and technology to create a better athlete experience as well as investments in marketing. These areas of investments were partially offset by $8.2 million of expense reduction or 26 basis points of leverage associated with changes in the investment value of our deferred compensation plan, which is fully offset in other income. \n Interest expense was $14.4 million, a decrease of $11.7 million compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to the inducement charges incurred in the prior year related to the exchange of our convertible senior notes and the interest savings this year from the retirement of those notes. \n Other income totaled $10.1 million compared to $4.8 million in the same period last year. This $5.3 million increase in income was driven by a $13.3 million increase in interest income as a result of higher average interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents. This increase to other income was partially offset by $8.2 million expense increase from change in the value of our deferred compensation plans, which fully offsets the SG&A expense reduction I mentioned earlier. \n Driven by our strong sales, higher gross margin, along with lower interest expense, non-GAAP EBT was $321.1 million or 10.6% of net sales. This compares to an EBT of $304.2 million or 10.3% of net sales in 2022. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60 last year, an increase of 10%. \n As Lauren said, to continue fueling our long-term growth, we have optimized our organization to better align our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most critical strategies while also streamlining our overall cost structure. \n First, we are resourcing DICK'S for growth. As we have discussed -- as we discussed on our last call, during the third quarter, we took actions to change our resourcing and organizational structure, primarily at our customer support center. \n Second, we are taking steps to optimize our outdoor specialty business and are forming one team that will support the operations of Public Lands and Moosejaw. This will allow us to quickly leverage the best practices across our outdoor specialty business to drive growth while operating more efficiently. \n We started to see the SG&A benefits from these actions during the third quarter and expect to see continued benefits into Q4 and 2024. These actions, along with our overall focus on improving productivity and reducing discretionary costs will help enable us to significantly moderate our SG&A expense growth in 2024 as compared to this year. \n As a result of these actions, we incurred pretax charges totaling $52.5 million during the third quarter. This included a $6.3 million of inventory-related write-down associated with rationalization of non-go-forward Moosejaw inventory. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.39. For additional details on this, you can refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 2% compared to Q3 of last year. Our inventory is well positioned, and we are excited about our assortment for the holiday season. \n Turning to our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $151 million and we paid $81 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $388.1 million at an average price of $112.46. Year-to-date, we have returned over $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \n Let me wrap up with our outlook for 2023. As Laura noted, as a result of our Q3 performance, we are raising our full year outlook. We are confident in our key strategies and are well positioned to execute against what is in our control. At the same time, we are being appropriately cautious, particularly at the low end of our expectations, considering the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. \n For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $12 to $12.60 compared to our prior expectation of $11.50 to $12.30. This continues to include approximately $0.20 coming from the 53rd week. In addition, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 2% compared to our prior expectation of flat to positive 2%. Including the 53rd week, we expect roughly 250 basis points of noncomp sales growth for the full year. Specifically, this includes approximately $150 million in sales from the 53rd week, which is a smaller than average sales week for us. \n At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.4% compared to our prior expectation of 10.2%. We expect modest improvement in gross margin for the full year, which continues to include an approximate 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher shrink compared to 2022. \n Specific to Q4, we expect to deliver continued gross margin and merch margin expansion on a year-over-year basis with some improvement versus our Q3 expansion. We also continue to expect SG&A expenses to deleverage on a full year, primarily due to the proactive investments in our growth strategies. Specific to Q4, we expect SG&A to deleverage by a similar magnitude as the third quarter. \n Our earnings guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 21% and an approximately 86 million average diluted shares outstanding compared to our prior expectation of approximately 87 million average diluted shares outstanding. In addition, we expect net capital expenditures between $550 million to $600 million for the year. As part of our business optimization, we incurred pretax charges totaling $52.5 million during the third quarter and currently expect to incur charges of approximately $10 million in fourth quarter. These charges were excluded from today's non-GAAP outlook. We are still conducting our business optimization review, which we expect to be completed during fiscal 2023. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the comps of the business, which have much better than most retail categories and more resilient over the last couple of years. So you see the detail, you see the product categories, the trends. As you look at this composition and how the consumer is going, I'm trying to assess what the puts and takes are as you look forward. And if you want to share how you think about '24, fine, but more interested in what gives you confidence and what gives you pause. \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. Yes, we are pleased with how our consumer is holding up within the sporting goods industry and then particularly that they're choosing DICK's increasingly to meet their needs. People are prioritizing a healthy and active lifestyle. They're prioritizing team sports, outdoors, living, running, walking, all of those things. And so we felt in this past quarter, particularly pleased of the increase in transactions and ticket. And the fact that our consumers are not trading down, that our consumer has held up very, very well.\n So as we look into Q4, as you've heard in our guidance, we are very excited about what we have within our control for Q4. Our products are in stock. We've got tremendous gifts. And if you look at LinkedIn, I know you follow DSG -- #dsglife, but you'll see what we call Reindeer Runs going on all across the country, and the teams are pumped to deliver an amazing holiday experience. \n We're balancing all of that with caution about the macroeconomic environment and the consumer because we know that consumers are going through a lot right now. So I think we've been reasonably cautious in our guidance, but we're very excited about how our consumers are holding this up. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. I'll shift the follow-up to gross margin, although I have some more on top line but do it offline. The -- on the gross margin, so in the last 2 years, last year you had -- you worked with a vendor to move some inventory. This year, you had some outdoor markdowns. So if you think about gross margins rebasing, do you look at those events as anomalies and you recapture that margin? Or is this level the right baseline that gives you flexibility and then you could offer some upside from here? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. I think it's important when you look at the gross margin to understand that our product mix has become increasingly differentiated. And as a result of that, one of our core operating philosophies is always to be very decisive and move inventory so that we can make room for clean and fresh receipts. And that is really what -- that's what drove our comp this past quarter and what's been driving our comp for some time. \n Last year, what you're mentioning, there were a few unusual events. There was a lump in outdoor equipment related to the pandemic. There was a lump in like apparel related to the pandemic. That is not the story of this quarter. This quarter, we are very happy with the inventory that we're bringing in. And we move decisively to move the product that's in the stores through to clearance and to outdoor into online channels that we could make room to have an amazing Q4 and amazing holiday season. \n I do think that's what drove our comps. And I would remind you that we are still -- you take out the impact of shrink, we are still 50% higher on a merch margin basis from where we were before. So we're very proud of where we are from a gross margin standpoint and expect it to continue to improve. \nOperator: We go next now to Robby Ohmes at Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Great quarter. Just -- really just two questions. The first was just on House of Sport. Any more color you can give on how the ones that are comping are comping? And also, is the store economic model outlook improving? You mentioned the Prudential Center in Boston. I'm assuming you might be getting great lease rates on that relative to that location. Maybe some thoughts on that.\n And then the second question is just Going, Going, Gone! and pop-up stores, can you tell us what kind of role that they played in noncomp sales in the third quarter and how you're thinking about those for the fourth quarter? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robby. I'll start, and I'll turn it over to Navdeep. House of Sport stores are performing very, very well. And I think it's important to note that as much as we got a positive impact from those stores, both the first 3 that we opened more than a year ago and the new stores that just opened in the past 6 months, we also had growth across the balance of our portfolio and our omnichannel business as well. So it was a very balanced portfolio, which we're very happy with from a comp standpoint.\n The economics of House of Sport are very good. I'll turn it over to Navdeep to talk about how our lease rates and such. We're probably not going to get into that. But we have a very high standard for how we look at our real estate investments, and we don't do anything unless we hurdle a certain amount of ROI. So Navdeep, anything you would add? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Robby, thanks for your comments. And as far as the House of Sport is concerned, like we have talked about -- we continue to be, first of all, pleased with the performance of the 12 stores that we have opened. And the benefit is not just coming from an economic point of view, which is also great, but we are also seeing our ability to be able to attract new brands and new partners that are coming to showcase their product at House of Sport location. And we feel Prudential Center will be another kind of that top-notch location where the brands would love to showcase their product. We'll share more details about the economics of these boxes when we share our 2024 expectations because we -- our plan is to open 10 additional locations in '24. \n Coming to your question about Going, Going, Gone!, the Going, Going, Gone! chain and the warehouse plus locations, as we call them, continue to play a very important role in our overall clearance strategy. Like Lauren talked about, the core differentiator for us continues to be the product assortment that we have available to drive the engaged relationship with our athletes. We are seeing our assortment resonate really well with the athletes. And having fresh and new vibrant assortment available in stores is a key part of that strategy. And Going, Going, Gone! allows us to move any excess or clearance inventory very efficiently into those locations and get a much better economic return than we were able to get in the past. \n In terms of the noncomp impact, it didn't have a significant noncomp impact because the number of stores that we had in Q3 this year are very comparable to the number of stores that we had last year. So 58 stores this year compared to, call it, 56 stores last year in Q3. So it's a very comparable view. The noncomp benefit in the Q3 of this year was driven by the Moosejaw business. \nRobert Ohmes: Got you. That's helpful. And just Navdeep for 4Q, do you expect sort of similar number stores versus last year for Going, Going, Gone! and [indiscernible]? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. We expect similar store count to be because we feel like we have reached a good point of where we can operate those number of stores very efficiently. The noncomp in fourth quarter will be Moosejaw as well as the 53rd week, as we have called out. \nOperator: Moving next now to Kate McShane at Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if you could talk to any category performance during the quarter, just maybe how apparel and footwear looked relative to the second quarter year-over-year? And are you seeing any stabilization in some of the bigger ticket categories that maybe were COVID beneficiary categories a couple of years ago? \nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Kate. Yes, the story in Q3 from a category level really was about the strength of our back-to-school business. We saw strength as back-to-school has different cycles throughout the country, early, mid and late back-to-school, and we could literally see the comps follow those trends. The back-to-school categories were performing so well. So collectively, that is footwear and apparel and hydration, which is doing incredibly well and then other accessories like backpacks, socks and those sorts of things. So we're very pleased with -- overall, how our key categories performed in Q3. \n Looking at the higher ticket, the COVID categories, I want to just remind you, they are a smaller percentage of our business. And across the board, they remain significantly higher than our pre-COVID levels. We do expect long-term growth in those categories. We're just managing through them. But they are a small percentage of our business relative to the rest. \nKatharine McShane: And if we could just have a follow-up question with regard to your commentary around House of Sport [indiscernible] brands. Can you talk at all as to what those are and maybe how the brand distribution or just what brands they're carrying? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, sure. I think House of Sport is unique in that it is totally rooted in sport, and it's a fantastic destination for all of our brands. So if you look at some of our bigger brand partners, it's one of the best presentations -- they've said, one of the best presentations of their brands that they see. It's also an opportunity because of the size and the level of service where we can bring in new and emerging brands. And through that channel, we brought in brands like FP Movement and On and HOKA. And so -- and those then have ability to transfer down to the rest of the chain as we become partners. \n So our vertical brands also have incredible presence in our House of Sport stores. We lead with them across the board in many of our entrances and they're doing quite well, too. So overall, just -- it's a fantastic presentation and really puts brands in their best light. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Mike Baker at D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. So a couple of margin questions. One, you talked about SG&A growing less next year. Have you -- can you talk about what your breakeven comp is in terms of SG&A? What kind of comp do you need next year to leverage your SG&A? And maybe along the same lines, what kind of comp you need for total EBT margins to be up, in other words, incorporating what might go on in gross margin in that as well? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the Q3 performance that we saw in the SG&A. So the SG&A came in -- from a rate perspective, it's still deleveraged, 100 basis points, but it was lower than the expectation that we had given at the end of Q2, driven by three primary things. \n First, the top line came in at the higher end of our expectations. So we're very pleased with the productivity that we were able to drive from just the leverage on the higher level of top line performance. \n Second, really, really focused about the work that got done within the collective organization to be able to drive productivity and efficiency pretty much in the discretionary areas, away from the core strategies of the company. So you saw the results of that manifest through the P&L that we delivered. And then some of the actions that we undertook here in the business optimization, the early parts of those benefits were also in Q3. And we expect a similar outlook as we shared for Q4. We expect SG&A to deleverage in the similar zone as where the deleverage in Q3 came in. \n In terms of 2024, here's the way I'll say it because we are not ready to provide guidance as yet for 2024, but here's a framework to think about it. The business optimization actions that we have taken, particularly in the Moosejaw and Public Lands businesses being brought together, that benefit will continue into 2024. And that's the reason we said our SG&A will significantly moderate in terms of the growth as we go into '24. \n In addition, the work that we are doing currently and have done in the discretionary cost area in Q3 and in Q4, we expect that benefit also to continue into 2024. So we'll share more at the next earnings call about '24 expectations, including the top line and the SG&A and the profitability expectation. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Fair enough. One other, I guess, follow-up but candidly, a different topic. Historically, in a lot of ways, back-to-school is a very good leading indicator for holiday sales. You had a very good back-to-school. Historically, in your business, have you seen that kind of correlation between holiday sales and back-to-school? \nNavdeep Gupta: I would say what we are really pleased is the fact that our consumer is holding up really well. We are seeing growth both in our transaction and in our ticket. And as Lauren indicated, we have not seen any trade downs, and all income demographics across our portfolio actually grew. \n However, the competitive set in holidays is different than back-to-school season. So we are very optimistic about the things that are within our control, our assortment, our service levels as well as the experience in the stores are ready to serve our athletes. And we couldn't be more excited about the holiday season. \nMichael Baker: Great. Fair enough. Look forward to seeing the new store in the Prudential Center up here in Boston. \nLauren Hobart: Us, too. \nNavdeep Gupta: Us, too. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Warren Cheng at Evercore ISI. \nWarren Cheng: Just to follow up on your answer to Simeon's question on the 4Q comp. So the guidance implies a deceleration from the 1.7% from 3Q. So if we use that 3Q 1.7% level as an anchor, the compares get easier going in the fourth quarter on both the year-over-year and multiyear basis. It sounds like the inventories are well stocked. 3Q had some unseasonal weather. So as we think about that 3Q to 4Q sequential slowdown, are there factors that we should consider? Or is that entirely just the macro caution that you talked about? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Warren, we are being conservative on the low end of our guidance just given -- Navdeep just said, first of all, we compete with everyone in the world during the fourth quarter. And also, the consumer is going through an awful lot and we're just going -- we're trying to be cautious. And so I wouldn't read into anything other than we are trying to model in an appropriate level of caution due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. \nWarren Cheng: Got it. And then a follow-up on margins. So just on freight, I think it flipped to a big tailwind around third quarter or fourth quarter last year. How should we think about the spillover into 4Q and 2024? \n And then also just on -- to round up the gross margin piece, how should we think about occupancy expense growth in next year as you sort of ramp up Golf Galaxy and Public -- sorry, Golf Galaxy and House of Sport? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, I'll stay away from 2024 guidance. We'll provide that at the next quarter. But I'll -- maybe I'll answer your first part of the question. In terms of the freight expenses, I would say that the freight expenses, to your point, did start to moderate in terms of the growth last year. It's also -- we started to see the benefits of the lower freight expenses in the back half of last year. And I would say they were a little bit more pronounced into Q4. So if you look at our prepared comments from last year, you will be able to get to a good approximation for the Q4 expectations. \n And about the occupancy, we'll talk about more between House of Sport and Galaxy because that all ties into how we think about the overall operating model. But like Lauren said, the core growth opportunities that we see between the House of Sport locations, the next-gen 50k as well as Golf Galaxy, we are very excited about all of those opportunities, and we'll share more at the next quarter meeting. \nOperator: We go next now to Christopher Horvers at JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So just following up on, you talked about strength in the business. You talked about strength in back-to-school, in demographics and so forth. A lot of retailers have talked about some moderation in October. So is it -- I know you don't give monthlies, but is it fair to say that there was -- the strength was -- the comps were highest around back-to-school season, and then moderated? And then I guess related to that, how are you thinking about how the holiday season plays out? Are we reverting back to like 2019 where sales are very focused around events, whether that's Black Friday and Cyber Monday and then the last 2 weeks for Christmas? \nLauren Hobart: Yes, Chris, so in terms of the strength of our quarter, the calendarization of our quarter, you are correct. The back-to-school strength drove significant comps in August and September. We did see a moderation in October of comps, but we also had unfavorable weather, as warmer weather has an impact. So nothing significant. But yes, we saw a moderation in October. \n As we look to the holiday season, obviously, we have the biggest weeks coming up ahead of us, and it will be busy right until December 25. And we are seeing holidays kicking off, and this has been going on now for a few years. Earlier, in November, we've been talking about that for some time. We're seeing it now, and we expect it will be a key 5 or 6 weeks here, and it will be similar timing to what it was before, with events driving a lot of the excitement. \nChristopher Horvers: And then my follow-up is, I just think about innovation in 2024 across different categories. You've had a lot of success this year on having high-heat product. And on the apparel side, you've also had expanded a few key brands around the -- in the footwear category. So thinking about those categories in particular, how are you thinking about innovation as you look at 2024, and maybe as well on the golf side? \nLauren Hobart: We're excited. Generally speaking, we're excited about the innovation in our business. We're excited about the new formats that we're innovating. We're excited about innovation in our service model. And we're excited about the product that we're seeing from many of our brand partners. We think it's going to be very -- it will be a great year from -- without me giving guidance, I'm excited about the product that I'm seeing 2024. \n Innovation across the board, categories get interestingly hot from time to time. It's interesting to see what's happening with hydration in the past few years. There could be other categories that pop next year, but we see really exciting product in all the key categories of apparel and footwear and golf. \nNavdeep Gupta: And maybe I'll add one more point. We still see organic opportunity for us to continue to expand our premium full service footwear decks into the larger part of the overall company portfolio of stores. And as we do that, that opens up more access to brands as well as deeper access within those brands as well. So there are organic actions that we have at our disposal and quite frankly, that have done really well that give us confidence as we look to '24. \nChristopher Horvers: And Navdeep, could you just remind us where you are from a penetration perspective on the footwear decks and where it's going? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, about 75% of the stores today have that capability. \nOperator: We go next now to Michael Lasser at UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Last quarter, you had planned some gross margin pressure to keep your inventories fresh as you move through the course of the year. Have you used more or less of that flexibility than you anticipated? And would consider that now just the cost of doing business that's going to be part of the cost structure moving forward? \nLauren Hobart: Michael, yes, we are -- I would say, one of our core operating philosophies and what is driving our top line sales is our ability to keep our inventory fresh and clean. And especially the more that the inventory has become highly differentiated, it's important to bring it in when it's hot, when it's -- and keep the stores constantly evolving. \n And so we are -- as our gross margin materialized through the quarter, we were slightly more aggressive in terms of moving stuff out, but the environment was slightly more promotional than we had originally expected. But generally speaking, we were decisive just to keep the stores clean. Nothing extraordinary or out of the ordinary, I should say, happened during the quarter. And we're very pleased that we were able to grow gross margin. And as we look to Q4, we are expecting accelerated gains. We're also very pleased with the overall profitability of the business. \nMichael Lasser: And Lauren, your comment that the environment was a bit more promotional than you expected, how does that feed into your expectation for 4Q? And is the fact that your gross margin expansion going to accelerate in this quarter simply a function of an accelerating benefit from the lower freight cost? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Actually, the Q4 gross margin acceleration also factors in the fact that Q4 was a very promotional clearance time as the industry had a glut of apparel last year at this time. And so when we're saying we are looking to Q4, we are seeing some increased promotional activity, we're seeing more [ map breaks ] and we will be participating surgically where and when we feel it's necessary for us to stay competitive. We have factored all of that into our guidance and still expect gross margin to accelerate in Q4. \nNavdeep Gupta: Michael, let me add one more thing. I'll just clarify on the last part of the question. As -- in my prepared comments, I talked about that we expect both the gross profit as well as the merch margin to expand as we go into the fourth quarter. So the merch margin would be on -- like the things that Lauren talked about, would be kind of the annualization of the actions and the capabilities that we have. And to your last part of the question, that lower freight cost benefits would be part of the gross profit. \nOperator: We go next now to Paul Kearney at Barclays. \nPaul Kearney: Just on the promotional conversation, wondering if you can comment on maybe by category, what you're seeing is more promotional. Is it that apparel is just more promotional than you would expect it to be? Or are you seeing promotions elsewhere in the store in footwear and hardlines? And could you comment on the level of vendor support relative to last year? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. In Q4, as I mentioned, we compete with everything from jewelry to appliances to everything that could possibly be a gift. And so the promotions by category are what you would expect. There is -- I wouldn't say there's an area of the store that's more promotional. We're making sure we have hot deals for consumers who are coming in and excited to shop during the holiday season. \n Vendor support, we work ongoing with our vendors. This is a week in, week out, month in, month out. And that -- it's something we're not going to comment on specifically, but continues to be a key part of our operating model. \nPaul Kearney: Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. Could you maybe just refresh us on the capital allocation priority as we think about next year and into the future. Could we be assuming a continuation of share repurchases as part of that strategy? And where does that fall? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Paul, consistent with what we have said, the capital allocation priority continues to remain consistent. We are focused on maintaining an appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet. And the second is to continue to maintain our investment-grade status that we have. And the third priority continues to be invest into the business. And as part of our updated guidance, we have maintained the capital investment expectation of $550 million to $600 million. \n What you saw us do in Q3 is when we see there is an opportunistic or a dislocation in our stock price, we will step in based on where the stock prices and the long-term confidence we have in our company. And we stepped in and bought $388 million worth of stock. And from a return to the shareholders, our priority continues to be able to give a good return in terms of the dividend, which we doubled this year as well as continuing to opportunistically buy back shares. \nOperator: We go next now to Paul Lejuez at Citigroup. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Kelly ] on for Paul. I just want to follow-up on House of Sport stores. I hope you could parse out the performance of some of the newly converted House of Sport stores that are included in the comp base relative to how legacy gift stores performed in the third quarter? And I just have a follow-up. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. [ Kelly ], thanks for that question. Let me clarify one thing. We never took out those stores that were converted into House of Sport out of the comp base. So they were part of our comp base even in the first half of this year. And quite frankly, we had talked about that they were an unfavorable impact as we were converting them.\n In terms of the performance that we have seen from these stores, we couldn't be more excited. There are only eight of them that -- collectively 12 of them, but the original stores are doing really well. The new group of stores are doing extremely well as well. And yes, they had a favorable impact to our comp, but we were very pleased with the overall portfolio of the brick-and-mortar and the omni comp that we were able to deliver. So overall, very pleased with the performance of House of Sport location as well as the core business that we saw in Q3. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. And on the Public Lands-Moosejaw plan, can you just give us an update on how many Public Lands stores you have? And whether your plan for these businesses includes more stores, what's sort of the go-forward plan for that outdoor category outside of the core DICK'S store? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. This is -- let me start on that. First, let's talk a little bit about our overall excitement about the outdoor category. Like we have talked about Moosejaw and Public Lands collectively serve the outdoor athlete, and that industry is a $40 billion highly fragmented industry, but not a clear leader. So as we see the collective capability that we have between the Moosejaw brand as well as the Public Lands brand, we are extremely excited about that opportunity to continue to differentiate and provide a much more synergistic way of serving that athlete as we look forward.\n So what we talked about in Q3 was we were -- as you can imagine, after the acquisition, we are integrating the back-office operations of the Moosejaw and Public Lands team and bringing one team together to serve these athletes. \n In terms of the number of Public Lands stores that we have, we have 7 Public Lands locations right now, and we are excited about the ongoing business that we see here collectively between both these brands. \nUnknown Analyst: Any plans to open more? \nNavdeep Gupta: We'll share more details in 2024. But yes, our plans are to continue testing and learning into this brand and opening more stores as we go look into the future. \nOperator: We'll go next now to John Kernan at TD Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Keeping on the House of Sport theme, how should we think about the contribution to unit growth and top line into next year? And then also, how should we think about the four-wall margin on these stores versus the existing chain? \nNavdeep Gupta: John, I would say, first of all, as we have talked about, most of the 12 stores that we have opened are either a conversion or a relocation of an existing store. So what you're looking here is not a significant expansion in the square footage of the overall company. But what we are seeing is a very differentiated experience that we are able to provide in these stores.\n We'll share more specifics in fourth quarter, but I can give you this that from a sales productivity perspective as well as the contribution perspective, we are very happy with the financial returns that we are delivering on these investments. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on SG&A and some of the cost savings that you're looking at from some of the business optimization initiatives, how should we think about the net savings that you see into 2024 and beyond? \nNavdeep Gupta: So in our prepared comments, what we shared was that we expect our SG&A growth to significantly moderate, especially considering the growth that we have seen in our SG&A this year. But as you can imagine, it's a combination of multiple things. What do we expect the sales growth to be next year. \n But -- so we'll share more, but the framework that I would use is, first of all, the business optimization work that we are doing, especially with bringing the Moosejaw and the Public Lands business together will have continued benefit, actually bigger benefits into 2024, as well as the productivity and the efficiency conversation that we talked about in Q3 and Q4, those actions will continue to kind of help us mitigate the growth in SG&A as we look to the future. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Joe Feldman at Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: Congrats on the quarter. Wanted to go back to the comments you made about weather. And how much of a factor does weather have for you guys in the fourth quarter? Like will apparel be an issue if weather doesn't really get cold here and -- because it seems like it did -- it was softer for everybody, not just you in October because weather was a little more warmer than normal. So just wondering how to think about the fourth quarter in apparel. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Certainly, Q4 is the most weather-dependent category. We've, over time, mitigated some of the volatility of that factor because we can't control the weather, but just making sure we have all sorts of lightweight. Fleece is a big driver for us and things that don't depend on super extreme cold. That said, we like cold. So I'm hoping for a snowy Thanksgiving and Christmas. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. And then another question just -- I know inventory is in good shape, but how are you guys planning it to end -- get through the fourth quarter? And then your initial thoughts on '24, like how you'll plan? Will it be up? Will it still be down a little bit like we've been seeing this year? How should we think about it? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I would say that we haven't given the guidance for Q4 on inventory. But I would start to say by the fact that if you look at our sales were up 3% almost in Q3, and our inventory was down 2%. So that kind of indicates how well we are managing the overall inventory position, and I would say a similar sentiment as we look to Q4 as well.\n We are right now in the middle of our budget season for 2024, and we are planning through the top line, the bottom line expectations and the inventory. So we'll share more about exact 2024 working capital investment as we share the guidance in next quarter. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Will Gaertner at Wells Fargo. \nFrederick Gaertner: Could you guys just give us a breakdown of store openings for the balance of the year? And perhaps into next year, how you're thinking about store openings and how we should be modeling that? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. The store openings for Q4 are primarily done with the holiday season. So not too many stores are expected to open here in the fourth quarter.\n What we have guided in terms of the preliminary 2024 expectation is 10 House of Sport openings. You can see us continuing to open more Golf Galaxy locations into 2024. We continue to be really pleased with the overall performance of the Galaxy Performance Center. In addition, we will also be remodeling our stores to continue to keep our overall assortment within those stores fresh and have the right capability and experience investment in the core part of the DICK'S stores as well. \nFrederick Gaertner: Got it. And then maybe just talk a little bit about inventory in the channel. What are you seeing -- what categories are you seeing your heaviest? Which are lean? Just give us a little bit of context in what categories you're seeing from an inventory perspective? \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Well, there's nothing extraordinary or out of the ordinary going on with inventory in the categories or we're appropriately moving to product, the whole industry is, but it isn't the way it was last year where there was really distorted levels of inventory. \nOperator: We go next now to Joe Civello at Truist. \nJoseph Civello: Quick follow-up on the House of Sport locations. Can you guys call out anything in terms of like ticket or transaction benefits that you see at House of Sport versus other locations? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. I would say, first of all, our overall portfolio of the House of Sport is resonating really well with the athlete. So we see benefits in how many athletes and how far they're traveling to come and visit these experiential locations that we have. In addition, we are also seeing benefits in the overall basket size. So I'm really encouraged by the make of the athletes, the engagement that we are able to drive with those athletes as well as the basket size. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Justin Kleber at Baird. \nJustin Kleber: Just one for me on the implied 4Q revenue guide. If I take the midpoints of the comp and the noncomp benchmarks you shared, it looks like guidance assumes that revenues will lift sequentially kind of in the high teens range, if I exclude the extra week. And if I go back prepandemic, your 4Q revenues used to grow north of 30% quarter-over-quarter. So just -- can you help me, I guess, reconcile why that's not the case anymore? Why that relationship doesn't hold? Are you just more disciplined with promotions around the holiday? Or is the mix of the business that much different? Just trying to understand that. \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Justin, this is Navdeep. I'll take an attempt at that. The way we have thought about fourth quarter is very comparable to how we think about the holiday season. Holiday season is a very distinct and a different season when we compare that to the back-to-school season. So we look at it much more on a sequential year-over-year basis versus the 3Q to 4Q build. \n But to your point, when we look -- the fourth quarter expectation that we guided to, first of all, we are up against a 5.3% comp. It's a much more wider competitive set compared to the back-to-school season. And we continue to be really confident on the high end of the expectation that we have -- that we have driven about the things that we have within our control. We moderated the low end of our Q4 expectation, just considering the macroeconomic landscape that we'll be competing with everybody else in fourth quarter. So we feel we have appropriately balanced the outlook and maybe we can take that offline and if you have a deeper question on that. \nLauren Hobart: Yes. Justin, I would just add one thing that -- and again, we don't have the numbers compared to multiple years ago on this particular topic, but I would hypothesize that the strength that we've had in our business in Q3 between back-to-school categories, team sports over the years and just footwear and apparel is probably -- has even smoothed out that curve a little bit. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Daniel Imbro at Stephens. \nDaniel Imbro: Maybe a first one just on inventory and then the optimization actions. I guess the inventory write-down, Navdeep, is that all within the outdoor categories that were maybe left over from last quarter? And is there anything left to do on the inventory side? It does look like on the website, there's still some decent promotions in bikes and outdoors. So trying to think about are we through that inventory kind of write-down or optimization? \nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Daniel, let me clarify. The two things are totally separate and distinct. The onetime action that is included in our GAAP outlook and the inventory write-down actually is associated with the Moosejaw brand. We have some tertiary SKUs in that business. That will not be part of the go-forward assortment as we look to bring the 2 brands together. And so that's what you're seeing is the action around the Moosejaw business, not necessarily anything to do with the actions that we talked about in Q2. \n Overall, our inventory is really clean and we are really excited about the assortment that we have available for Q4. And if you look at the overall inventory, we were down 2% on top line growth of 3%. So we continue to manage the overall inventory really well and excited for the holiday season. \nDaniel Imbro: Great. And then maybe as a related follow-up, Lauren, you noted you're not seeing any trade down today, and that's maybe surprising, but encouraging. I'm curious how you're thinking about buying inventory or how you're telling your buyers today to handle that. Are you preparing for a further trade down? Are you building inventory in that part of the price spectrum? And maybe if not, if we see a trade down, could there be a mismatch between the inventory you built and where the consumer shakes out? \nLauren Hobart: Dan, it's a great question. We make sure that we have inventory for every single shopper at every single price point. So while some of our products have become even more premium as we've got access to premium footwear and just hotter products in general we, at the same time, have made meaningful inroads with our DSG brand, which is an opening price point brand that has tremendous value and tremendous fashion and a great price point. So I think we're perfectly suited to match the consumer needs, and we've been very happy to see that the consumer isn't shifting down, but we can flex and we'll have what they need when they need it. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn things back over to you, Ms. Hobart, President and CEO, for any closing comments. \nLauren Hobart: Well, thank you very much. I hope everybody has a wonderful Thanksgiving. Thanks for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and we'll see you in the New Year. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Hobart. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, that does conclude the Q3 2023 DICK'S Sporting Goods Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for joining us, and we wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which demonstrate the ongoing strength of our business and the focused execution of our team. We had a very strong back-to-school season, driven by our best-in-class athlete experience and differentiated assortment. And we continue to gain market share as consumers prioritize DICK'S Sporting Goods to meet their needs. \n Our third quarter sales increased 2.8% to $3.04 billion and our comps increased 1.7%, driven by increases in both transactions and average ticket. This strong comp was on top of a 6.5% increase from the same period last year. And during the quarter, we saw more athletes purchase from us while spending more each trip. \n On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 gross margin expanded by 88 basis points versus the prior year period. And looking to Q4, we expect to see continued year-over-year gross margin expansion. We achieved double-digit non-GAAP EBT margin of 10.6% and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.85, up 10% over Q3 last year. \n As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our full year outlook. Our updated guidance balances the confidence we have in our key strategies with an acknowledgment of the uncertain macroeconomic environment. For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $12 to $12.60 compared to our prior expectation of $11.50 to $12.30. In addition, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 2% compared to our prior expectation of flat to positive 2%. At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.4%. \n We have a tremendous long-term growth opportunity ahead of us, and are making strategic investments that position us well for growth and enable us to continue gaining share in a large, fragmented industry. These investments include accelerating innovation in our omnichannel athlete experience and expanding our new concepts like House of Sport and our new 50,000 square foot prototype which are resonating exceptionally well with our athletes. \n As we outlined on our last call, we've done extensive work to optimize our business so we can capture the opportunity ahead of us. This includes better aligning our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most significant growth opportunities while also streamlining our overall cost structure. \n First, as we discussed last quarter, we are resourcing DICK'S for growth and refocusing our team on our 4 key strategic pillars of differentiated products, athlete experience, teammate experience, and brand engagement. Second, we are optimizing our outdoor specialty business. This primarily includes integrating the operations of Moosejaw and Public Lands to enhance our ability to fulfill outdoor athlete demand more effectively. This new structure immediately improves operational efficiency and strategically positions this business for profitable growth within the $40 billion outdoor industry. Navdeep will share more details about our business optimization plans, including the expected SG&A benefits and the charges related to executing these plans. \n Innovating within the omnichannel athlete experience is at the heart of our growth strategies. Our newest DICK'S concepts have proven to be tremendously successful and are a key part of our future as we continue to reimagine our store portfolio and footprint. \n First, we continue to be pleased with the results from our DICK'S House of Sport locations. We opened 2 new Houses of Sport at the beginning of Q3 and now have a total of 12 locations open, 9 of which we opened this year. We're excited to open approximately 10 additional locations throughout 2024, including at the Prudential Center in Boston as well as locations in Pittsburgh, Miami and Tampa. We continue to expect that by 2027, we will have between 75 to 100 across the country. \n In addition to House of Sport, we're rolling out our next-generation DICK'S store, which revolutionizes our most typical 50,000 square foot format. During Q3, we're excited to have opened another 5 locations. And earlier this month, we opened 3 more. With a total of 11 next-generation locations now open, we are pleased with the performance and confident in the long-term opportunity of this new 50,000 square foot prototype. \n We're also growing our Golf Galaxy footprint through Golf Galaxy Performance Center, an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels. During Q3, we opened 7 new Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, expanding our Golf Galaxy chain to 104 locations, including 13 Performance Centers. We believe there is a significant long-term growth opportunity in golf. Over the next 4 years, we expect to have as many as 40 to 50 Golf Galaxy Performance Centers across the U.S., including approximately 10 new locations in 2024. \n In combination with our stores, our digital experience remains an integral part of our success and the investments we are making in technology are strengthening our athletes' omnichannel experience and driving increased engagement. This quarter, we added 1.6 million new athletes and are further growing our base of omnichannel athletes. Omnichannel athletes make up the majority of our sales, and they spend more and shop with us more frequently than single-channel athletes. As we invest in data science and personalization, we're excited to continue building one-to-one relationships and better serving these athletes. \n We remain focused on ensuring DICK'S is a convenient one-stop shop and have enhanced our multiple delivery and pickup options by expanding same-day delivery. In fact, athletes can now filter online for same-day delivery. And this holiday season, we will offer same-day delivery service up until 12 noon on Christmas Eve for last-minute gifting. \n In closing, we're very pleased with our strong third quarter results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. We're excited for the upcoming holiday season and the product, service and experience we're providing to our athletes. \n I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods and for their upcoming efforts during the fourth quarter. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Simeon. Yes, we are pleased with how our consumer is holding up within the sporting goods industry and then particularly that they're choosing DICK's increasingly to meet their needs. People are prioritizing a healthy and active lifestyle. They're prioritizing team sports, outdoors, living, running, walking, all of those things. And so we felt in this past quarter, particularly pleased of the increase in transactions and ticket. And the fact that our consumers are not trading down, that our consumer has held up very, very well.\n So as we look into Q4, as you've heard in our guidance, we are very excited about what we have within our control for Q4. Our products are in stock. We've got tremendous gifts. And if you look at LinkedIn, I know you follow DSG -- #dsglife, but you'll see what we call Reindeer Runs going on all across the country, and the teams are pumped to deliver an amazing holiday experience. \n We're balancing all of that with caution about the macroeconomic environment and the consumer because we know that consumers are going through a lot right now. So I think we've been reasonably cautious in our guidance, but we're very excited about how our consumers are holding this up. Thanks, Simeon. I think it's important when you look at the gross margin to understand that our product mix has become increasingly differentiated. And as a result of that, one of our core operating philosophies is always to be very decisive and move inventory so that we can make room for clean and fresh receipts. And that is really what -- that's what drove our comp this past quarter and what's been driving our comp for some time. \n Last year, what you're mentioning, there were a few unusual events. There was a lump in outdoor equipment related to the pandemic. There was a lump in like apparel related to the pandemic. That is not the story of this quarter. This quarter, we are very happy with the inventory that we're bringing in. And we move decisively to move the product that's in the stores through to clearance and to outdoor into online channels that we could make room to have an amazing Q4 and amazing holiday season. \n I do think that's what drove our comps. And I would remind you that we are still -- you take out the impact of shrink, we are still 50% higher on a merch margin basis from where we were before. So we're very proud of where we are from a gross margin standpoint and expect it to continue to improve. Thanks, Robby. I'll start, and I'll turn it over to Navdeep. House of Sport stores are performing very, very well. And I think it's important to note that as much as we got a positive impact from those stores, both the first 3 that we opened more than a year ago and the new stores that just opened in the past 6 months, we also had growth across the balance of our portfolio and our omnichannel business as well. So it was a very balanced portfolio, which we're very happy with from a comp standpoint.\n The economics of House of Sport are very good. I'll turn it over to Navdeep to talk about how our lease rates and such. We're probably not going to get into that. But we have a very high standard for how we look at our real estate investments, and we don't do anything unless we hurdle a certain amount of ROI. So Navdeep, anything you would add? Thanks, Kate. Yes, the story in Q3 from a category level really was about the strength of our back-to-school business. We saw strength as back-to-school has different cycles throughout the country, early, mid and late back-to-school, and we could literally see the comps follow those trends. The back-to-school categories were performing so well. So collectively, that is footwear and apparel and hydration, which is doing incredibly well and then other accessories like backpacks, socks and those sorts of things. So we're very pleased with -- overall, how our key categories performed in Q3. \n Looking at the higher ticket, the COVID categories, I want to just remind you, they are a smaller percentage of our business. And across the board, they remain significantly higher than our pre-COVID levels. We do expect long-term growth in those categories. We're just managing through them. But they are a small percentage of our business relative to the rest. Yes, sure. I think House of Sport is unique in that it is totally rooted in sport, and it's a fantastic destination for all of our brands. So if you look at some of our bigger brand partners, it's one of the best presentations -- they've said, one of the best presentations of their brands that they see. It's also an opportunity because of the size and the level of service where we can bring in new and emerging brands. And through that channel, we brought in brands like FP Movement and On and HOKA. And so -- and those then have ability to transfer down to the rest of the chain as we become partners. \n So our vertical brands also have incredible presence in our House of Sport stores. We lead with them across the board in many of our entrances and they're doing quite well, too. So overall, just -- it's a fantastic presentation and really puts brands in their best light. Us, too. Yes. Warren, we are being conservative on the low end of our guidance just given -- Navdeep just said, first of all, we compete with everyone in the world during the fourth quarter. And also, the consumer is going through an awful lot and we're just going -- we're trying to be cautious. And so I wouldn't read into anything other than we are trying to model in an appropriate level of caution due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Yes, Chris, so in terms of the strength of our quarter, the calendarization of our quarter, you are correct. The back-to-school strength drove significant comps in August and September. We did see a moderation in October of comps, but we also had unfavorable weather, as warmer weather has an impact. So nothing significant. But yes, we saw a moderation in October. \n As we look to the holiday season, obviously, we have the biggest weeks coming up ahead of us, and it will be busy right until December 25. And we are seeing holidays kicking off, and this has been going on now for a few years. Earlier, in November, we've been talking about that for some time. We're seeing it now, and we expect it will be a key 5 or 6 weeks here, and it will be similar timing to what it was before, with events driving a lot of the excitement. We're excited. Generally speaking, we're excited about the innovation in our business. We're excited about the new formats that we're innovating. We're excited about innovation in our service model. And we're excited about the product that we're seeing from many of our brand partners. We think it's going to be very -- it will be a great year from -- without me giving guidance, I'm excited about the product that I'm seeing 2024. \n Innovation across the board, categories get interestingly hot from time to time. It's interesting to see what's happening with hydration in the past few years. There could be other categories that pop next year, but we see really exciting product in all the key categories of apparel and footwear and golf. Michael, yes, we are -- I would say, one of our core operating philosophies and what is driving our top line sales is our ability to keep our inventory fresh and clean. And especially the more that the inventory has become highly differentiated, it's important to bring it in when it's hot, when it's -- and keep the stores constantly evolving. \n And so we are -- as our gross margin materialized through the quarter, we were slightly more aggressive in terms of moving stuff out, but the environment was slightly more promotional than we had originally expected. But generally speaking, we were decisive just to keep the stores clean. Nothing extraordinary or out of the ordinary, I should say, happened during the quarter. And we're very pleased that we were able to grow gross margin. And as we look to Q4, we are expecting accelerated gains. We're also very pleased with the overall profitability of the business. Yes. Actually, the Q4 gross margin acceleration also factors in the fact that Q4 was a very promotional clearance time as the industry had a glut of apparel last year at this time. And so when we're saying we are looking to Q4, we are seeing some increased promotional activity, we're seeing more [ map breaks ] and we will be participating surgically where and when we feel it's necessary for us to stay competitive. We have factored all of that into our guidance and still expect gross margin to accelerate in Q4. Yes. In Q4, as I mentioned, we compete with everything from jewelry to appliances to everything that could possibly be a gift. And so the promotions by category are what you would expect. There is -- I wouldn't say there's an area of the store that's more promotional. We're making sure we have hot deals for consumers who are coming in and excited to shop during the holiday season. \n Vendor support, we work ongoing with our vendors. This is a week in, week out, month in, month out. And that -- it's something we're not going to comment on specifically, but continues to be a key part of our operating model. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Certainly, Q4 is the most weather-dependent category. We've, over time, mitigated some of the volatility of that factor because we can't control the weather, but just making sure we have all sorts of lightweight. Fleece is a big driver for us and things that don't depend on super extreme cold. That said, we like cold. So I'm hoping for a snowy Thanksgiving and Christmas. Yes. Well, there's nothing extraordinary or out of the ordinary going on with inventory in the categories or we're appropriately moving to product, the whole industry is, but it isn't the way it was last year where there was really distorted levels of inventory. Yes. Justin, I would just add one thing that -- and again, we don't have the numbers compared to multiple years ago on this particular topic, but I would hypothesize that the strength that we've had in our business in Q3 between back-to-school categories, team sports over the years and just footwear and apparel is probably -- has even smoothed out that curve a little bit. Dan, it's a great question. We make sure that we have inventory for every single shopper at every single price point. So while some of our products have become even more premium as we've got access to premium footwear and just hotter products in general we, at the same time, have made meaningful inroads with our DSG brand, which is an opening price point brand that has tremendous value and tremendous fashion and a great price point. So I think we're perfectly suited to match the consumer needs, and we've been very happy to see that the consumer isn't shifting down, but we can flex and we'll have what they need when they need it. Well, thank you very much. I hope everybody has a wonderful Thanksgiving. Thanks for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods, and we'll see you in the New Year. Thank you."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results. We are very pleased to report consolidated sales increase 2.8% to $3.04 billion as we continued to gain market share. Comp store sales increased 1.7% on top of a 6.5% increase in the same period last year. Our strong comps were driven by a 1.1% increase in transactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket. Collectively, our back-to-school categories did very well and we're pleased with the results from our House of Sport locations. Our noncomp sales growth of roughly 110 basis points this quarter was primarily driven by sales at Moosejaw. \n On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit in the third quarter was $1.07 billion or 35.1% of net sales and improved 88 basis points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by lower supply chain costs, which leveraged 78 basis points. Merchandise margin increased 23 basis points and as expected, this increase was primarily driven by anniversary of our clearance activity from last year and partially offset by higher shrink of approximately 50 basis points. To be clear, absent the shrink headwind, our merchandise margin would have increased over 70 basis points. [ Combating theft ] remains a top priority, and we continue to invest in efforts to keep our stores, teammates and athletes safe. \n On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expense increased $50.1 million to $729.9 million and deleveraged 102 basis points compared to last year. This was favorable versus our expectation due to better-than-expected sales, targeted actions to control discretionary costs and benefits from our business optimization actions. \n As we have highlighted on prior calls, the year-over-year deleverage this quarter was driven by our investments in our base rate, talent and technology to create a better athlete experience as well as investments in marketing. These areas of investments were partially offset by $8.2 million of expense reduction or 26 basis points of leverage associated with changes in the investment value of our deferred compensation plan, which is fully offset in other income. \n Interest expense was $14.4 million, a decrease of $11.7 million compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to the inducement charges incurred in the prior year related to the exchange of our convertible senior notes and the interest savings this year from the retirement of those notes. \n Other income totaled $10.1 million compared to $4.8 million in the same period last year. This $5.3 million increase in income was driven by a $13.3 million increase in interest income as a result of higher average interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents. This increase to other income was partially offset by $8.2 million expense increase from change in the value of our deferred compensation plans, which fully offsets the SG&A expense reduction I mentioned earlier. \n Driven by our strong sales, higher gross margin, along with lower interest expense, non-GAAP EBT was $321.1 million or 10.6% of net sales. This compares to an EBT of $304.2 million or 10.3% of net sales in 2022. In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.60 last year, an increase of 10%. \n As Lauren said, to continue fueling our long-term growth, we have optimized our organization to better align our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most critical strategies while also streamlining our overall cost structure. \n First, we are resourcing DICK'S for growth. As we have discussed -- as we discussed on our last call, during the third quarter, we took actions to change our resourcing and organizational structure, primarily at our customer support center. \n Second, we are taking steps to optimize our outdoor specialty business and are forming one team that will support the operations of Public Lands and Moosejaw. This will allow us to quickly leverage the best practices across our outdoor specialty business to drive growth while operating more efficiently. \n We started to see the SG&A benefits from these actions during the third quarter and expect to see continued benefits into Q4 and 2024. These actions, along with our overall focus on improving productivity and reducing discretionary costs will help enable us to significantly moderate our SG&A expense growth in 2024 as compared to this year. \n As a result of these actions, we incurred pretax charges totaling $52.5 million during the third quarter. This included a $6.3 million of inventory-related write-down associated with rationalization of non-go-forward Moosejaw inventory. These charges were included in our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.39. For additional details on this, you can refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release that we issued this morning. \n Now looking to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 2% compared to Q3 of last year. Our inventory is well positioned, and we are excited about our assortment for the holiday season. \n Turning to our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $151 million and we paid $81 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $388.1 million at an average price of $112.46. Year-to-date, we have returned over $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \n Let me wrap up with our outlook for 2023. As Laura noted, as a result of our Q3 performance, we are raising our full year outlook. We are confident in our key strategies and are well positioned to execute against what is in our control. At the same time, we are being appropriately cautious, particularly at the low end of our expectations, considering the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. \n For the year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $12 to $12.60 compared to our prior expectation of $11.50 to $12.30. This continues to include approximately $0.20 coming from the 53rd week. In addition, we now expect comparable store sales in the range of positive 0.5% to positive 2% compared to our prior expectation of flat to positive 2%. Including the 53rd week, we expect roughly 250 basis points of noncomp sales growth for the full year. Specifically, this includes approximately $150 million in sales from the 53rd week, which is a smaller than average sales week for us. \n At the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 10.4% compared to our prior expectation of 10.2%. We expect modest improvement in gross margin for the full year, which continues to include an approximate 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher shrink compared to 2022. \n Specific to Q4, we expect to deliver continued gross margin and merch margin expansion on a year-over-year basis with some improvement versus our Q3 expansion. We also continue to expect SG&A expenses to deleverage on a full year, primarily due to the proactive investments in our growth strategies. Specific to Q4, we expect SG&A to deleverage by a similar magnitude as the third quarter. \n Our earnings guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 21% and an approximately 86 million average diluted shares outstanding compared to our prior expectation of approximately 87 million average diluted shares outstanding. In addition, we expect net capital expenditures between $550 million to $600 million for the year. As part of our business optimization, we incurred pretax charges totaling $52.5 million during the third quarter and currently expect to incur charges of approximately $10 million in fourth quarter. These charges were excluded from today's non-GAAP outlook. We are still conducting our business optimization review, which we expect to be completed during fiscal 2023. \n This concludes our prepared comments. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yes. Robby, thanks for your comments. And as far as the House of Sport is concerned, like we have talked about -- we continue to be, first of all, pleased with the performance of the 12 stores that we have opened. And the benefit is not just coming from an economic point of view, which is also great, but we are also seeing our ability to be able to attract new brands and new partners that are coming to showcase their product at House of Sport location. And we feel Prudential Center will be another kind of that top-notch location where the brands would love to showcase their product. We'll share more details about the economics of these boxes when we share our 2024 expectations because we -- our plan is to open 10 additional locations in '24. \n Coming to your question about Going, Going, Gone!, the Going, Going, Gone! chain and the warehouse plus locations, as we call them, continue to play a very important role in our overall clearance strategy. Like Lauren talked about, the core differentiator for us continues to be the product assortment that we have available to drive the engaged relationship with our athletes. We are seeing our assortment resonate really well with the athletes. And having fresh and new vibrant assortment available in stores is a key part of that strategy. And Going, Going, Gone! allows us to move any excess or clearance inventory very efficiently into those locations and get a much better economic return than we were able to get in the past. \n In terms of the noncomp impact, it didn't have a significant noncomp impact because the number of stores that we had in Q3 this year are very comparable to the number of stores that we had last year. So 58 stores this year compared to, call it, 56 stores last year in Q3. So it's a very comparable view. The noncomp benefit in the Q3 of this year was driven by the Moosejaw business. Yes. We expect similar store count to be because we feel like we have reached a good point of where we can operate those number of stores very efficiently. The noncomp in fourth quarter will be Moosejaw as well as the 53rd week, as we have called out. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the Q3 performance that we saw in the SG&A. So the SG&A came in -- from a rate perspective, it's still deleveraged, 100 basis points, but it was lower than the expectation that we had given at the end of Q2, driven by three primary things. \n First, the top line came in at the higher end of our expectations. So we're very pleased with the productivity that we were able to drive from just the leverage on the higher level of top line performance. \n Second, really, really focused about the work that got done within the collective organization to be able to drive productivity and efficiency pretty much in the discretionary areas, away from the core strategies of the company. So you saw the results of that manifest through the P&L that we delivered. And then some of the actions that we undertook here in the business optimization, the early parts of those benefits were also in Q3. And we expect a similar outlook as we shared for Q4. We expect SG&A to deleverage in the similar zone as where the deleverage in Q3 came in. \n In terms of 2024, here's the way I'll say it because we are not ready to provide guidance as yet for 2024, but here's a framework to think about it. The business optimization actions that we have taken, particularly in the Moosejaw and Public Lands businesses being brought together, that benefit will continue into 2024. And that's the reason we said our SG&A will significantly moderate in terms of the growth as we go into '24. \n In addition, the work that we are doing currently and have done in the discretionary cost area in Q3 and in Q4, we expect that benefit also to continue into 2024. So we'll share more at the next earnings call about '24 expectations, including the top line and the SG&A and the profitability expectation. I would say what we are really pleased is the fact that our consumer is holding up really well. We are seeing growth both in our transaction and in our ticket. And as Lauren indicated, we have not seen any trade downs, and all income demographics across our portfolio actually grew. \n However, the competitive set in holidays is different than back-to-school season. So we are very optimistic about the things that are within our control, our assortment, our service levels as well as the experience in the stores are ready to serve our athletes. And we couldn't be more excited about the holiday season. Us, too. Yes. Warren, I'll stay away from 2024 guidance. We'll provide that at the next quarter. But I'll -- maybe I'll answer your first part of the question. In terms of the freight expenses, I would say that the freight expenses, to your point, did start to moderate in terms of the growth last year. It's also -- we started to see the benefits of the lower freight expenses in the back half of last year. And I would say they were a little bit more pronounced into Q4. So if you look at our prepared comments from last year, you will be able to get to a good approximation for the Q4 expectations. \n And about the occupancy, we'll talk about more between House of Sport and Galaxy because that all ties into how we think about the overall operating model. But like Lauren said, the core growth opportunities that we see between the House of Sport locations, the next-gen 50k as well as Golf Galaxy, we are very excited about all of those opportunities, and we'll share more at the next quarter meeting. And maybe I'll add one more point. We still see organic opportunity for us to continue to expand our premium full service footwear decks into the larger part of the overall company portfolio of stores. And as we do that, that opens up more access to brands as well as deeper access within those brands as well. So there are organic actions that we have at our disposal and quite frankly, that have done really well that give us confidence as we look to '24. Yes, about 75% of the stores today have that capability. Michael, let me add one more thing. I'll just clarify on the last part of the question. As -- in my prepared comments, I talked about that we expect both the gross profit as well as the merch margin to expand as we go into the fourth quarter. So the merch margin would be on -- like the things that Lauren talked about, would be kind of the annualization of the actions and the capabilities that we have. And to your last part of the question, that lower freight cost benefits would be part of the gross profit. Yes. Paul, consistent with what we have said, the capital allocation priority continues to remain consistent. We are focused on maintaining an appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet. And the second is to continue to maintain our investment-grade status that we have. And the third priority continues to be invest into the business. And as part of our updated guidance, we have maintained the capital investment expectation of $550 million to $600 million. \n What you saw us do in Q3 is when we see there is an opportunistic or a dislocation in our stock price, we will step in based on where the stock prices and the long-term confidence we have in our company. And we stepped in and bought $388 million worth of stock. And from a return to the shareholders, our priority continues to be able to give a good return in terms of the dividend, which we doubled this year as well as continuing to opportunistically buy back shares. Yes. [ Kelly ], thanks for that question. Let me clarify one thing. We never took out those stores that were converted into House of Sport out of the comp base. So they were part of our comp base even in the first half of this year. And quite frankly, we had talked about that they were an unfavorable impact as we were converting them.\n In terms of the performance that we have seen from these stores, we couldn't be more excited. There are only eight of them that -- collectively 12 of them, but the original stores are doing really well. The new group of stores are doing extremely well as well. And yes, they had a favorable impact to our comp, but we were very pleased with the overall portfolio of the brick-and-mortar and the omni comp that we were able to deliver. So overall, very pleased with the performance of House of Sport location as well as the core business that we saw in Q3. Yes. This is -- let me start on that. First, let's talk a little bit about our overall excitement about the outdoor category. Like we have talked about Moosejaw and Public Lands collectively serve the outdoor athlete, and that industry is a $40 billion highly fragmented industry, but not a clear leader. So as we see the collective capability that we have between the Moosejaw brand as well as the Public Lands brand, we are extremely excited about that opportunity to continue to differentiate and provide a much more synergistic way of serving that athlete as we look forward.\n So what we talked about in Q3 was we were -- as you can imagine, after the acquisition, we are integrating the back-office operations of the Moosejaw and Public Lands team and bringing one team together to serve these athletes. \n In terms of the number of Public Lands stores that we have, we have 7 Public Lands locations right now, and we are excited about the ongoing business that we see here collectively between both these brands. We'll share more details in 2024. But yes, our plans are to continue testing and learning into this brand and opening more stores as we go look into the future. John, I would say, first of all, as we have talked about, most of the 12 stores that we have opened are either a conversion or a relocation of an existing store. So what you're looking here is not a significant expansion in the square footage of the overall company. But what we are seeing is a very differentiated experience that we are able to provide in these stores.\n We'll share more specifics in fourth quarter, but I can give you this that from a sales productivity perspective as well as the contribution perspective, we are very happy with the financial returns that we are delivering on these investments. So in our prepared comments, what we shared was that we expect our SG&A growth to significantly moderate, especially considering the growth that we have seen in our SG&A this year. But as you can imagine, it's a combination of multiple things. What do we expect the sales growth to be next year. \n But -- so we'll share more, but the framework that I would use is, first of all, the business optimization work that we are doing, especially with bringing the Moosejaw and the Public Lands business together will have continued benefit, actually bigger benefits into 2024, as well as the productivity and the efficiency conversation that we talked about in Q3 and Q4, those actions will continue to kind of help us mitigate the growth in SG&A as we look to the future. Yes. I would say that we haven't given the guidance for Q4 on inventory. But I would start to say by the fact that if you look at our sales were up 3% almost in Q3, and our inventory was down 2%. So that kind of indicates how well we are managing the overall inventory position, and I would say a similar sentiment as we look to Q4 as well.\n We are right now in the middle of our budget season for 2024, and we are planning through the top line, the bottom line expectations and the inventory. So we'll share more about exact 2024 working capital investment as we share the guidance in next quarter. Yes. The store openings for Q4 are primarily done with the holiday season. So not too many stores are expected to open here in the fourth quarter.\n What we have guided in terms of the preliminary 2024 expectation is 10 House of Sport openings. You can see us continuing to open more Golf Galaxy locations into 2024. We continue to be really pleased with the overall performance of the Galaxy Performance Center. In addition, we will also be remodeling our stores to continue to keep our overall assortment within those stores fresh and have the right capability and experience investment in the core part of the DICK'S stores as well. Yes. I would say, first of all, our overall portfolio of the House of Sport is resonating really well with the athlete. So we see benefits in how many athletes and how far they're traveling to come and visit these experiential locations that we have. In addition, we are also seeing benefits in the overall basket size. So I'm really encouraged by the make of the athletes, the engagement that we are able to drive with those athletes as well as the basket size. Yes. Justin, this is Navdeep. I'll take an attempt at that. The way we have thought about fourth quarter is very comparable to how we think about the holiday season. Holiday season is a very distinct and a different season when we compare that to the back-to-school season. So we look at it much more on a sequential year-over-year basis versus the 3Q to 4Q build. \n But to your point, when we look -- the fourth quarter expectation that we guided to, first of all, we are up against a 5.3% comp. It's a much more wider competitive set compared to the back-to-school season. And we continue to be really confident on the high end of the expectation that we have -- that we have driven about the things that we have within our control. We moderated the low end of our Q4 expectation, just considering the macroeconomic landscape that we'll be competing with everybody else in fourth quarter. So we feel we have appropriately balanced the outlook and maybe we can take that offline and if you have a deeper question on that. Yes, Daniel, let me clarify. The two things are totally separate and distinct. The onetime action that is included in our GAAP outlook and the inventory write-down actually is associated with the Moosejaw brand. We have some tertiary SKUs in that business. That will not be part of the go-forward assortment as we look to bring the 2 brands together. And so that's what you're seeing is the action around the Moosejaw business, not necessarily anything to do with the actions that we talked about in Q2. \n Overall, our inventory is really clean and we are really excited about the assortment that we have available for Q4. And if you look at the overall inventory, we were down 2% on top line growth of 3%. So we continue to manage the overall inventory really well and excited for the holiday season."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Lauren.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered another strong quarter. We are very proud of our Q3 results and our performance year to date. These results show how well our long-term strategies are working and the great execution from our team. Our Q3 comps increased 4.2%, driven by our four strategic pillars: omnichannel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, deep engagement with the DICK'S brand, and our knowledgeable and passionate teammates who are integral to our success. We had an excellent back-to-school season and continue to gain market share. Our third-quarter gross margin expanded 67 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results, driven by higher merchandise margin. And we delivered EPS of $2.75. As a result of our strong performance in the quarter, and the continued confidence we have in our business, we are again raising our full-year outlook. We now expect comp sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.6% to 4.2%, and EPS to be in the range of $13.65 to $13.95. At the heart of our long-term strategy is the omnichannel athlete. We are continuing to invest across our digital and store experiences with a focus on elevating training, service, and product knowledge to drive enhanced engagement with our athletes. We feel great about the strong performance of health of sport and strong engagement with our athletes. We are redefining sports retail and creating brand partners and communities. We continue to see sport having a strong influence on culture and culture on sport. And our health of sport concept is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of all athletes across both performance and lifestyle. In Q3, we opened three House of Sport locations, followed by two more earlier this month, bringing us to nineteen now open ahead of the holiday season. In 2025, we expect to open approximately six Health and Support locations, and we remain on track to have seventy-five to a hundred locations open by 2027. Inspired by health of sport, we continue to revolutionize our fifty thousand square foot DICK'S stores with a next-generation format which we refer to internally as our Fieldhouse concept. These stores continue to do very well in both sales and profitability. In Q3, we opened five Fieldhouse locations, followed by another four earlier this month, bringing us to twenty-six now open. In 2025, we expect to open approximately twenty Fieldhouse locations. The Texas market is an exciting growth opportunity for us, and one of the areas where we are investing in new health support locations in marketing, in our infrastructure to enhance the omnichannel experience for our athletes and capture this potential. This quarter, we broke ground on the new distribution center we've been planning in Fort Worth, Texas, which is expected to open in early 2026. Our digital capabilities are central to our omnichannel athlete experience. We continue to improve the shopping experience for our athletes, including on DICKS.com and our DICK'S mobile app. Our elevated and diverse assortment uniquely positions us as the destination for new products. And this past quarter, we expanded our product launch reservations in our DICK'S app beyond footwear to include product drops across other key categories. We're also giving our teammates new and improved technology tools to help them find the right product quicker, including expanding our use of RFID technology. As we discussed, Game Changer continues to be a key part of our digital strategy and is strengthening our leadership in the multibillion-dollar youth sports tech ecosystem. Over 5.5 million unique users were active on Game Changer in the third quarter, a 21% increase from last year. And we had approximately two million average daily active users in the Game Changer app during the quarter. Providing differentiated on-trend products helps make DICK'S the go-to destination for sport in the US. Our health of sport and Fieldhouse concepts have opened doors to new brand partnerships and strengthened existing relationships as they enable us to showcase our brand partners and vertical brands in a way no one else can. Our priority categories continue to perform very well, led by important national brands and our flagship vertical brands. And we have deliberately taken steps to be fully stocked across key products and categories for holiday shopping. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the product pipeline into next year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong third-quarter results and are highly confident in our long-term strategies to drive sustained sales and profit growth. We believe our differentiated product quality, service, and powerful omnichannel experience will resonate well with our athletes this holiday season, along with this year's really fun holiday campaign featuring NFL legend JJ Watt and his family. It's just driving so much buzz. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods and their focus on delivering great experiences for our athletes this holiday season. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with some highlights of our strong year-to-date performance. Through the third quarter, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% to $9.55 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 4.7%, driven by a 3.7% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in transactions. EBT was $1.12 billion, or 11.75% of net sales. This is up from non-GAAP EBT of $975.3 million, or 10.71% of net sales in the same thirty-nine-week period last year. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $10.43. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $9.08 last year, an increase of 15% for the thirty-nine-week period. Now moving to our Q3 results. Adjusting for the calendar shift, which we believe provides the clearest view of the business, our Q3 comps increased 4.2% as we continue to gain market share. Our strong comps were driven by a 4.8% increase in average ticket and partially offset by a modest 0.6% decline in transactions. Our back-to-school categories did very well, with strength across footwear, athletic apparel, and team sports. Consolidated net sales increased 0.5% to $3.06 billion. As we previewed during the last quarter's call, this included the unfavorable impact of the calendar shift from the fifty-third week last year. As expected, this shifted a key back-to-school week out of Q3 and into Q2, unfavorably impacting third-quarter sales by approximately $105 million and $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Gross profit for the third quarter remains strong at $1.09 billion, or 35.77% of net sales, and increased 67 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin of 84 basis points due to favorable sales mix and the quality of our assortment. This was partially offset by expected deleverage on occupancy costs driven by the unfavorable impact to our total sales from the calendar shift. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 7.2% to $787.1 million and deleveraged 162 basis points compared to last year's non-GAAP results. This year-over-year deleverage was expected, with approximately 65 basis points of this increase due to the unfavorable impact to our reported total sales from the calendar shift. The remaining increase was driven by strategic investments primarily across marketing, technology, and talent based on the strength of our business as well as higher incentive compensation. Reopening expenses were $16.8 million, a decrease of $3.6 million compared to the prior year and favorable to both our expectations due to differences in timing of new store openings. EBT was $297.1 million, or 9.7% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $341.1 million, or 10.6% of net sales in Q3 of 2023. This included an unfavorable impact from the calendar shift of approximately 95 basis points. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $2.75. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85 last year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year included an unfavorable impact from the calendar shift of $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Now looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 13% compared to Q3 of last year. As we have talked about previously, to maximize the benefit of our differentiated assortment, we have made a conscious decision to lean into key items and categories which we expect to drive our growth in Q4 as well as into early 2025. Our investment is in some of our strongest product offerings, and we believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned as we enter the post-quarter. In fact, our clearance inventory is down meaningfully. Turning to our third-quarter capital allocation, net capital expenditures were approximately $185 million, and we paid $90 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased approximately 35,000 shares of our stock for $6.7 million at an average price of $194.22. Thus far this year, we have repurchased a total of $170.3 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $300 million. Now moving to our outlook for 2024. As Lauren said, we are again raising our full-year outlook. This reflects our strong Q3 performance and our confidence in our strategic initiatives and operational strength balanced against the dynamic macroeconomic environment and shorter traditional holiday shopping season. We now expect consolidated net sales in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion, compared to our prior expectation of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. We don't expect full-year comp sales growth in the range of 3.6% to 4.2%, compared to our prior expectation of 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Driven by the quality of assortment, we continue to expect gross margin to expand year over year and now anticipate it will slightly exceed our prior expectations. Based on the strength of our business, we are making strategic investments to better position ourselves for 2025 and over the long term, and continue to expect SG&A to deleverage year over year. We continue to expect EBT margins to be at 11.2% of sales at the midpoint. In total, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.65 to $13.95, compared to our prior expectation of $13.55 to $13.90. Our own guidance is based on approximately 82 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 23%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, keep in mind due to the impact of the shifted calendar, our reported total sales and EPS benefited by approximately $35 million or approximately $0.10 per diluted share through the first three quarters of the year. We expect a modestly unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter of approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share. On a full-year basis, this shift will not impact our results. Furthermore, recall that last year's fifty-third week added $170 million or $0.19 per diluted share in Q4 2023. In total, Q4 compares versus last year will be unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million in sales and approximately $0.29 in earnings per diluted share. This all has been contemplated within our updated guidance. In closing, we are very pleased with our third-quarter performance and the success of our long-term strategy. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Yih: Good morning. And let me just say congratulations. My first question is actually going to be on your ability to succeed in the current environment. So what we've seen so far during retail earnings season is most of the winners are those who are more value-oriented, and they're giving back price. The composition of your comp is kind of the opposite. It's, you know, stronger full-price selling, AUR probably up, on that ATV. So, Lauren, can you talk about why DICK'S is positioned, why you're taking so much market share with non-promotional sales, in an era of very promotional holiday? And the kind of shift of the power of your multi-brand retail strategy given that you're one of the biggest national sporting goods? Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. Yeah. We are really pleased with the comp that we just put up. And to your point, we have had three quarters in a row now of over a 4% comp. And I think it really is a testament to the fact that our long-term strategies are working. And I would point to the access that we've had continued to gain to differentiated product. Our merchant team has done an absolutely amazing job in your point, a multibrand retail strategy between our national partners and our vertical brands. And at the same time, our team throughout the entire organization is executing at such an incredibly high level. So we're really able to serve athletes with the products that they need and do it in a way that is increasingly engaging and a really fun experience. It's important, I think, to look at our athlete and how athletes are doing. They have been for some time prioritizing healthy and active lifestyle. They're prioritizing team sports. We saw a tremendous gain in the back-to-school categories this past quarter. So footwear, apparel, team sports, but also prioritizing just outdoor living, golf, really all of the athletic categories and just being outside. We saw 1.5 million more athletes enter our ecosystem over the past quarter, and we saw growth across all income demographics. So, again, to your point, we are sort of seeing different trends perhaps in the industry would be saying. Would point to the fact that we're in such an exciting time in sport and an exciting time in the industry. The country is really having what we're calling a sport moment. And if you think about it, between women's basketball, which is just on fire, and the expanded NCAA playoffs for football this year, and then the fact that the World Cup is going to be mostly in the US in 2026 and the Olympics in LA in 2028, we really expect that sport is going to continue to have an outsized influence on culture. And culture on sport. And I really think DICK'S is in such a great lane to just ride those trends in that we are rooted in. We are all the performance merchandising gear you could ever want, but we increasingly also have product that is the lifestyle of sport. And so, that's why we have such confidence in our athlete and our growth going forward.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. And my follow-up, Navdeep, I guess, officially, the tariff man has come. So we had an update yesterday evening. Twenty-five percent Canada, Mexico, and obviously the ten in China. Historically, you've already told us that you don't have much exposure, but for the private label. So can you just update us? I'm assuming that this doesn't change the answer that you've given us before. But just remind us, now that we have some quasi-official number, how you're thinking about that. Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Adrienne, thanks for that question. First of all, thank you for your comments on the Q3 results as well. We couldn't be more excited about the results that we have delivered here in Q3. In terms of tariffs, I think so I would say that's that a slightly more information is known. We still don't know about the timing and the likely the categories that would be impacted. So still a lot to be learned more. But like you said, you know, we have navigated this situation back in 2018, 2019, effectively as well. Vertical brands perspective, we have a very small actually very, very negligible amount of exposure because we have diversified our supply chain both from China as well as there's not much of an exposure even if you look into we feel we are well positioned for that. And then like Lauren indicated, we have very strong partnership with our national brand vendors. So as more is learned, we'll continue to navigate that in close partnership with our national brand vendors as well. Overall, if you look back to how we navigated this in 2018, 2019, that'll be kind of the playbook that will follow here again, as more is known.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Black Friday.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. My first question is on inventory and then a follow-up on the P&L. You gave the color around the inventory spread, and you mentioned similar factors in the prior quarter. So we know what to expect. My question is, are you tracking where you'd expect to be by the end of the fourth quarter? And does any of the slower start to cold temperatures affect how you'll end the year versus where you expect to be in the early part of next year?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. And, yes, I'm glad you asked. I want to discuss the inventory investment that we've made in inventory. We have made a conscious decision over the course of several quarters now to invest in our highly differentiated assortment. And this quarter, the inventory that we ended the quarter with is complete with things like key items, key brands, things like fleece, things like footwear, the licensed opportunity that I just mentioned with the NCAA playoff expansion. And so we don't peanut butter spread the inventory across the categories. We're very surgical and strategic about it. We have two exciting opportunities that some of this inventory is meant to address going into Q4. One of which is that around the holiday season leading into, like, the last days of Christmas or right before Christmas, we sometimes were broken on size and color for some of our key items, say Nike fleece and things like that. So we will be addressing that with the inventory. We also feel like we have an opportunity in our warmer weather climates to transition out of holiday and into our spring merchandise even earlier. So we've accelerated some of that. So these many of these products will have life into 2025, and we should see the results in the back half of the quarter and into 2025. So we are very confident. You saw it. We just increased our guidance. Our comp guidance implied in Q4 has increased as well, so we're very pleased.\nNavdeep Gupta: And, Simeon, let me just build on what Lauren said. The inventory is right in line with our expectation, and you called out a little bit on the colder weather impact. I would say, you know, the weather is still very early part of Q4. Vast majority of the holiday selling season is ahead of us. So we feel really good about the quality of the inventory. We also called out that the clearance levels continue to be really well managed. It's actually down significantly. So overall, really excited about the composition of the inventory, how well that inventory is positioned in the key categories. And based on that confidence, we raised our Q4 expectation on our full-year comp expectations as well.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks for that. The follow-up is on the P&L. I don't think we've gotten into a discussion on margin versus EBIT dollar growth? I know we've talked about it individual years. My question is, whether it's fourth quarter or beyond. Thinking about SG&A dollar growth because there's a higher level of expenses now with House of Sport, and other costs. Should we expect you to lever SG&A or should we meaning, should margins go up or should margins, you know, gross margin offset what's happening in SG&A? You know, how do we expect the movement of the P&L going forward?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Simeon, maybe I'll start with the full-year guidance that we have issued. And, you know, in another quarter, we'll be providing a little bit of a further outlook for 2025. So let's start with the results that we have posted as well as the guidance that we have issued. So first of all, we couldn't be more excited about the 4.7% comp that we have posted year to date and the guidance that we have issued. And at the midpoint of our guidance, our comp will be approximately 4%, which is on top of a 2.6% growth account growth last year. And like you indicated, our expectation is that the merch margin at the midpoint will expand on a forty basis points on a year-over-year basis as well. So said in effect that the way we are thinking about our focus in driving the business is to continue to drive the strong top line and strong bottom line improvement. There will be puts and takes between the margin and SG&A, and as you are seeing it at this play out. We are driving really strong top line momentum and driving strong gross margin and we're leveraging that to make strategic investments in SG&A to position ourselves better even for 2025 and beyond. Lauren indicated one of the technologies that we have implemented RFID in our stores. Which is allowing our store team members to quickly find the product and serve that athlete. As you can imagine, in apparel and footwear, it's really important to be able to quickly locate the product and service that athlete. And those are the examples of the investments that we are making which we believe will drive long-term returns as we look to 2025 and beyond. So, you know, in a summary, what I would say is look to us to continue to drive strong top line, and strong profitability improvement, but a little bit of an interplay between the margin and its\nSimeon Gutman: Perfect. Thanks. Good quarter and good luck on the holidays.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Congrats again. Another great quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you. Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question, you know, we talked in the prepared comments. You talked about the ongoing success of the new concepts, including the House of Sport. So I guess the question is this maybe you can remind us, you know, the rollout plan, you know, through the balance of 2024, but probably more importantly into 2025. And then how is this rollout now impacting comp store sales growth at DICK'S? Recognizing there's been some noise around sales growth with the calendar shift.\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Brian. I'll start just with an update on the House of Sport concept in general, and Navdeep will answer some of your more detailed questions. But House of Sport continues to be an incredibly impactful part of our long-term strategy. We just opened four more in the past couple of weeks. We had the opportunity to go visit many of them, and the impact they have in the community when they open is terrific. The experience is delighting athletes, we're seeing athletes drive longer distances. They're spending more time when they come. The community is just absolutely embracing House of Sport. Importantly, we're also seeing our vendor partners get very excited about the fact that they can bring their whole brand to life in a House of Sport, in particular in the collab spaces where we can tell this incredible brand story. Last thing I would just say is that landlords and mall operators are noticing that when we put a House of Sport into a mall, we get incredible traffic increases to the mall, which is obviously a win-win for everybody, but it's also allowing us to get access to even better long-term real estate opportunities. So we are really excited. I'll turn it to Navdeep to answer some of your more specific questions.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Brian, just to give some of the count information. So we finished last year with twelve House of Sport locations, and we expect to finish this year with approximately twenty House of Sport locations. What we have indicated is we plan to open another fifteen locations in 2025 with the long-term expectations of seventy-five to a hundred House of Sport locations by 2027. In terms of the comp definition, the vast majority of these House of Sport openings will be relocation or remodels of the existing locations. And they will continue to remain in our comp as have been. And so that's the reason you're not seeing that much of a difference come through between the comp and the total sales growth. We do selectively open new locations as well. For example, Prudential Center, our House of Sport location was a brand new location, but those will be far and few between so vast majority of these House of Sport locations will be within our comp composition as we look to the future.\nBrian Nagel: No. That's okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate all that. Then my follow-up question, I guess, near just with regard to guidance. I know it's a follow-up, so that maybe make it two parts anyway. So sorry about that. So and look. You beat Street in Q3. You lifted guidance for the full year. Are you taking up guidance for the, you know, you're putting your internal projections for the fourth quarter? And then with regard to, and I know you mentioned and others and a lot of talked about, you know, the impact of this shortened holiday season. You know, how are you thinking about I mean, I was in one of your stores, I guess, last weekend. I saw a lot of holiday signage already. So it seems like, you know, you're doing what you can kind of pull forward. But how are you thinking just about what how the impacts could play out here from this, you know, fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas?\nLauren Hobart: Yep. Thanks, Brian. So to your point, we beat our Q3 estimates and did lift our guidance, and that is reflecting both the confidence that we have in the momentum in the business and all of the long-term strategies that I mentioned. We're super excited about holiday, by the way. I would just point out that our stores, to your point, are looking amazing. Our online store is amazing. Our marketing kicked off a few weeks ago with JJ Watt, as I mentioned in the remarks. This is driving an incredible buzz and our team is extremely pumped. So we're excited about Q4. We did want to be appropriately cautious given the two factors. One being just the uncertain macroeconomic environment, and then also the fewer holiday days. There's five fewer. We're waking up and talking to it. I'm hearing even people in my life talk about how, oh my gosh, Christmas is coming. They have to quickly accelerate the gift buying, but we've been prepared for this. You know, Black Friday and holiday has expanded into the early weeks of November for many years now, and we've started our stores are ready, our online store is ready. So, we are excited about it. Just being appropriately cautious. Navdeep, what could you add?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Just to build, Brian, on what Lauren said. So as we indicated today, we have raised both our comp and the EPS expectations for the full year. In Q3, you know, we delivered really strong results. So we definitely look to that opportunity to translate that beat in terms of our full-year expectations. In terms of Q4, what we have indicated, we have raised our top-line expectations driven by the fact that how strongly we feel our inventory position is, how well ready our stores and our website are for the holiday selling season. But we are, as you can imagine, we are balancing that against the macroeconomic uncertainties as well as the short holiday calendar that Lauren talked about. In terms of the full-year EPS expectations, we have raised that as well. And within that, you have the composition of the margins being raised a little bit versus our prior expectations. Offset by the SG&A investment opportunities that we see to continue to take advantage of the opportunities we see position the business better for 2025. So overall, really excited about the results we posted as well as the confidence we have for Q4 and beyond.\nBrian Nagel: Great. Well, I appreciate all the color. Congrats again. Best of luck for the holiday.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Because it's come up a couple of times with the commentary around differentiation, and I know that's been a big driver of growth for you. How much would you say your product overlaps with retailers today, and how has that changed?\nLauren Hobart: Kate, thanks for the question. Yeah. We have really been leaning into differentiation across the board. And if you look at our footwear, we have highly differentiated product. If you look at even some of the exclusives, we have across our hardline businesses, there's exclusives even in team sports and things like that. So we have a highly differentiated product. It does allow us to be much more surgical when, where, and how we participate in any sort of promotional activity. We're just less vulnerable to the entire market going up and down, it continues to be a core strategy of us. We don't release the exact amount that our products overlap, but\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Kate, and just to build on what Lauren said, the other portfolio that we have in our assortment and that we are really excited about is our vertical brands. So our vertical brands, especially when you think of the flagship vertical brand, CALIA, DSG. Those brands are resonating so well with our athletes and we continue to see that as an opportunity to not only differentiate our assortment, but our overall basket building opportunity that we provide to these athletes. So, yeah. No. Our key driver of both the top-line momentum as well as the margin gains that we have been driving is driven by the work that our merchandising team is doing. In creating these curated assortments and having in-depth presentation of these products available in stores and online.\nKate McShane: Okay. And then our follow-up question. Thank you. Was on the drivers of ticket during the quarter. It seems like ticket increased a little bit more than what we've seen. Much of that is just same SKU inflation versus mix of what you sold in Q3?\nNavdeep Gupta: Kate, I would say it's pretty consistent with what we have been talking about the drivers of the ticket. It goes back to your prior question. It is driven by the differentiated product that we have access to. And what Lauren called out in her remarks that, you know, this curated and differentiated product is not exposed to kind of the promotional pressures that may be out there. So we are able to get recovery on the margin as well, and that also helps us drive a higher ticket. So it's, again, the differentiated product, and the pricing opportunity that we see.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Ohmes: Oh, hey. Congrats, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, just two quicker questions. One, can you guys talk a little more about Game Changer, remind us the flow through and remind us the long-term opportunity there? And then the second one is, can you give a little more color on some of the key new brand partnerships you see coming down the pike for House of Sport?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robbie. We're so excited about Game Changer. The Game Changer business continues to do really well. And for those of you who I know engage with it for your kids, you love it, but we are now forecasting for this year $100 million in Game Changer revenue, and it's a highly profitable software as a subscription model. It just continues to grow and dominate in the youth sports tech space. This past quarter for Game Changer, we had 5.5 million unique active users, which was a 21% increase over last year, and they're averaging up approximately two million active users in the app every single day. The Game Changer business is moving into more and more video streaming opportunities, which is enabling us to open basketball and some other sports. And those video increases video games that were streamed increased 50%. So just from a strategic standpoint, we feel like Game Changer and DICK'S are so well aligned. We actually co-presented what we call the Batlab this past weekend in Florida where athletes from across the country were able to come in and demo all the bats and give ratings and it's just so exciting to see that brand become an even bigger part of our ecosystem.\nNavdeep Gupta: Robbie, thanks for your comments. So let me build a little bit on what Lauren said in terms of the Game Changer platform and the excitement that we have, not just about the platform, but the combined capability on what it can mean for the athletes at DICK'S holistically. So like Lauren indicated, the size of the business that we have indicated, we expect this business to be about $100 million of sales in 2024. And it's growing at 30 to 40% CAGR each year, and that has been the CAGR of this business for the last several years. So couldn't be more excited about the size of the business, the top-line momentum that the team is able to drive, as well as the profitability of the business. As you can imagine, a SaaS business is extremely profitable. So it's a great complement to our capabilities. In terms of the long-term opportunity, we believe that the youth sports tech landscape is multibillion-dollar. And as you can imagine, with $100 million, and probably the best tool that is out there in the marketplace, we feel that this opportunity is really ripe for continued growth into the future.\nRobbie Ohmes: Thank you. That's great. And brand opportunities?\nLauren Hobart: Oh, yes. Thank you. Your second question. So House of Sport has been fantastic for us because of the key brand partnerships. That we have been able to expand and also build. So even our national brands have just loved being able to bring their brand to life. In our collab spaces, but we've also had exciting partnerships with new and emerging brands, things like GOAT, the Lacrosse brand that we're very excited about. Right now, there's an incredible holiday presentation. Our vertical brands are being demoed in the collab space. We continue to have tons with Free People Movement came into our collab space. So there's a lot of brands that have come in through House of Sport that have translated into big brand partners for us and that are transferring through the entire chain.\nRobbie Ohmes: Terrific. I look forward to being in one of your HOS stores on Black Friday.\nLauren Hobart: Yay. Thanks, Robbie. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another good quarter. Navdeep, on slide eleven, you've had this slide in the deck for several earnings calls now. The $35 million in omnichannel House of Sport sales and then the $14 million in DICK'S Fieldhouse omnichannel sales in year one. With the 20% four-wall on the EBITDA margin. How does this trend how do you model this or expect this to trend into year two and three as these stores mature? I would imagine the House of Sport open to very high levels of productivity. How do these contribute to the comps, the store productivity, and EBIT margin in year two and three? Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. John, great question. And we have talked about this in the product calls as well. We could not be more excited about not only how strongly these stores are opening in year one, both the House of Sport as well as Fieldhouse, but the comp trajectory that we are seeing in the select group of stores that have actually come one full year around in the second and on some stores actually in the third year. On the trajectory that we are seeing in year two, we had these stores come positively in the second year as well. Because the excitement continues to build. Two, we are able to engage with the athletes in a slightly different way because our team members learn, the community learns, on what and how to engage with the kind of the experiences that are within the store, whether it is the field that is within the store, the climbing wall, the community center that is within the store, all of those become a little bit of a deeper point of engagement, within the local markets. So we are excited about the trajectory that we see in year two. So we'll continue to provide more color as we learn more, but right now, based on the trends that we have seen, we're excited about the overall opportunity as well as the results that we see in year two.\nJohn Kernan: That's helpful. Thank you. I guess my follow-up is just on the soft lines piece of the business. I think it's been a big driver of comps for several quarters now. Dating back to last year. Can you talk about the outlook for the footwear business, footwear decks, and how many more footwear decks you can put in place? How many doors are on in HOKA? Can they be in additionally to what they're already in now? And the outlook for that key part of the business in Q4?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. First of all, maybe I'll start back more at the core category. So we have said there are four core categories where we are focused on driving our business. And those are athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports, and golf. When you look at it and you look at not just the performance in those categories as well as our results that we have delivered over the last several quarters, our growth continues to come from our core categories. And these are the exact categories we are continuing to gain strong share in the marketplace as well. When it comes to the footwear, we call it footwear as the engine that drives the tail. The amount of focus and attention that our merchandising team provides on that or puts on that, the supply chain team, works closely with the store organization. The work that we have done, not just in premium full-service footwear deck, but on house please. Capability that we have in our stores is allowing us to really differentiate the assortment that we have in our store, the service levels that we have in our stores, and most importantly, how well for the athletic footwear as well as the lifestyle footwear assortment that is available in our store. So we continue to be really excited about the opportunity in both in footwear and in just to add a little bit on the brand result itself, we have on HOKA, Nike, New Balance. And so we are excited about the brand assortment that we have available in these stores as well. Ninety percent of our stores today have premium full-service with Webex, and we see opportunities to continue to expand on HOKA further deeper into our chain.\nJohn Kernan: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJulie Wasserman: Hi. This is Julie Wasserman on for Christopher Horvers. Thank you for taking our questions. Our first question is on your updated view for merch margin in Q4. I know you spoke a little bit about the full year. And right now, is it any different from what you were thinking in September how Q3 played out relative to your expectations? And also in shrink came in better than expected, if that was normalized to 2019 models?\nNavdeep Gupta: So let me start with Q3 results and then I'll talk to Q4. So Q4 sorry. On Q3, like we said, our gross profit increased 67 basis points and the merch margin increased 83 basis points. The merch margin increase on a year-over-year basis in Q3 was primarily driven by the mix and the quality of the product and the assortment that we had available. So as we look to Q4, what we have guided is the expectation that our merch margin will see how it plays out with all of the promotional landscape in the fourth quarter, but right now, our expectation in our merch margin will increase again in the fourth quarter. In terms of the shrink, the shrink results came in slightly better to in line with our expectations in Q3. And right now, our expectation for shrink for Q4 is to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in Q4.\nJulie Wasserman: Got it. And our follow-up question I know you spoke a little bit to weather earlier in the call with fleece, but we were wondering if you could speak more to the cadence with the election hurricane's warm weather throughout the quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Yeah. So we said we had a really strong back-to-school season, so that was obviously early in the quarter. We had great growth in footwear, apparel, team sports. It was warmer than we might have liked in the last part of the quarter, but it didn't have a material impact on our comps. And we're being very excited about Q4.\nJulie Wasserman: An election pullback?\nLauren Hobart: We yeah. We didn't see anything meaningful. It's good that I think it's good for the country that there's some certainty, and we're seeing people nothing was material in the quarter. We're seeing the consumer just fine after that.\nJulie Wasserman: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As you look to 2025, would you expect that your merchandise margin will continue to expand and what opportunities outside of private label and inventory management might you have to drive further merch margin expansion into next year, especially because you'll be coming off of a pretty strong merch margin year this year?\nNavdeep Gupta: Michael, thanks for the question. And we'll give more specific 2025 guidance in the next quarter. Way to think about merch margin and quite frankly the opportunity that we have set pretty consistently in the last few years, is, again, going back to the three big players that we see an opportunity to grow our merchandise. First and foremost is the quality of the assortment. The differentiated assortment, the access that we have, and being able to control the full-price selling opportunity, that continues to be a big driver. Not just other results that we have posted, in the recent years and as well as as we look to the future. Second, the work that our pricing and allows us to be really surgical and one on one basis to be able to offer the right level of promotion and pricing offerings to our athletes. And that's a capability that we'll continue to leverage to continue to optimize our price and the promotions. And the last thing that you called out is the opportunity we see with the vertical brands. Vertical brands carry six to eight hundred basis points of higher margins compared to the national brands. So the more we're able to drive the penetration there as we have been able to do with CALIA, DSG, especially our flagship apparel brands, we see that opportunity to be even better as we go into the future. The biggest unknown right now, which we talked earlier in the call, is around tariffs. So we'll provide appropriate level of details at the next earnings call for 2025.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is, your inventory is running up just under about half a billion dollars year over year. There may be some timing given the calendar end impact on that. In the past, the market might have been concerned that would have created more merchandise margin headwind. Now it seems like DICK'S has a better engine to be able to clear that out through the Going, Going, Gone chain. So a, is there less risk that you will be stuck in an inventory a heavy inventory position that could create the merchandise margin risk in the fourth quarter? And I know you said you expect merch margins to be up in the fourth quarter, but it's I believe your guidance is up only forty basis points for the year. So far, on average, each quarter, you've been up about seventy basis points. So a, how does that math work? And b, what's going to drive the merch margin expansion in the fourth quarter, especially in light of the inventory position. Thank you very much.\nLauren Hobart: Yep. Thanks, Michael. I think your question is well taken. And I want to be really clear about the fact that we are really strategic and surgical in how we have invested in inventory in key items, key categories, and things that we don't think are going to become toxic and we're not concerned are going to create a heavy markdown risk, as you mentioned. We have guided, as you said, to a Q4 margin increase. And we are really confident this inventory is a key part of our strategy to really lean into having the right stuff for our athletes when they come into our store and online.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Michael, I'll build on what Lauren said. So you called out that the forty basis points is the EBT expansion that we have at the midpoint. So a couple of things to keep in mind as you're thinking about fourth quarter, and this was included in my add comments. It will have an unfavorable impact to our sales to the tune of $200 million and that will that is driven by the fifty-third week last year as well as the calendar shift that we have talked about. The other is our preopening expenses in Q4 are going to be slightly higher than past year, and hopefully, you saw that our preopening expenses in Q3 came in under our expectations that we have shared as well. And that is primarily driven by the shift of some timing of the new store opening. As Lauren called out that we opened three new House of Sport locations right at the beginning of Q4. There's a little bit of an impact in the profitability improvement on a Q4 basis when you consider the impact of reopening shift, as well as the $200 million of unfavorable impact. And then the last thing I would call out is, as expected, you can expect some level of caution that we have included in our guidance, considering the macro and the shorter holiday. So it's a combination of those three or four things that you are seeing the profitability impact in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much, and good luck.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nKelly: Hi. This is Kelly on for Paul. Thanks for taking your question. Could you just elaborate more on your philosophy around SG&A? If you see sales and gross margin materialize ahead of plan, should we expect you to continue to invest some of the upside in key initiatives? Any chance you can quantify the impact of higher incentive comp on SG&A this year? And could you give us an idea of what sort of comp you need to leverage fixed cost within gross margin, SG&A as we look to FY25 and beyond?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Kelly, I think that there were a couple of questions there in that. So I think so maybe we'll start with the philosophy. Like I said before, our philosophy is to drive top line and bottom line growth for the company. And continue to position the company for the long-term growth, whether it is House of Sport, opportunity we see in investment, technology capabilities that we see in investment opportunities in. We will make appropriate decisions on where the investments need to be made. Sometimes the investments need to be made on the margin side. For example, opening up the distribution center that we have talked about, in the near future. So that will be on the margin side or the technology investments which predominantly sit within the SG&A. In terms of the expectations for the outlook for the SG&A for future year, I would say, you know, we'll provide our 2025 guidance in the next quarter, but you can continue to look to us to drive the top line and the bottom line improvement. In terms of the comp needed to leverage SG&A, it'll all depend on where and what levels of investments we see. So I don't know if I want to give a specific number associated with that, but I would say, you know, the focus for us is continuing to drive the top line and the bottom line improvement.\nKelly: Thank you. And just to follow-up, I think you said you can open another fifteen House of Sport locations in 2025. Is that the total sort of new store openings we should have expected in FY25? Meaning, does that include the Fieldhouse concepts? And just could you give us more color on the relocations versus remodels of existing locations? Specifically, what sort of, you know, what level of remodels do you expect to do in 2025 in any color on the list productivity list you see after you do a remodel. Thanks.\nNavdeep Gupta: Okay. Kelly, there were a number of questions there, and I'll see if I can address all of them. So first of all, in terms of the store count, the fifteen House of Sport openings are just House of Sport openings. On top of that, we expect to open an additional twenty Fieldhouse locations. There will be some Golf Galaxy openings as well, and we'll provide the store count and the new store opening expectations in 2025. However, I want to reiterate again something that I said before. That vast majority of the Fieldhouse locations as well as House of Sport locations, especially the House of Sport locations, will be relocation or remodeled. So you won't see a lot of new store count happening as we look to 2025 as well. If you look at the results, other than the store count that we have provided for 2024, we are seeing only a 2% increase in square footage on a year-over-year basis. Driven by the new store openings. So we'll provide more details, as we share our 2025 outlook. For the new store count openings.\nKelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question will come from Justin Kleber with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJustin Kleber: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Lauren, you mentioned in your response to a prior question that the tail end of the quarter being softer. I guess that's not surprising given how warm October was. But did that softer exit rate play a role in the transaction decline that you experienced in the third quarter?\nLauren Hobart: No. And thank you for asking the question because I want to clear that up. We had a great quarter. We had every month was a great quarter. And so all I was mentioning is that weather did not play a material impact in the quarter overall, and maybe we saw a little bit of it in the back half. So I just don't want you to take away that we had a dip in the tail end of the quarter.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. Justin and just to add to what Lauren said, you know, you see the puts and takes with the weather within our portfolio of categories that have. So if you see a softer performance in the cold weather categories, what you also saw or you also see is some of the favorable trends in the categories that do well in kind of the moderate temperatures. So for example, the golf business actually exceeded our expectations in the back half. So, you know, but this is the reason we really like the portfolio of products that we have that interplay between these categories, you know, doesn't insulate us from the weather impact, but it allows us to navigate the month-over-month transitions as well. Much better than we have been able to do in the past.\nJustin Kleber: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that, Navdeep. And then my follow-up is just given the continued strength in House of Sport, I wanted to ask about what elements of House of Sport are you finding most impactful within the Fieldhouse stores?\nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks. Great question. As you're pointing out, that House of Sport is doing so well for all the reasons talked about, and it's such an exciting concept. But it is the cornerstone of our strategy to just reposition our entire portfolio. And what we mean by that is, you know, the things that are doing so great and are such a big part of House of Sport are things like improved service, better assortment and access to product, experiences. All of those things are translating into our Fieldhouse concept, which is honestly from a visual presentation standpoint, looks just like a House of Sport, a smaller version of a House of Sport. But it has a lot of those elevated aspects to the degree that we can fit them into a fifty thousand square foot box. But it's also translating through our entire organization. So things like the elevated service, elevating product, you're going to see that as we reposition our entire portfolio, House of Sport has a longer impact than you might think just looking at the House of Sport stores.\nOperator: I will now turn the conference back over to Lauren Hobart, Chief Executive Officer, for closing comments.\nLauren Hobart: Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I hope everyone has a happy holiday. And to our team, I'm excited to see you out in stores this week. Have a great holiday weekend. Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered another strong quarter. We are very proud of our Q3 results and our performance year to date. These results show how well our long-term strategies are working and the great execution from our team. Our Q3 comps increased 4.2%, driven by our four strategic pillars: omnichannel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, deep engagement with the DICK'S brand, and our knowledgeable and passionate teammates who are integral to our success. We had an excellent back-to-school season and continue to gain market share. Our third-quarter gross margin expanded 67 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results, driven by higher merchandise margin. And we delivered EPS of $2.75. As a result of our strong performance in the quarter, and the continued confidence we have in our business, we are again raising our full-year outlook. We now expect comp sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.6% to 4.2%, and EPS to be in the range of $13.65 to $13.95. At the heart of our long-term strategy is the omnichannel athlete. We are continuing to invest across our digital and store experiences with a focus on elevating training, service, and product knowledge to drive enhanced engagement with our athletes. We feel great about the strong performance of health of sport and strong engagement with our athletes. We are redefining sports retail and creating brand partners and communities. We continue to see sport having a strong influence on culture and culture on sport. And our health of sport concept is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of all athletes across both performance and lifestyle. In Q3, we opened three House of Sport locations, followed by two more earlier this month, bringing us to nineteen now open ahead of the holiday season. In 2025, we expect to open approximately six Health and Support locations, and we remain on track to have seventy-five to a hundred locations open by 2027. Inspired by health of sport, we continue to revolutionize our fifty thousand square foot DICK'S stores with a next-generation format which we refer to internally as our Fieldhouse concept. These stores continue to do very well in both sales and profitability. In Q3, we opened five Fieldhouse locations, followed by another four earlier this month, bringing us to twenty-six now open. In 2025, we expect to open approximately twenty Fieldhouse locations. The Texas market is an exciting growth opportunity for us, and one of the areas where we are investing in new health support locations in marketing, in our infrastructure to enhance the omnichannel experience for our athletes and capture this potential. This quarter, we broke ground on the new distribution center we've been planning in Fort Worth, Texas, which is expected to open in early 2026. Our digital capabilities are central to our omnichannel athlete experience. We continue to improve the shopping experience for our athletes, including on DICKS.com and our DICK'S mobile app. Our elevated and diverse assortment uniquely positions us as the destination for new products. And this past quarter, we expanded our product launch reservations in our DICK'S app beyond footwear to include product drops across other key categories. We're also giving our teammates new and improved technology tools to help them find the right product quicker, including expanding our use of RFID technology. As we discussed, Game Changer continues to be a key part of our digital strategy and is strengthening our leadership in the multibillion-dollar youth sports tech ecosystem. Over 5.5 million unique users were active on Game Changer in the third quarter, a 21% increase from last year. And we had approximately two million average daily active users in the Game Changer app during the quarter. Providing differentiated on-trend products helps make DICK'S the go-to destination for sport in the US. Our health of sport and Fieldhouse concepts have opened doors to new brand partnerships and strengthened existing relationships as they enable us to showcase our brand partners and vertical brands in a way no one else can. Our priority categories continue to perform very well, led by important national brands and our flagship vertical brands. And we have deliberately taken steps to be fully stocked across key products and categories for holiday shopping. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the product pipeline into next year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong third-quarter results and are highly confident in our long-term strategies to drive sustained sales and profit growth. We believe our differentiated product quality, service, and powerful omnichannel experience will resonate well with our athletes this holiday season, along with this year's really fun holiday campaign featuring NFL legend JJ Watt and his family. It's just driving so much buzz. I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods and their focus on delivering great experiences for our athletes this holiday season. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Adrienne. Yeah. We are really pleased with the comp that we just put up. And to your point, we have had three quarters in a row now of over a 4% comp. And I think it really is a testament to the fact that our long-term strategies are working. And I would point to the access that we've had continued to gain to differentiated product. Our merchant team has done an absolutely amazing job in your point, a multibrand retail strategy between our national partners and our vertical brands. And at the same time, our team throughout the entire organization is executing at such an incredibly high level. So we're really able to serve athletes with the products that they need and do it in a way that is increasingly engaging and a really fun experience. It's important, I think, to look at our athlete and how athletes are doing. They have been for some time prioritizing healthy and active lifestyle. They're prioritizing team sports. We saw a tremendous gain in the back-to-school categories this past quarter. So footwear, apparel, team sports, but also prioritizing just outdoor living, golf, really all of the athletic categories and just being outside. We saw 1.5 million more athletes enter our ecosystem over the past quarter, and we saw growth across all income demographics. So, again, to your point, we are sort of seeing different trends perhaps in the industry would be saying. Would point to the fact that we're in such an exciting time in sport and an exciting time in the industry. The country is really having what we're calling a sport moment. And if you think about it, between women's basketball, which is just on fire, and the expanded NCAA playoffs for football this year, and then the fact that the World Cup is going to be mostly in the US in 2026 and the Olympics in LA in 2028, we really expect that sport is going to continue to have an outsized influence on culture. And culture on sport. And I really think DICK'S is in such a great lane to just ride those trends in that we are rooted in. We are all the performance merchandising gear you could ever want, but we increasingly also have product that is the lifestyle of sport. And so, that's why we have such confidence in our athlete and our growth going forward. Thank you. Thanks, Simeon. And, yes, I'm glad you asked. I want to discuss the inventory investment that we've made in inventory. We have made a conscious decision over the course of several quarters now to invest in our highly differentiated assortment. And this quarter, the inventory that we ended the quarter with is complete with things like key items, key brands, things like fleece, things like footwear, the licensed opportunity that I just mentioned with the NCAA playoff expansion. And so we don't peanut butter spread the inventory across the categories. We're very surgical and strategic about it. We have two exciting opportunities that some of this inventory is meant to address going into Q4. One of which is that around the holiday season leading into, like, the last days of Christmas or right before Christmas, we sometimes were broken on size and color for some of our key items, say Nike fleece and things like that. So we will be addressing that with the inventory. We also feel like we have an opportunity in our warmer weather climates to transition out of holiday and into our spring merchandise even earlier. So we've accelerated some of that. So these many of these products will have life into 2025, and we should see the results in the back half of the quarter and into 2025. So we are very confident. You saw it. We just increased our guidance. Our comp guidance implied in Q4 has increased as well, so we're very pleased. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. I'll start just with an update on the House of Sport concept in general, and Navdeep will answer some of your more detailed questions. But House of Sport continues to be an incredibly impactful part of our long-term strategy. We just opened four more in the past couple of weeks. We had the opportunity to go visit many of them, and the impact they have in the community when they open is terrific. The experience is delighting athletes, we're seeing athletes drive longer distances. They're spending more time when they come. The community is just absolutely embracing House of Sport. Importantly, we're also seeing our vendor partners get very excited about the fact that they can bring their whole brand to life in a House of Sport, in particular in the collab spaces where we can tell this incredible brand story. Last thing I would just say is that landlords and mall operators are noticing that when we put a House of Sport into a mall, we get incredible traffic increases to the mall, which is obviously a win-win for everybody, but it's also allowing us to get access to even better long-term real estate opportunities. So we are really excited. I'll turn it to Navdeep to answer some of your more specific questions. Yep. Thanks, Brian. So to your point, we beat our Q3 estimates and did lift our guidance, and that is reflecting both the confidence that we have in the momentum in the business and all of the long-term strategies that I mentioned. We're super excited about holiday, by the way. I would just point out that our stores, to your point, are looking amazing. Our online store is amazing. Our marketing kicked off a few weeks ago with JJ Watt, as I mentioned in the remarks. This is driving an incredible buzz and our team is extremely pumped. So we're excited about Q4. We did want to be appropriately cautious given the two factors. One being just the uncertain macroeconomic environment, and then also the fewer holiday days. There's five fewer. We're waking up and talking to it. I'm hearing even people in my life talk about how, oh my gosh, Christmas is coming. They have to quickly accelerate the gift buying, but we've been prepared for this. You know, Black Friday and holiday has expanded into the early weeks of November for many years now, and we've started our stores are ready, our online store is ready. So, we are excited about it. Just being appropriately cautious. Navdeep, what could you add? Kate, thanks for the question. Yeah. We have really been leaning into differentiation across the board. And if you look at our footwear, we have highly differentiated product. If you look at even some of the exclusives, we have across our hardline businesses, there's exclusives even in team sports and things like that. So we have a highly differentiated product. It does allow us to be much more surgical when, where, and how we participate in any sort of promotional activity. We're just less vulnerable to the entire market going up and down, it continues to be a core strategy of us. We don't release the exact amount that our products overlap, but Thanks, Robbie. We're so excited about Game Changer. The Game Changer business continues to do really well. And for those of you who I know engage with it for your kids, you love it, but we are now forecasting for this year $100 million in Game Changer revenue, and it's a highly profitable software as a subscription model. It just continues to grow and dominate in the youth sports tech space. This past quarter for Game Changer, we had 5.5 million unique active users, which was a 21% increase over last year, and they're averaging up approximately two million active users in the app every single day. The Game Changer business is moving into more and more video streaming opportunities, which is enabling us to open basketball and some other sports. And those video increases video games that were streamed increased 50%. So just from a strategic standpoint, we feel like Game Changer and DICK'S are so well aligned. We actually co-presented what we call the Batlab this past weekend in Florida where athletes from across the country were able to come in and demo all the bats and give ratings and it's just so exciting to see that brand become an even bigger part of our ecosystem. Oh, yes. Thank you. Your second question. So House of Sport has been fantastic for us because of the key brand partnerships. That we have been able to expand and also build. So even our national brands have just loved being able to bring their brand to life. In our collab spaces, but we've also had exciting partnerships with new and emerging brands, things like GOAT, the Lacrosse brand that we're very excited about. Right now, there's an incredible holiday presentation. Our vertical brands are being demoed in the collab space. We continue to have tons with Free People Movement came into our collab space. So there's a lot of brands that have come in through House of Sport that have translated into big brand partners for us and that are transferring through the entire chain. Yay. Thanks, Robbie. Thank you. Yeah. So we said we had a really strong back-to-school season, so that was obviously early in the quarter. We had great growth in footwear, apparel, team sports. It was warmer than we might have liked in the last part of the quarter, but it didn't have a material impact on our comps. And we're being very excited about Q4. We yeah. We didn't see anything meaningful. It's good that I think it's good for the country that there's some certainty, and we're seeing people nothing was material in the quarter. We're seeing the consumer just fine after that. Thank you. Yep. Thanks, Michael. I think your question is well taken. And I want to be really clear about the fact that we are really strategic and surgical in how we have invested in inventory in key items, key categories, and things that we don't think are going to become toxic and we're not concerned are going to create a heavy markdown risk, as you mentioned. We have guided, as you said, to a Q4 margin increase. And we are really confident this inventory is a key part of our strategy to really lean into having the right stuff for our athletes when they come into our store and online. No. And thank you for asking the question because I want to clear that up. We had a great quarter. We had every month was a great quarter. And so all I was mentioning is that weather did not play a material impact in the quarter overall, and maybe we saw a little bit of it in the back half. So I just don't want you to take away that we had a dip in the tail end of the quarter. Yes. Thanks. Great question. As you're pointing out, that House of Sport is doing so well for all the reasons talked about, and it's such an exciting concept. But it is the cornerstone of our strategy to just reposition our entire portfolio. And what we mean by that is, you know, the things that are doing so great and are such a big part of House of Sport are things like improved service, better assortment and access to product, experiences.

But it has a lot of those elevated aspects to the degree that we can fit them into a fifty thousand square foot box. But it's also translating through our entire organization. So things like the elevated service, elevating product, you're going to see that as we reposition our entire portfolio, House of Sport has a longer impact than you might think just looking at the House of Sport stores. Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. I hope everyone has a happy holiday. And to our team, I'm excited to see you out in stores this week. Have a great holiday weekend. Thanks."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with some highlights of our strong year-to-date performance. Through the third quarter, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% to $9.55 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 4.7%, driven by a 3.7% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in transactions. EBT was $1.12 billion, or 11.75% of net sales. This is up from non-GAAP EBT of $975.3 million, or 10.71% of net sales in the same thirty-nine-week period last year. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $10.43. This compares to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $9.08 last year, an increase of 15% for the thirty-nine-week period. Now moving to our Q3 results. Adjusting for the calendar shift, which we believe provides the clearest view of the business, our Q3 comps increased 4.2% as we continue to gain market share. Our strong comps were driven by a 4.8% increase in average ticket and partially offset by a modest 0.6% decline in transactions. Our back-to-school categories did very well, with strength across footwear, athletic apparel, and team sports. Consolidated net sales increased 0.5% to $3.06 billion. As we previewed during the last quarter's call, this included the unfavorable impact of the calendar shift from the fifty-third week last year. As expected, this shifted a key back-to-school week out of Q3 and into Q2, unfavorably impacting third-quarter sales by approximately $105 million and $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Gross profit for the third quarter remains strong at $1.09 billion, or 35.77% of net sales, and increased 67 basis points from last year's non-GAAP results. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin of 84 basis points due to favorable sales mix and the quality of our assortment. This was partially offset by expected deleverage on occupancy costs driven by the unfavorable impact to our total sales from the calendar shift. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 7.2% to $787.1 million and deleveraged 162 basis points compared to last year's non-GAAP results. This year-over-year deleverage was expected, with approximately 65 basis points of this increase due to the unfavorable impact to our reported total sales from the calendar shift. The remaining increase was driven by strategic investments primarily across marketing, technology, and talent based on the strength of our business as well as higher incentive compensation. Reopening expenses were $16.8 million, a decrease of $3.6 million compared to the prior year and favorable to both our expectations due to differences in timing of new store openings. EBT was $297.1 million, or 9.7% of net sales. This compares to a non-GAAP EBT of $341.1 million, or 10.6% of net sales in Q3 of 2023. This included an unfavorable impact from the calendar shift of approximately 95 basis points. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $2.75. This compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.85 last year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year included an unfavorable impact from the calendar shift of $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Now looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 13% compared to Q3 of last year. As we have talked about previously, to maximize the benefit of our differentiated assortment, we have made a conscious decision to lean into key items and categories which we expect to drive our growth in Q4 as well as into early 2025. Our investment is in some of our strongest product offerings, and we believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned as we enter the post-quarter. In fact, our clearance inventory is down meaningfully. Turning to our third-quarter capital allocation, net capital expenditures were approximately $185 million, and we paid $90 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased approximately 35,000 shares of our stock for $6.7 million at an average price of $194.22. Thus far this year, we have repurchased a total of $170.3 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $300 million. Now moving to our outlook for 2024. As Lauren said, we are again raising our full-year outlook. This reflects our strong Q3 performance and our confidence in our strategic initiatives and operational strength balanced against the dynamic macroeconomic environment and shorter traditional holiday shopping season. We now expect consolidated net sales in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion, compared to our prior expectation of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. We don't expect full-year comp sales growth in the range of 3.6% to 4.2%, compared to our prior expectation of 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Driven by the quality of assortment, we continue to expect gross margin to expand year over year and now anticipate it will slightly exceed our prior expectations. Based on the strength of our business, we are making strategic investments to better position ourselves for 2025 and over the long term, and continue to expect SG&A to deleverage year over year. We continue to expect EBT margins to be at 11.2% of sales at the midpoint. In total, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.65 to $13.95, compared to our prior expectation of $13.55 to $13.90. Our own guidance is based on approximately 82 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 23%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, keep in mind due to the impact of the shifted calendar, our reported total sales and EPS benefited by approximately $35 million or approximately $0.10 per diluted share through the first three quarters of the year. We expect a modestly unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter of approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share. On a full-year basis, this shift will not impact our results. Furthermore, recall that last year's fifty-third week added $170 million or $0.19 per diluted share in Q4 2023. In total, Q4 compares versus last year will be unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million in sales and approximately $0.29 in earnings per diluted share. This all has been contemplated within our updated guidance. In closing, we are very pleased with our third-quarter performance and the success of our long-term strategy. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yeah. Adrienne, thanks for that question. First of all, thank you for your comments on the Q3 results as well. We couldn't be more excited about the results that we have delivered here in Q3. In terms of tariffs, I think so I would say that's that a slightly more information is known. We still don't know about the timing and the likely the categories that would be impacted. So still a lot to be learned more. But like you said, you know, we have navigated this situation back in 2018, 2019, effectively as well. Vertical brands perspective, we have a very small actually very, very negligible amount of exposure because we have diversified our supply chain both from China as well as there's not much of an exposure even if you look into we feel we are well positioned for that. And then like Lauren indicated, we have very strong partnership with our national brand vendors. So as more is learned, we'll continue to navigate that in close partnership with our national brand vendors as well. Overall, if you look back to how we navigated this in 2018, 2019, that'll be kind of the playbook that will follow here again, as more is known. And, Simeon, let me just build on what Lauren said. The inventory is right in line with our expectation, and you called out a little bit on the colder weather impact. I would say, you know, the weather is still very early part of Q4. Vast majority of the holiday selling season is ahead of us. So we feel really good about the quality of the inventory. We also called out that the clearance levels continue to be really well managed. It's actually down significantly. So overall, really excited about the composition of the inventory, how well that inventory is positioned in the key categories. And based on that confidence, we raised our Q4 expectation on our full-year comp expectations as well. Yeah. Simeon, maybe I'll start with the full-year guidance that we have issued. And, you know, in another quarter, we'll be providing a little bit of a further outlook for 2025. So let's start with the results that we have posted as well as the guidance that we have issued. So first of all, we couldn't be more excited about the 4.7% comp that we have posted year to date and the guidance that we have issued. And at the midpoint of our guidance, our comp will be approximately 4%, which is on top of a 2.6% growth account growth last year. And like you indicated, our expectation is that the merch margin at the midpoint will expand on a forty basis points on a year-over-year basis as well. So said in effect that the way we are thinking about our focus in driving the business is to continue to drive the strong top line and strong bottom line improvement. There will be puts and takes between the margin and SG&A, and as you are seeing it at this play out. We are driving really strong top line momentum and driving strong gross margin and we're leveraging that to make strategic investments in SG&A to position ourselves better even for 2025 and beyond. Lauren indicated one of the technologies that we have implemented RFID in our stores. Which is allowing our store team members to quickly find the product and serve that athlete. As you can imagine, in apparel and footwear, it's really important to be able to quickly locate the product and service that athlete. And those are the examples of the investments that we are making which we believe will drive long-term returns as we look to 2025 and beyond. So, you know, in a summary, what I would say is look to us to continue to drive strong top line, and strong profitability improvement, but a little bit of an interplay between the margin and its Thank you. Yeah. Brian, just to give some of the count information. So we finished last year with twelve House of Sport locations, and we expect to finish this year with approximately twenty House of Sport locations. What we have indicated is we plan to open another fifteen locations in 2025 with the long-term expectations of seventy-five to a hundred House of Sport locations by 2027. In terms of the comp definition, the vast majority of these House of Sport openings will be relocation or remodels of the existing locations. And they will continue to remain in our comp as have been. And so that's the reason you're not seeing that much of a difference come through between the comp and the total sales growth. We do selectively open new locations as well. For example, Prudential Center, our House of Sport location was a brand new location, but those will be far and few between so vast majority of these House of Sport locations will be within our comp composition as we look to the future. Yeah. Just to build, Brian, on what Lauren said. So as we indicated today, we have raised both our comp and the EPS expectations for the full year. In Q3, you know, we delivered really strong results. So we definitely look to that opportunity to translate that beat in terms of our full-year expectations. In terms of Q4, what we have indicated, we have raised our top-line expectations driven by the fact that how strongly we feel our inventory position is, how well ready our stores and our website are for the holiday selling season. But we are, as you can imagine, we are balancing that against the macroeconomic uncertainties as well as the short holiday calendar that Lauren talked about. In terms of the full-year EPS expectations, we have raised that as well. And within that, you have the composition of the margins being raised a little bit versus our prior expectations. Offset by the SG&A investment opportunities that we see to continue to take advantage of the opportunities we see position the business better for 2025. So overall, really excited about the results we posted as well as the confidence we have for Q4 and beyond. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. Kate, and just to build on what Lauren said, the other portfolio that we have in our assortment and that we are really excited about is our vertical brands. So our vertical brands, especially when you think of the flagship vertical brand, CALIA, DSG. Those brands are resonating so well with our athletes and we continue to see that as an opportunity to not only differentiate our assortment, but our overall basket building opportunity that we provide to these athletes. So, yeah. No. Our key driver of both the top-line momentum as well as the margin gains that we have been driving is driven by the work that our merchandising team is doing. In creating these curated assortments and having in-depth presentation of these products available in stores and online. Kate, I would say it's pretty consistent with what we have been talking about the drivers of the ticket. It goes back to your prior question. It is driven by the differentiated product that we have access to. And what Lauren called out in her remarks that, you know, this curated and differentiated product is not exposed to kind of the promotional pressures that may be out there. So we are able to get recovery on the margin as well, and that also helps us drive a higher ticket. So it's, again, the differentiated product, and the pricing opportunity that we see. Thank you. Robbie, thanks for your comments. So let me build a little bit on what Lauren said in terms of the Game Changer platform and the excitement that we have, not just about the platform, but the combined capability on what it can mean for the athletes at DICK'S holistically. So like Lauren indicated, the size of the business that we have indicated, we expect this business to be about $100 million of sales in 2024. And it's growing at 30 to 40% CAGR each year, and that has been the CAGR of this business for the last several years. So couldn't be more excited about the size of the business, the top-line momentum that the team is able to drive, as well as the profitability of the business. As you can imagine, a SaaS business is extremely profitable. So it's a great complement to our capabilities. In terms of the long-term opportunity, we believe that the youth sports tech landscape is multibillion-dollar. And as you can imagine, with $100 million, and probably the best tool that is out there in the marketplace, we feel that this opportunity is really ripe for continued growth into the future. Yeah. John, great question. And we have talked about this in the product calls as well. We could not be more excited about not only how strongly these stores are opening in year one, both the House of Sport as well as Fieldhouse, but the comp trajectory that we are seeing in the select group of stores that have actually come one full year around in the second and on some stores actually in the third year. On the trajectory that we are seeing in year two, we had these stores come positively in the second year as well. Because the excitement continues to build. Two, we are able to engage with the athletes in a slightly different way because our team members learn, the community learns, on what and how to engage with the kind of the experiences that are within the store, whether it is the field that is within the store, the climbing wall, the community center that is within the store, all of those become a little bit of a deeper point of engagement, within the local markets. So we are excited about the trajectory that we see in year two. So we'll continue to provide more color as we learn more, but right now, based on the trends that we have seen, we're excited about the overall opportunity as well as the results that we see in year two. Yeah. First of all, maybe I'll start back more at the core category. So we have said there are four core categories where we are focused on driving our business. And those are athletic apparel, athletic footwear, team sports, and golf. When you look at it and you look at not just the performance in those categories as well as our results that we have delivered over the last several quarters, our growth continues to come from our core categories. And these are the exact categories we are continuing to gain strong share in the marketplace as well. When it comes to the footwear, we call it footwear as the engine that drives the tail. The amount of focus and attention that our merchandising team provides on that or puts on that, the supply chain team, works closely with the store organization. The work that we have done, not just in premium full-service footwear deck, but on house please. Capability that we have in our stores is allowing us to really differentiate the assortment that we have in our store, the service levels that we have in our stores, and most importantly, how well for the athletic footwear as well as the lifestyle footwear assortment that is available in our store. So we continue to be really excited about the opportunity in both in footwear and in just to add a little bit on the brand result itself, we have on HOKA, Nike, New Balance. And so we are excited about the brand assortment that we have available in these stores as well. Ninety percent of our stores today have premium full-service with Webex, and we see opportunities to continue to expand on HOKA further deeper into our chain. So let me start with Q3 results and then I'll talk to Q4. So Q4 sorry. On Q3, like we said, our gross profit increased 67 basis points and the merch margin increased 83 basis points. The merch margin increase on a year-over-year basis in Q3 was primarily driven by the mix and the quality of the product and the assortment that we had available. So as we look to Q4, what we have guided is the expectation that our merch margin will see how it plays out with all of the promotional landscape in the fourth quarter, but right now, our expectation in our merch margin will increase again in the fourth quarter. In terms of the shrink, the shrink results came in slightly better to in line with our expectations in Q3. And right now, our expectation for shrink for Q4 is to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in Q4. Michael, thanks for the question. And we'll give more specific 2025 guidance in the next quarter. Way to think about merch margin and quite frankly the opportunity that we have set pretty consistently in the last few years, is, again, going back to the three big players that we see an opportunity to grow our merchandise. First and foremost is the quality of the assortment. The differentiated assortment, the access that we have, and being able to control the full-price selling opportunity, that continues to be a big driver. Not just other results that we have posted, in the recent years and as well as as we look to the future. Second, the work that our pricing and allows us to be really surgical and one on one basis to be able to offer the right level of promotion and pricing offerings to our athletes. And that's a capability that we'll continue to leverage to continue to optimize our price and the promotions. And the last thing that you called out is the opportunity we see with the vertical brands. Vertical brands carry six to eight hundred basis points of higher margins compared to the national brands. So the more we're able to drive the penetration there as we have been able to do with CALIA, DSG, especially our flagship apparel brands, we see that opportunity to be even better as we go into the future. The biggest unknown right now, which we talked earlier in the call, is around tariffs. So we'll provide appropriate level of details at the next earnings call for 2025. Yeah. Michael, I'll build on what Lauren said. So you called out that the forty basis points is the EBT expansion that we have at the midpoint. So a couple of things to keep in mind as you're thinking about fourth quarter, and this was included in my add comments. It will have an unfavorable impact to our sales to the tune of $200 million and that will that is driven by the fifty-third week last year as well as the calendar shift that we have talked about. The other is our preopening expenses in Q4 are going to be slightly higher than past year, and hopefully, you saw that our preopening expenses in Q3 came in under our expectations that we have shared as well. And that is primarily driven by the shift of some timing of the new store opening. As Lauren called out that we opened three new House of Sport locations right at the beginning of Q4. There's a little bit of an impact in the profitability improvement on a Q4 basis when you consider the impact of reopening shift, as well as the $200 million of unfavorable impact. And then the last thing I would call out is, as expected, you can expect some level of caution that we have included in our guidance, considering the macro and the shorter holiday. So it's a combination of those three or four things that you are seeing the profitability impact in the fourth quarter. Thank you. Yeah. Kelly, I think that there were a couple of questions there in that. So I think so maybe we'll start with the philosophy. Like I said before, our philosophy is to drive top line and bottom line growth for the company. And continue to position the company for the long-term growth, whether it is House of Sport, opportunity we see in investment, technology capabilities that we see in investment opportunities in. We will make appropriate decisions on where the investments need to be made. Sometimes the investments need to be made on the margin side. For example, opening up the distribution center that we have talked about, in the near future. So that will be on the margin side or the technology investments which predominantly sit within the SG&A. In terms of the expectations for the outlook for the SG&A for future year, I would say, you know, we'll provide our 2025 guidance in the next quarter, but you can continue to look to us to drive the top line and the bottom line improvement. In terms of the comp needed to leverage SG&A, it'll all depend on where and what levels of investments we see. So I don't know if I want to give a specific number associated with that, but I would say, you know, the focus for us is continuing to drive the top line and the bottom line improvement. Okay. Kelly, there were a number of questions there, and I'll see if I can address all of them. So first of all, in terms of the store count, the fifteen House of Sport openings are just House of Sport openings. On top of that, we expect to open an additional twenty Fieldhouse locations. There will be some Golf Galaxy openings as well, and we'll provide the store count and the new store opening expectations in 2025. However, I want to reiterate again something that I said before. That vast majority of the Fieldhouse locations as well as House of Sport locations, especially the House of Sport locations, will be relocation or remodeled. So you won't see a lot of new store count happening as we look to 2025 as well. If you look at the results, other than the store count that we have provided for 2024, we are seeing only a 2% increase in square footage on a year-over-year basis. Driven by the new store openings. So we'll provide more details, as we share our 2025 outlook. For the new store count openings. Yeah. Justin and just to add to what Lauren said, you know, you see the puts and takes with the weather within our portfolio of categories that have. So if you see a softer performance in the cold weather categories, what you also saw or you also see is some of the favorable trends in the categories that do well in kind of the moderate temperatures. So for example, the golf business actually exceeded our expectations in the back half. So, you know, but this is the reason we really like the portfolio of products that we have that interplay between these categories, you know, doesn't insulate us from the weather impact, but it allows us to navigate the month-over-month transitions as well. Much better than we have been able to do in the past."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Lauren.\nLauren Hobart : Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered a very strong quarter. Our Q2 results continue to demonstrate how well our long-term strategies are working and the great execution of our team. Powered by our compelling omni-channel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, best-in-class teammate experience, and our ability to create deep engagement with the DICK'S brand, we are driving sustained top-line momentum and gaining market share. I am really proud of our team. Today we are again raising our full year outlook. This reflects our strong Q2 results and the confidence we have in our business. We now expect comp sales growth for the year to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% and EPS to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.90. Now moving to our results. For the second quarter, our sales increased 7.8% to just under $3.5 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 4.5%. This strong comp was driven by growth in average ticket and in transactions. We saw more athletes purchase from us and they spent more each trip compared to the prior year. With growth in sales, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage, we achieved EBT margin of nearly 14% and EPS of $4.37, both significantly ahead of last year. At the heart of our strategies is our Omnichannel athlete experience. We're continuing to invest across our digital and store experiences to meet our athletes wherever they are, create confidence and excitement, and get product into their hands faster. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of House of Sport and our next generation 50, 000 square foot DICK'S locations, which internally we refer to as our fieldhouse concept. With House of Sport, we are redefining sports retail and creating very strong engagement with our athletes, our brand partners, and communities. It's also driving significant benefits to our real estate partners. We continue to hear from mall operators that our House of Sport locations drive increased traffic, sales per square foot, and occupancy rates for the malls where they operate. House of Sport is drawing unprecedented landlord interest and the opportunity to join many of the best shopping centers in the country. Later this month, we are excited to open our 15th House of Sport location and look forward to opening another five locations this year. We've also completely revolutionized our most typical format, our 50,000 square foot DICK\u2019S store into what we're calling our Field House concept. Field House is inspired by House of Sport and includes interactive experiences and elevated presentation and service. These stores are performing exceptionally well. During Q2, we opened four Field House locations and with 17 now open, we look forward to opening nine more locations this year. Investing in our digital capabilities is central to our Omni-channel athlete experience. This includes DICKS.com and our DICK'S mobile app, which continues to be key to our business and have strong engagement with our athletes. We continue to make the digital shopping experience better for our athletes and recently launched several features to help accelerate this journey, including elevated imagery, 3D viewing of select footwear, and AI-powered chat features. As we've talked about, we're also focused on digital innovation. With GameChanger, we've built a platform that engages with uSports families in a uniquely authentic way with the content most valuable to them, their kids sports games. Over 6 million unique users engage with GameChanger in Q2, an 11% increase from last year, averaging approximately 45 minutes per day in the app, speaking to the power of this content to sport families, coaches, and players. GameChanger allows us to connect with our athletes beyond the traditional shopping experience and reinforces our leadership in sport. Importantly, GameChanger families are some of DICK'S most valuable customers. A GameChanger customer who also has a DICK'S scorecard spends over two times more per year at DICK'S than a typical scorecard customer. The GameChanger business model generates predictable, recurring, high margin subscription revenue and during Q2, it drove continued robust sales growth. Providing differentiated on-trend product, which is our second strategic pillar, helps make DICK\u2019S the go-to-destination for sport in the US. We are excited about our assortment for the important back-to-school season and the product pipeline from our key brand partners and vertical brands. Our teammates are a critical driver of our success, and our third strategic priority is providing a best-in-class teammate experience. Our engagement surveys demonstrate that we are a fun and rewarding place to work. Our teammates are proud, personally committed, and optimistic about our future and we're seeing fantastic improvement in turnover across our stores. Lastly, we're continuing to invest in DICK'S brand building. We recently announced a new partnership with Team USA and LA28, designating DICK\u2019S as the official sporting goods retail provider. During the recent Olympic Games, we launched our latest marketing campaign that celebrates youth athletes and builds on our belief that sports have the power to change lives. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, including the strong results at House of Sport, our Field House Concept, and GameChanger. And we are highly confident in our strategies to drive sustained and profitable growth. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across this company for their outstanding efforts and continued commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our strong performance is a direct result of their efforts. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail.\nNavdeep Gupta : Thank you, Lauren, and good morning everyone. Before jumping into our Q2 results, I want to acknowledge the voluntary 8K we filed last week in which we disclosed that on August 21st we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our information systems. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that this incident is material. It did not disrupt our business. Our stores remained open, and our e-commerce sites were functioning throughout. Moving to our second quarter results, we are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.8% to $3.47 billion. This included a benefit from the calendar shift due to the 53rd-week last year of approximately $95 million or $0.30 in earnings per diluted share. Adjusting for the calendar shift, which we believe provides the clearest view of the business, our comps increased 4.5% as we continued to gain market share. Our strong comps were driven by a 3.5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in transactions. We saw strength across key categories, led by footwear and athletic apparel. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.28 billion, or 36.73% of net sales, and increased 231 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin of 169 basis points and leverage on occupancy costs, due to the higher sales. The increase in merchandise margin was driven by favorable sales mix and the quality of our assortment. It also included lower year-over-year shrink of 83 basis points, as we anniversary higher shrinks from 2023 that included an unfavorable true-up based on the physical inventories last year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 4.1% to $786.3 million and leveraged 78 basis points compared to last year due to the higher sales. The increase in SG&A dollars included higher incentive compensation expense, planned investment in marketing, and costs in support of our sales growth. Pre-opening expenses were $8.9 million, a decrease of $24 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by the timing of our new store opening. EBT in the second quarter was $482.3 million or 13.9% of net sales. This is up from EBT of $325.9 million or 10.1% of net sales in Q2 of 2023. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $4.37, an increase of 55% compared to the earnings per diluted share of $2.82 last year. As I mentioned earlier, this included a $0.30 earnings per diluted share benefit from the calendar shift. Now looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q2 with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. As a result of our consistent and strong financial performance and commitment to a healthy balance sheet, Moody's upgraded our credit ratings from Baa3 to Baa2 in early August. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 11% compared to Q2 of last year. This inventory investment has been a conscious decision to lean into differentiated key items and categories which are expected to drive our growth into the second half of 2024 and into early 2025. We believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned as we enter into Q3. Turning to our second quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $199 million and we paid $89 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 252,000 shares of our stock for $49.9 million at an average price of $198.05. Thus far this year, we have repurchased a total of $163.6 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect share repurchases of $300 million. Now moving to our outlook for 2024. As Lauren said, we are again raising our full year outlook. This reflects our strong Q2 performance and our confidence in our strategic initiatives and operational strength, balanced against the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to expect 2024 consolidated sales in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. We now expect full year comp sales growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% compared to our prior expectation of 2% to 3% growth. EBT margin is now expected to be at 11.2% at the midpoint compared to 11.1% previously. We now expect gross margins to expand year-over-year compared to our expectation for a modest expansion previously. Based on the strength of our business, we are making some strategic investments to drive long-term growth and we now expect SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis to de-leverage modestly year-over-year. For pre-opening expenses, we expect second half expenses to be moderately higher than the first half, driven by the timing and mix of our new store openings. The vast majority of this expense will fall into the third quarter. In total, we now anticipate full year earnings for diluted share to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.90 compared to our prior expectation of $13.35 to $13.75. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, keep in mind that due to the impact of shifted calendar, our reported total sales and EPS benefited by approximately $140 million are approximately $0.45 in earnings per diluted share in the first half. We expect an offsetting negative impact in the second half of the year. With the key back-to-school week shifting out of Q3 and into Q2 this year, the vast majority of this offset will happen in the third quarter. We estimate the unfavorable impact to Q3 reported total sales to be approximately $105 million or approximately $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Excluding the 53rd week last year, which added $170 million or $0.19 in earnings per diluted share, this shift will not impact our full year results. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the success of our long-term strategies. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and answer-session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Yih: Good morning. Let me add my congratulations. It is not often we see this kind of success at selling at full price in this landscape. So congrats. Lauren, I guess my first question is going to be pretty high level. I kind of want just you to go over again why DKS is having the success post-COVID, right, and what arguably is kind of a slowing athleisure or athletic environment? And can you go through -- you did it during the prepared remarks, but can you go through again kind of the top three things that DICK'S has done kind of pre-pandemic to post-pandemic and why you're kind of merging as the dominant player in the sporting goods landscape? Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Adrienne. We are -- I appreciate your congratulations, very, very pleased with the Q2 performance that we just put up, 4.5% comp. That was on top of a 2% comp last year, and we are driving market share gains. And I think that really speaks to the fact that our athletes, our consumer, we call athletes, are holding up very well. They continue to prioritize a healthy outdoor active lifestyle, they are prioritizing team sports. But I think, the reason we continue to gain market share is because our long-term strategies are working. So to your point about what's changed and it\u2019s even before COVID, over the past several years, we have been focused on several key strategic pillars. The first one is differentiated product. And our merchant teams have done an absolutely outstanding job, bringing in products that are high demand, that people are seeking, that teams are seeking, that all athletes are looking for. And that's a product that is both for a competitive performance athlete but also a lifestyle for that athlete or for that consumer. And so we now have an assortment that is truly differentiated in the marketplace and enables us to continue to drive sales and the healthy margins that you mentioned. Our athlete experience is another thing that we've been incredibly focused on, and that means a lot of things to us. That means both enhancing the service in our stores, making sure that we -- and on our website, making sure that we get product into people's hands sooner, making sure we get people the right product and it also speaks to the reinvention of our entire portfolio. We keep reinventing DICK'S Sporting Goods and that's something that's core to our values and our culture. But with House of Sport and the Field House, we continue to push what a reinvented model for serving athletes can look like, and those learnings continue to trade down -- trickle down through our entire company. Overall, I will just say we saw -- this past quarter, we saw growth across all income demographics, which was terrific. And we saw more athletes purchase from us, spending more per trip. So that's the increase in transactions and tickets. And we added 1.6 million athletes to our database in the quarter. So great quarter, but this has been a long-term strategy, multiple years, starting even pre-pandemic, and I'm very, very pleased with how the team has actually executed.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. And then a quick follow-up for Navdeep on the inventory. Obviously, you are building the inventory with a little bit higher, right than where we are on sales. Often, that's something that people look at. But can you just describe \u2013 there is a time in retail when you actually press on the accelerator and start to give that more gas to the inventory, and it's when you actually see the comps accelerating. So can you just talk about kind of giving the balance a little more oxygen to be able to taste those comps? And how you're derisking on the backside? Are you taking more upfront? Are you -- how you're managing that? Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Adrienne, thank you for that question. First of all, I think that you framed it really well, that this is us pouring a little bit more accelerant into our core strategies, what Lauren talked about, and she touched upon both of the most important facts on why the inventory investments we are making. First of all, it goes back to the access that we have, the work that our merchants have done in getting a differentiated product into our stores and on our website. This assortment is resonating so well. And so this is -- we see as a key area. And what I called out in my prepared remarks, as the key area of a conscious investment that we are making. The second thing that I would point to is our inventory is really clean and very well balanced. Our clearance inventory is meaningfully down compared to last year in Q2. And then the third thing is if you look deeper within -- into our updated guidance that we have provided, this goes back to the confidence that we have in our assortment. We raised our second half comp expectations modestly and actually raised our merch margin expectations also modestly in the second half. Again, coming back to the quality of assortment that we have, the access that we have to a very differentiated assortment. So we feel really good about the inventory and how well we are positioned for back-to-school season.\nLauren Hobart: Yes. And Adrienne, I would just add that the inventory that we've invested in is in things like key items and strike points and brands, and it has a long sale life. So we expect to have this inventory available and ready to sell into the spring and the Q1 of 2025. It is really good inventory.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Best of luck.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thanks Adrienne.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. I, too, would like to add my congratulations on another very nice quarter.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I have, I'll ask a high-level question and my follow-up would be more specific. But from a high-level perspective, look a lot of us follow closely your partners -- your vendor partners. And what we are hearing out there is this refocus, if you will on product innovation from Nike, Under Armour and many others. So the question I want to ask is look, DICK'S has been performing very, very well through a difficult macro backdrop, through a level of product innovation. Are you starting to see now from these vendors the product innovation accelerating? And to the extent you are, I mean, how much of an incremental tailwind for DICK'S will this be as it continues to take shape?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Brian. Absolutely, we are seeing our vendor partners focus on innovation. And we, ourselves as I mentioned earlier, are innovating our entire experience as well. With our strategic partners, we have really long-term sharing session, strategy sessions where we do look at the pipeline for years to come [Technical Difficulty].\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain on the line. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. And ladies and gentlemen, we will resume. Brian Nagel, your line is now live.\nLauren Hobart: Brian, I apologize. I heard your question, and I don't know whether you heard any of my answer. Our line dropped. So should I start over?\nBrian Nagel: You started to respond. So -- I mean, do you want me to repeat the question?\nLauren Hobart: Sure. Why don't we do that? Thank you very much.\nBrian Nagel: So look, my question was, what we are hearing from a number of your key vendor partners is that they are refocusing on post-pandemic, refocusing on product innovation. DICK'S has performed extraordinarily well through a tough macro backdrop and maybe while product innovation throughout the sector was lowing. So the question I have is, as you look -- I mean, a, are you starting to see some benefits of this product innovation from your vendor partners? And then b, how should we think about this refocusing on product innovation on the part of these vendor partners, as an incremental tailwind for DICK'S either through the balance of '24 into '25 or whatever?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Brian. Yes, we\u2019re excited about the product innovation cycle that we see coming down the pike with our vendor partners. And we have, as you would expect, long-term strategy meetings where we get peaks under the tent about what's coming. We're excited about the product innovation. But I would also point out, as I mentioned, to Adrienne's question, the innovation that we have in our own business in terms of how we are serving athletes the reinvented portfolio and the access that we have to highly differentiated products. So product, itself, is a key tailwind for us, has been for some time, and we continue to see that due to the access, due to innovation coming, we think it is a key pillar for us.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks Lauren, that's helpful. And then my second -- my follow-up question, I guess, maybe more for Navdeep. So you mentioned in your prepared comments, it sounds like incremental investments that you are going to undertake here in the second half of '24, which changes somewhat kind of the leverage profile of the business, at least near-term -- so I guess the question I'm asking is what are the -- maybe you can elaborate more on those investments?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Brian, just let me give a little bit of color to that. So if you look at it, we are investing in the core strategy. The strategies that Lauren articulated so well that are working so -- that are resonating with our athletes and are working so well. So things like repositioning our portfolio is, one. The technology investments that are allowing us to provide a very differentiated level of service to our athletes when they walk into our store or the technology investment that is making our website, so much more functional, those are the core areas of investment that we are leaning into to continue to position our business for 2025 and beyond in a very differentiated way. The other comment that I would add to that is the investment in our SG&A is balanced against the confidence that we have in our total margin expectation. So if you look deeper into our guidance, we have raised our total margin expectations for full year and invest -- and then net that against the SG&A investment. In totality, we actually have taken our operating margin expectations up by 10 basis points compared to our prior guidance.\nBrian Nagel: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, good morning everyone. Lauren, I wanted to start asking about the top-line and engagement on the customer side. The angle is this proliferation of some of the strongest brands, and I won't name them all, but there is a handful that are higher profile that are probably driving a good amount of growth, at least that's a perception. My question is, what are you paying attention to that gives you confidence that you are maintaining engagement with your customers on all of these brands? My perception is that some of these brands are starting to proliferate into other places. So how is that engagement changing as we see some of these brands and products end up in more places?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. Our engagement with our customers, we call athletes, is as high as it is ever been. And that's a credit to the experience that we have in the stores. It is also a credit to our brand campaign and what our marketing team has done. I know many of you have seen some of the work that came out during the Olympics. So we are top of mind awareness is great. But when you get into products, we are unique in our ability to provide both performance and lifestyle, head to toe. We know the output starts with the footwear for a kid, and we can output them for their entire outfit both every day in life and on the field as well. So we are excited about the differentiation that we have versus our competitors. We feel really good about the increased access that we have to products, and we also feel really good about our performance of our vertical brands. So in general, very optimistic about our continued growth.\nSimeon Gutman: A quick follow-up on House of Sport. Can you talk about the trajectory versus initial forecast and more so in -- post the 12-month period, so in the 12 to -- I think, I don't know what month we're at, 18th month or so, maybe closer to 24 in one or two cases. Anything that's surprising in terms of product categories or merchandise since -- versus your forecast?\nLauren Hobart: Yes. I mean we continue to be really pleased with how our House of Sports stores are performing. We did give comp guidance at the end of last year, that the two had been opened enough to have a comps positively. And the things that get us very excited about the House of Sport is both the fact that athletes are traveling further, they are visiting more frequently, they are increasing the dwell time, the amount of time that they spend in our stores. And in general, what we are seeing is that, that -- the ability to bring a brand to life is really helping us engage in some of that product innovation that you talked about just a moment ago. So we can bring a brand's life in our collaborative spaces, we call them our collab, in such an engaging way where we can talk about a brand story with some of our existing partners or bring in new brands to life. It really is -- it's been a fantastic way to get to know new brand partners and also to develop access with our current partners. And the last thing I would say that's just been increasingly noticeable is how much noise and excitement that we are making with the landlord and mall owner and our operator business. And the fact that when we open a House of Sport, we do see -- the mall owners are telling us that they see increased traffic, they see increased sales per square foot and occupancy rates. So that's actually giving us access to some of the best malls and the best shopping centers in the country and is a big part of our strategy.\nSimeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Well done, good luck.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you Simeon.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you Simeon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ohmes: Hi, good morning guys. Great quarter. My first question, and probably both of them are actually for Navdeep. Navdeep, can you talk about the House of Sport conversions and sort of how that might have benefited comps in the second quarter and how we should think about House of Sport conversions in the back half as a benefit to comps versus maybe what you saw in the first half? And then another modeling question, I'll just give you the two upfront, would just be for gross margin in the back half, if you could give us any thoughts on puts and takes for us to think about in 3Q versus 4Q, that would be great.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thanks, Robby. I appreciate your comment on the second quarter performance. So in terms of the conversion benefit for House of Sport, very consistent with what we had said at the end of last year. We had guided to the fact that our first half will benefit because as you recall, there were eight House of Sport conversions that we are doing last year that were all closed remodels. And so our first half of the comp of 2024 benefited from those closed remodels. And our expectation for the second half in the updated guidance that we have given is that our comps will be, again positive in the second half. However, we'll see a little bit of a takedown of the benefit that we saw in the first half. We continue to remain really confident about the House of Sport overall strategy. As Lauren just said in the prior question, the product access that we are having, the differentiated service that we are able to provide, how well that service and the product offering is resonating with our athletes that are traveling further, spending more time in the stores. Our store teams are doing a fantastic job of leveraging the assets that they have in store, including the field and engaging deeper with the community. And that is what is giving us the confidence that you see us taking the House of Sport learnings and translating that into the Field House concept that we talked this morning about. So hopefully, that answers your question in terms of the House of Sport in the first half versus the second half. Coming to the gross margin expectation, it is a great question because there are definitely some puts and takes as you look to the gross margin expectations for the second half. So let us start back to what we said at the end of last year. We said that our occupancy costs will be deleveraging this year, and that was contemplated in our original expectation. We still expect occupancy cost to deleverage on a full year basis. However, it will be -- the deleverage will be less now because of the elevated sales expectation that we have. The impact of Q3 shift of the important back-to-school sales shifting out of Q3 into Q2 to the tune of $105 million needs to be modern and appropriately when you are looking into the Q3 gross profit expectation. And likewise, keep in mind, in fourth quarter, we had the week 53 as well. So that additional week of $170 million of sales when you are modeling in the gross profit expectation for fourth quarter needs to be contemplated. In totality, what we have said is driven by the strong performance that we have driven in Q2, we have raised our total margin expectations for full year and also taken modestly up our merch margin expectations in second half, driven by the confidence that we have in our assortment.\nRobert Ohmes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Also a couple of questions. One, I remember DICK'S was all about the athlete and it wasn't really focused in the past as much on lifestyle. I get now that it's still all about the athlete. That's clear. But it seems like there's been a little bit more shift towards some lifestyle type products. Is that just in House of Sport? Or is that across the entire chain? Am I right in my perception that, that shifted a little bit? Any way to sort of frame that up a little bit, please?\nLauren Hobart: Mike, it is a great question. So we have always been rooted in sport, and we remain rooted in sport. We will always be about athletes and performance and getting people confident and excited about the product that they have that's going to increase their capabilities. What we didn't have access to before we started to invest in the premium full-service footwear, DICK'S, was the product that these kids want. These are athletes as well rooted in sport, but what they're wearing off the field, off the court as well. And it is just a part of their lifestyle, the lifestyle of an athlete. So now that we've invested in our premium full-service footwear DICK'S, you are correct in saying we have both -- we are rooted in sport. We still have incredible both -- footwear, apparel and gear for anybody who wants to compete at a high level. And in fact, that continues to improve, as we get access even in our footwear DICK'S, things like really elite soccer cleats and things like that. But -- in the same time, we now have access to the cool shoes, and that's important to the athlete when they come and they can get everything that they need.\nNavdeep Gupta: And Mike, let me build on that. This is much beyond just the House of Sport as well. As we have called out in the past, 90% of our chain now has a premium full-service footwear DICK'S experience. So the access that Lauren just talked about goes well beyond our House of Sport locations into our Field House. And actually, it goes into the almost large majority of our DICK'S Sporting Goods chain as well.\nMichael Baker: Got it. Makes sense. One follow-up and sort of a serious question, I'll say, how much did the [Celtics] (ph) helped in the quarter? You must have sold a ton of Celtics Care? I bought a lot. Did that help the comp at all? And I do ask, we did actually see a lot of stuff mark-down pretty quickly after the championship. I'm just wondering how that -- how the Celtics championship and that kind of licensed-product sales impacted the quarter?\nLauren Hobart: So we love the Celtics. We love all teams that are winning, but it wasn't material in the quarter. It's always great to have some \u2013 it is always great to have licensed hot, but it wasn't material.\nNavdeep Gupta: And then on to the markdown question, you will continue to see us being very decisive about the inventory that we have. We want to make sure that we have access as well as space available in store and online for the right product that can continue to drive this enthusiasm we are seeing from our athletes.\nMichael Baker: Awesome. Excellent. Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on a great quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thanks, John.\nJohn Kernan: Navdeep your supply chain has evolved quite a bit over the last several years. You're flowing through and setting inventory very high full price sell-through. I know you announced the -- another DC opening in Forth Worth. Can you talk about the supply chain going forward, your strategy within the entire omnichannel strategy? And any -- how does -- how do costs look for the supply chain going into the back half of the year?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. So we couldn't be more excited about the -- not just the supply chain team, but how well our merchandising team and our supply chain team and our inventory allocation team work closely together because it is all about making sure you have the right access, but then are able to flow that product in the most efficient way and in the quickest way possible, where if it is a product or if it's -- as we talked about the license product that needs to flow at a different speed through the network. And all these three teams work so well together. And the investment that we\u2019re making into the new DC is driven by the fact that if you look at our business compared to 2019, our business top-line is up significantly more than where it was in 2019. The SKU, the velocity of the SKU and the product access that we have is so differentiated. So we look at it and say that we need to make some fixed investments into our supply chain. And that's the plan to open the six DC in Dallas, which will open in early part of 2026. In terms of the second half expectation, there is nothing material to talk about the supply chain. It is running in-line with our expectation. The team is doing a fantastic job in kind of continuing to navigate the challenging landscape that we see, especially on the international freight side. But overall, really pleased with the partnership that exists and the work our supply chain team is doing.\nLauren Hobart: John, I just want to add a point to Navdeep's comments about our fulfillment for e-commerce and the fact that our stores have become a really critical part of our supply chain. We fulfill the vast majority of our eCommerce demand through our stores, and that gets us closer to the athletes, quicker delivery, lower cost. And so part of our supply chain, we are opening six DC to help service all of our stores, but our stores are also an incredible piece of our supply chain as well as being athlete serving.\nJohn Kernan: That's helpful thanks, and Navdeep, Lauren follow-up for you. It seems like some of the private owned brands like CALIA, VRST and DSG have gained square footage space inside the stores. How are those performing versus the chain? And what's the outlook for owned brands? Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you. We are very excited about how our vertical brands are performing across the board. In particular, I would point to DSG, VRST and CALIA. DSG, All three of them actually are filling a white space in our portfolio. DSG filling a fantastic whitespace for opening price point product that's very high function, high fashion and doing incredibly well. So you are seeing increased space across all of these vertical brands because they are performing so well and the commercial reacting. From a VRST standpoint, we just had a relaunch our limitless pant, which is really exciting and doing very well. And CALIA continues to do incredibly well, again meeting a need in a lifestyle to from the field and out -- or to the gym and outside and doing incredibly well. So we continue to grow both our strategic brands and our vertical brands. The whole portfolio is doing well.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nEric Cohen: This is Eric on for Chuck. I just wanted to ask about the incremental SG&A investments you're making. Are these just -- are you pulling forward investments from '25 into this year? Are these purely incremental now just from a position of strength? And how should we think about the timing of these investments in the back half of the year?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, I would say it's a combination of both things. We are seeing some pull forward opportunities from '25 into this year as well as some incremental investment opportunities to continue to position better for 2025 and beyond. In terms of the timing of these expenses, I\u2019d say, they would be ratably between Q3 and Q4. One of the things, as you're thinking about the modeling, I want you to keep in mind the preopening expenses in Q3. That will be an area of investment also when you look to the back half expectations.\nEric Cohen: Great. And then can you just provide any quantitatively how impactful the House of Sport was as you lap the temporary closings from last year and the conversions? And was there any benefit this quarter from the Olympics, the summer soccer tournaments? And just any commentary on Q3 to-date?\nNavdeep Gupta: Well, let's start with the last one because I think that's the easiest one. We won't provide the commentary. We are very excited about the key back-to-school season, and we\u2019re in the middle of the back-to-school season. So we'll provide more details about our Q3 commentary in late November. In terms of the Olympics, Olympics is a fantastic opportunity to continue to showcase the importance of sport and sport lifestyle in all athletes, whether it is the youth athletes or whether it is the adult athletes. So we see that more as an opportunity to showcase the importance of stores and active lifestyle in the communities. It necessarily does not have a significant impact to our comp sales performance that we saw here in Q2. In terms of the House of Sport conversion, we -- I wouldn't quantify that right now. But like we said, the first half benefited, but the benefit in Q2 was lower than in Q1, as you can imagine, because last year, we started to open some of these [we closed] (ph) remodels in the second quarter of last year.\nEric Cohen: Great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Will Gaertner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nWill Gaertner: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys just provide some more detail on what categories are driving the same-store momentum for you?\nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks, Will. With the 4.5% comp, we saw growth across many aspects of our business. We did see particular strength in footwear and apparel, and we saw some puts and takes within hardlines. But overall, just really pleased across the board.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. And just one more for me. Is one of the reasons why you are bringing in inventory earlier, are you seeing delays with Red Sea? Is that still an issue for you guys?\nNavdeep Gupta: Well, there is some aspect of it, but I won't call that as a material. We are working through kind of a dynamic supply chain environment that exists, but it's not a material driver of the inventory investment. Just a slight amount of timing difference between this year, Q2 and last year.\nLauren Hobart: Yes. We're not being inventory in earlier, so to speak, we're making strategic investments, cautious choices to invest in inventory so that we can meet athletes' demand.\nWill Gaertner: Understood, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Kleber with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJustin Kleber: Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Justin Kleber. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me was just curious how you are thinking about shrink over the back half of the year. It looks like this quarter, you effectively recaptured all of last year's cumulative true-up. So does your revised margin outlook assume shrink is a tailwind across the back half of the year?\nLauren Hobart: Yes, you are correct that we trued up shrink over last year when we had done inventories, and so you shouldn\u2019t expect it to be flat going forward into the second half.\nJustin Kleber: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then one other question just on the guidance. The comp guide was raised, but you held the total sales view. So is that just a function of fewer temp warehouse stores that are not in the comp base? Or is there something else going on there?\nNavdeep Gupta: No, it's a few of those puts and takes that happen. First of all, there is a little bit of a timing. There is a little bit in the non-comp sales, as well as you can imagine, there is a rounding factor as well when you are rounding to billions of the dollars. But yes, it is a combination of those three things.\nJustin Kleber: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks guys. And congrats on the quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Warren Cheng with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nWarren Cheng: Hi, good morning. I want to ask what's the limit on how much of the chain can eventually be upgraded to Field House locations? And are you accelerating the pace there? And one follow-up on that was just SG&A load per store, how does that compare to the base for the Field House location?\nLauren Hobart: Warren, there's no set limit on how many stores could be upgraded to Field House. We have a significant number of our stores that come up for renewal every year, and we'll continue to upgrade as it make sense, or we'll relocate as it makes sense and develop a Field House. But long term, that is the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods, and I will pass it to Navdeep for the SG&A question.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes. Warren, as you can expect, we are definitely making investments in elevated levels of service and experience in these stores. But keep in mind, what we shared last year that the Field House stored are -- have both a very strong top-line and a bottom-line profile with an EBITDA margin of 20% or slightly more. So we continue to be pleased in balancing the investments that we are making and the returns that we are driving.\nWarren Cheng: Got you. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, some of the new House of Sport locations are opening in a little bit smaller footprint than the original 120,000. Is there some convergence happening between those and the Field House locations? And what really makes the House of Sport differentiate from Field House kind of -- or what are the kind of defining characteristics that define House of Sport? Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Yes, it's a great question. Some of our first House of Sport locations were very large, well over 100,000 square feet. And we continue to iterate -- we can adapt to that model to any -- to 100,000 square feet, we can continue to adapt. When we look at a Field House concept, it is definitely leaning more toward our original 50,000 format. And while it has elevated presentation, elevated service, elevated product there are some of those interactive experiences like a rock climbing wall and tracking field and things like that, that we simply can't put into a Field House location. But I wouldn't say, there is a convergence except for in a positive way that the learnings from House of Sport continue to trickle to Field House and then to the entire rest of our chain.\nWarren Cheng: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks. This is Kelly on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. It looks like the 2H outlook assumed comps could have flattish to up 2. Just curious what your assumptions there on the low end versus the high end? And any differences we should take into account 3Q versus 4Q?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, the second half guidance is, I would say, if you've modeled it won't be flat. We are expecting positive comps in the second half, both in Q3 and Q4. The only thing that we -- between the difference between the high end of the range or the low end of the range is balancing the macroeconomic uncertainties that exist, as the consumer continues to be under pressure, and we are balancing our optimism and our confidence in our core strategy against the macroeconomic backdrop. Q3 and Q4, I would say, no significant differences. Back-to-school is an important season when we think of Q3 and then holiday continue to be such an important part of fourth quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And just a follow-up. I know you talked about some of these high-performing brands already, HOKA and ON specifically. I think you did roll out some more doors in 2Q. So any additional color on the door rollout, how they're performing on a like-for-like basis and if there's more opportunity to expand doors with these brands in F'25? Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Yes. There is more opportunity to expand both in HOKA and ON, and we'll be continuing to do that. And the brands are performing very well where we have them in same stores.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. So recognizing that you don't guide by quarter, DICK'S did outperform the consensus by $0.50 in the second quarter. You are raising the full year guide by $0.15 to $0.20. So how at all is your expectations internally for sales and profit change in the back half of the year?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Michael, maybe I'll start with the consensus part of the question because one thing that we had guided very clearly at the end of Q1, and hopefully more and more analysts will listen to what we say is the fact that we set the $100 million of important back-to-school week shifting out of Q3 into Q2. And what we told today was $95 million of benefit that was -- when you see the delta between the comp sales and the total sales, that $95 million was driven by the shift. And it benefited the second quarter by the tune of almost about $0.30. So that is one thing that I want to make sure that analysts, everybody's modeling that appropriately. What we did as far as the guidance is concerned, we have flown through the beat that we delivered here in second quarter, both in top-line, gross profit expectation as well as on the EPS on a full year basis. In addition to that, we modestly raised our second half comp expectation based on the confidence that we have in our product assortment and our core strategies. Keep in mind, again, as you are looking into Q3 on a year-over-year basis, you want to keep that $105 million of an unfavorable impact with the back-to-school beat now into Q2 impacting Q3. And we quantified that as well that it is about approximately $0.35 of unfavorable impact we will see in Q3.\nLauren Hobart: Yes. I want to just build on Navdeep's point because it is such an important point. So there was absolutely no deceleration in our back-half expectations. In fact, modest improvement in comps, as Navdeep mentioned. But there may be some confusion in terms of the impact from third quarter to second quarter and the 53rd week. So we would be happy to answer any questions after the call.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is given you have a core base of House of Sport up and running, what are you seeing from these locations in terms of their economics at influencing how you will proceed with the coming tranches of new models that you will be locating given that there should be 60 to 80 additional House of Sport locations over the next couple of years?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, Michael, I\u2019d say, that we continue to be really pleased with the performance that we are seeing out of the House of Sport locations. We have almost about -- we'll have 20 locations by the end of this year and the performance that we have seen in the first tranche of the stores that have already finished -- that are in the second year of the comp journey with us, these are -- those stores are still comping positively. The stores that we have opened last year and this year, they continue to meet our -- not only our financial expectations, more importantly our expectations from how well they are resonating in the communities that they are opening. So this is continuing to give us confidence into positioning our chain even further as we think about these opportunities. And we are pretty confident in the long-term outlook that we have given for House of Sport.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question, and that question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Lauren, Navdeep. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Michael's question. Given that you do have both formats sort of maturing here and some entering the comp base, any way to help frame how the range of profitability and sales are trending relative to the store targets you\u2019ve given, meaning is the range tight and giving you confidence that maybe those original store targets are conservative? Or any way to just help frame up how they're performing versus the pro forma plan?\nNavdeep Gupta: They are meeting right in-line with our pro forma expectations. Internally, we look at it from a financial return perspective. They are hurdling right at the level that we expect those to be. And that's the reason you are seeing us not only lean into the House of Sport strategy, but also lean in from a CapEx perspective where we are going and acquiring some of these locations because we feel this is a differentiated offering that we can offer to our athletes and also provide a very different level of service and experience to our brand partners and to the landlord. So we continue to be very confident in the capabilities, as well as the returns that we are seeing through the House of Sport stores. In terms of the long-term outlook -- yes. Let me just finish one more. In terms of the long-term outlook, we'll share that as we start to provide the more detailed outlook for 2025. However, what I can say is our focus internally and consistently with what we have said in the past is to drive both the sales and profitability for the long-term of the business. And that's where we will continue to be focused, as we look to the repositioning the portfolio, opportunity or the investments that we are making.\nSteven Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up on maybe the makeup of the second half implied comp guidance. Given the strength in comp average ticket, but also your comments right around engagement with your athletes, what should we expect to moderate in the back-half of the year? Is it more ticket moderation or transaction moderation? Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes, we don't provide the guidance at that level of detail. So I\u2019d say, Steven, at the aggregate level, we feel really confident about the core strategies and the core product offering that we have. We couldn't be more excited about the back-to-school season and the holiday season that is upon us. The range that you are seeing from a guidance perspective on a comp basis is primarily driven by the macroeconomic uncertainties that we just want -- that we wanted to be acknowledging as we provided the guidance today.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Lauren Hobart for closing comments.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you all for attending our call today and for your interest in DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods and to all of our teammates across the country and the world. Thank you so much for all you do to drive our results. Thanks, everybody. See you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, we delivered a very strong quarter. Our Q2 results continue to demonstrate how well our long-term strategies are working and the great execution of our team. Powered by our compelling omni-channel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, best-in-class teammate experience, and our ability to create deep engagement with the DICK'S brand, we are driving sustained top-line momentum and gaining market share. I am really proud of our team. Today we are again raising our full year outlook. This reflects our strong Q2 results and the confidence we have in our business. We now expect comp sales growth for the year to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% and EPS to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.90. Now moving to our results. For the second quarter, our sales increased 7.8% to just under $3.5 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 4.5%. This strong comp was driven by growth in average ticket and in transactions. We saw more athletes purchase from us and they spent more each trip compared to the prior year. With growth in sales, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage, we achieved EBT margin of nearly 14% and EPS of $4.37, both significantly ahead of last year. At the heart of our strategies is our Omnichannel athlete experience. We're continuing to invest across our digital and store experiences to meet our athletes wherever they are, create confidence and excitement, and get product into their hands faster. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of House of Sport and our next generation 50, 000 square foot DICK'S locations, which internally we refer to as our fieldhouse concept. With House of Sport, we are redefining sports retail and creating very strong engagement with our athletes, our brand partners, and communities. It's also driving significant benefits to our real estate partners. We continue to hear from mall operators that our House of Sport locations drive increased traffic, sales per square foot, and occupancy rates for the malls where they operate. House of Sport is drawing unprecedented landlord interest and the opportunity to join many of the best shopping centers in the country. Later this month, we are excited to open our 15th House of Sport location and look forward to opening another five locations this year. We've also completely revolutionized our most typical format, our 50,000 square foot DICK'S store into what we're calling our Field House concept. Field House is inspired by House of Sport and includes interactive experiences and elevated presentation and service. These stores are performing exceptionally well. During Q2, we opened four Field House locations and with 17 now open, we look forward to opening nine more locations this year. Investing in our digital capabilities is central to our Omni-channel athlete experience. This includes DICKS.com and our DICK'S mobile app, which continues to be key to our business and have strong engagement with our athletes. We continue to make the digital shopping experience better for our athletes and recently launched several features to help accelerate this journey, including elevated imagery, 3D viewing of select footwear, and AI-powered chat features. As we've talked about, we're also focused on digital innovation. With GameChanger, we've built a platform that engages with uSports families in a uniquely authentic way with the content most valuable to them, their kids sports games. Over 6 million unique users engage with GameChanger in Q2, an 11% increase from last year, averaging approximately 45 minutes per day in the app, speaking to the power of this content to sport families, coaches, and players. GameChanger allows us to connect with our athletes beyond the traditional shopping experience and reinforces our leadership in sport. Importantly, GameChanger families are some of DICK'S most valuable customers. A GameChanger customer who also has a DICK'S scorecard spends over two times more per year at DICK'S than a typical scorecard customer. The GameChanger business model generates predictable, recurring, high margin subscription revenue and during Q2, it drove continued robust sales growth. Providing differentiated on-trend product, which is our second strategic pillar, helps make DICK'S the go-to-destination for sport in the US. We are excited about our assortment for the important back-to-school season and the product pipeline from our key brand partners and vertical brands. Our teammates are a critical driver of our success, and our third strategic priority is providing a best-in-class teammate experience. Our engagement surveys demonstrate that we are a fun and rewarding place to work. Our teammates are proud, personally committed, and optimistic about our future and we're seeing fantastic improvement in turnover across our stores. Lastly, we're continuing to invest in DICK'S brand building. We recently announced a new partnership with Team USA and LA28, designating DICK'S as the official sporting goods retail provider. During the recent Olympic Games, we launched our latest marketing campaign that celebrates youth athletes and builds on our belief that sports have the power to change lives. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, including the strong results at House of Sport, our Field House Concept, and GameChanger. And we are highly confident in our strategies to drive sustained and profitable growth. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across this company for their outstanding efforts and continued commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods. Our strong performance is a direct result of their efforts. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Adrienne. We are -- I appreciate your congratulations, very, very pleased with the Q2 performance that we just put up, 4.5% comp. That was on top of a 2% comp last year, and we are driving market share gains. And I think that really speaks to the fact that our athletes, our consumer, we call athletes, are holding up very well. They continue to prioritize a healthy outdoor active lifestyle, they are prioritizing team sports. But I think, the reason we continue to gain market share is because our long-term strategies are working. So to your point about what's changed and it's even before COVID, over the past several years, we have been focused on several key strategic pillars. The first one is differentiated product. And our merchant teams have done an absolutely outstanding job, bringing in products that are high demand, that people are seeking, that teams are seeking, that all athletes are looking for. And that's a product that is both for a competitive performance athlete but also a lifestyle for that athlete or for that consumer. And so we now have an assortment that is truly differentiated in the marketplace and enables us to continue to drive sales and the healthy margins that you mentioned. Our athlete experience is another thing that we've been incredibly focused on, and that means a lot of things to us. That means both enhancing the service in our stores, making sure that we -- and on our website, making sure that we get product into people's hands sooner, making sure we get people the right product and it also speaks to the reinvention of our entire portfolio. We keep reinventing DICK'S Sporting Goods and that's something that's core to our values and our culture. But with House of Sport and the Field House, we continue to push what a reinvented model for serving athletes can look like, and those learnings continue to trade down -- trickle down through our entire company. Overall, I will just say we saw -- this past quarter, we saw growth across all income demographics, which was terrific. And we saw more athletes purchase from us, spending more per trip. So that's the increase in transactions and tickets. And we added 1.6 million athletes to our database in the quarter. So great quarter, but this has been a long-term strategy, multiple years, starting even pre-pandemic, and I'm very, very pleased with how the team has actually executed. Yes. And Adrienne, I would just add that the inventory that we've invested in is in things like key items and strike points and brands, and it has a long sale life. So we expect to have this inventory available and ready to sell into the spring and the Q1 of 2025. It is really good inventory. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Absolutely, we are seeing our vendor partners focus on innovation. And we, ourselves as I mentioned earlier, are innovating our entire experience as well. With our strategic partners, we have really long-term sharing session, strategy sessions where we do look at the pipeline for years to come [Technical Difficulty]. Brian, I apologize. I heard your question, and I don't know whether you heard any of my answer. Our line dropped. So should I start over? Sure. Why don't we do that? Thank you very much. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we're excited about the product innovation cycle that we see coming down the pike with our vendor partners. And we have, as you would expect, long-term strategy meetings where we get peaks under the tent about what's coming. We're excited about the product innovation. But I would also point out, as I mentioned, to Adrienne's question, the innovation that we have in our own business in terms of how we are serving athletes the reinvented portfolio and the access that we have to highly differentiated products. So product, itself, is a key tailwind for us, has been for some time, and we continue to see that due to the access, due to innovation coming, we think it is a key pillar for us. Thanks, Simeon. Our engagement with our customers, we call athletes, is as high as it is ever been. And that's a credit to the experience that we have in the stores. It is also a credit to our brand campaign and what our marketing team has done. I know many of you have seen some of the work that came out during the Olympics. So we are top of mind awareness is great. But when you get into products, we are unique in our ability to provide both performance and lifestyle, head to toe. We know the output starts with the footwear for a kid, and we can output them for their entire outfit both every day in life and on the field as well. So we are excited about the differentiation that we have versus our competitors. We feel really good about the increased access that we have to products, and we also feel really good about our performance of our vertical brands. So in general, very optimistic about our continued growth. Yes. I mean we continue to be really pleased with how our House of Sports stores are performing. We did give comp guidance at the end of last year, that the two had been opened enough to have a comps positively. And the things that get us very excited about the House of Sport is both the fact that athletes are traveling further, they are visiting more frequently, they are increasing the dwell time, the amount of time that they spend in our stores. And in general, what we are seeing is that, that -- the ability to bring a brand to life is really helping us engage in some of that product innovation that you talked about just a moment ago. So we can bring a brand's life in our collaborative spaces, we call them our collab, in such an engaging way where we can talk about a brand story with some of our existing partners or bring in new brands to life. It really is -- it's been a fantastic way to get to know new brand partners and also to develop access with our current partners. And the last thing I would say that's just been increasingly noticeable is how much noise and excitement that we are making with the landlord and mall owner and our operator business. And the fact that when we open a House of Sport, we do see -- the mall owners are telling us that they see increased traffic, they see increased sales per square foot and occupancy rates. So that's actually giving us access to some of the best malls and the best shopping centers in the country and is a big part of our strategy. Thank you Simeon. Mike, it is a great question. So we have always been rooted in sport, and we remain rooted in sport. We will always be about athletes and performance and getting people confident and excited about the product that they have that's going to increase their capabilities. What we didn't have access to before we started to invest in the premium full-service footwear, DICK'S, was the product that these kids want. These are athletes as well rooted in sport, but what they're wearing off the field, off the court as well. And it is just a part of their lifestyle, the lifestyle of an athlete. So now that we've invested in our premium full-service footwear DICK'S, you are correct in saying we have both -- we are rooted in sport. We still have incredible both -- footwear, apparel and gear for anybody who wants to compete at a high level. And in fact, that continues to improve, as we get access even in our footwear DICK'S, things like really elite soccer cleats and things like that. But -- in the same time, we now have access to the cool shoes, and that's important to the athlete when they come and they can get everything that they need. So we love the Celtics. We love all teams that are winning, but it wasn't material in the quarter. It's always great to have some \u2013 it is always great to have licensed hot, but it wasn't material. Thank you. John, I just want to add a point to Navdeep's comments about our fulfillment for e-commerce and the fact that our stores have become a really critical part of our supply chain. We fulfill the vast majority of our eCommerce demand through our stores, and that gets us closer to the athletes, quicker delivery, lower cost. And so part of our supply chain, we are opening six DC to help service all of our stores, but our stores are also an incredible piece of our supply chain as well as being athlete serving. Thank you. We are very excited about how our vertical brands are performing across the board. In particular, I would point to DSG, VRST and CALIA. DSG, All three of them actually are filling a white space in our portfolio. DSG filling a fantastic whitespace for opening price point product that's very high function, high fashion and doing incredibly well. So you are seeing increased space across all of these vertical brands because they are performing so well and the commercial reacting. From a VRST standpoint, we just had a relaunch our limitless pant, which is really exciting and doing very well. And CALIA continues to do incredibly well, again meeting a need in a lifestyle to from the field and out -- or to the gym and outside and doing incredibly well. So we continue to grow both our strategic brands and our vertical brands. The whole portfolio is doing well. Yes. Thanks, Will. With the 4.5% comp, we saw growth across many aspects of our business. We did see particular strength in footwear and apparel, and we saw some puts and takes within hardlines. But overall, just really pleased across the board. Yes. We're not being inventory in earlier, so to speak, we're making strategic investments, cautious choices to invest in inventory so that we can meet athletes' demand. Thank you. Yes, you are correct that we trued up shrink over last year when we had done inventories, and so you shouldn't expect it to be flat going forward into the second half. Thank you. Warren, there's no set limit on how many stores could be upgraded to Field House. We have a significant number of our stores that come up for renewal every year, and we'll continue to upgrade as it make sense, or we'll relocate as it makes sense and develop a Field House. But long term, that is the future of DICK'S Sporting Goods, and I will pass it to Navdeep for the SG&A question. Yes, it's a great question. Some of our first House of Sport locations were very large, well over 100,000 square feet. And we continue to iterate -- we can adapt to that model to any -- to 100,000 square feet, we can continue to adapt. When we look at a Field House concept, it is definitely leaning more toward our original 50,000 format. And while it has elevated presentation, elevated service, elevated product there are some of those interactive experiences like a rock climbing wall and tracking field and things like that, that we simply can't put into a Field House location. But I wouldn't say, there is a convergence except for in a positive way that the learnings from House of Sport continue to trickle to Field House and then to the entire rest of our chain. Thank you. Yes. There is more opportunity to expand both in HOKA and ON, and we'll be continuing to do that. And the brands are performing very well where we have them in same stores. Yes. I want to just build on Navdeep's point because it is such an important point. So there was absolutely no deceleration in our back-half expectations. In fact, modest improvement in comps, as Navdeep mentioned. But there may be some confusion in terms of the impact from third quarter to second quarter and the 53rd week. So we would be happy to answer any questions after the call. Thank you all for attending our call today and for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods and to all of our teammates across the country and the world. Thank you so much for all you do to drive our results. Thanks, everybody. See you next quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning everyone. Before jumping into our Q2 results, I want to acknowledge the voluntary 8K we filed last week in which we disclosed that on August 21st we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our information systems. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that this incident is material. It did not disrupt our business. Our stores remained open, and our e-commerce sites were functioning throughout. Moving to our second quarter results, we are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 7.8% to $3.47 billion. This included a benefit from the calendar shift due to the 53rd-week last year of approximately $95 million or $0.30 in earnings per diluted share. Adjusting for the calendar shift, which we believe provides the clearest view of the business, our comps increased 4.5% as we continued to gain market share. Our strong comps were driven by a 3.5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in transactions. We saw strength across key categories, led by footwear and athletic apparel. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.28 billion, or 36.73% of net sales, and increased 231 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin of 169 basis points and leverage on occupancy costs, due to the higher sales. The increase in merchandise margin was driven by favorable sales mix and the quality of our assortment. It also included lower year-over-year shrink of 83 basis points, as we anniversary higher shrinks from 2023 that included an unfavorable true-up based on the physical inventories last year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased 4.1% to $786.3 million and leveraged 78 basis points compared to last year due to the higher sales. The increase in SG&A dollars included higher incentive compensation expense, planned investment in marketing, and costs in support of our sales growth. Pre-opening expenses were $8.9 million, a decrease of $24 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by the timing of our new store opening. EBT in the second quarter was $482.3 million or 13.9% of net sales. This is up from EBT of $325.9 million or 10.1% of net sales in Q2 of 2023. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $4.37, an increase of 55% compared to the earnings per diluted share of $2.82 last year. As I mentioned earlier, this included a $0.30 earnings per diluted share benefit from the calendar shift. Now looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q2 with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. As a result of our consistent and strong financial performance and commitment to a healthy balance sheet, Moody's upgraded our credit ratings from Baa3 to Baa2 in early August. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 11% compared to Q2 of last year. This inventory investment has been a conscious decision to lean into differentiated key items and categories which are expected to drive our growth into the second half of 2024 and into early 2025. We believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned as we enter into Q3. Turning to our second quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $199 million and we paid $89 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 252,000 shares of our stock for $49.9 million at an average price of $198.05. Thus far this year, we have repurchased a total of $163.6 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect share repurchases of $300 million. Now moving to our outlook for 2024. As Lauren said, we are again raising our full year outlook. This reflects our strong Q2 performance and our confidence in our strategic initiatives and operational strength, balanced against the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to expect 2024 consolidated sales in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. We now expect full year comp sales growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% compared to our prior expectation of 2% to 3% growth. EBT margin is now expected to be at 11.2% at the midpoint compared to 11.1% previously. We now expect gross margins to expand year-over-year compared to our expectation for a modest expansion previously. Based on the strength of our business, we are making some strategic investments to drive long-term growth and we now expect SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis to de-leverage modestly year-over-year. For pre-opening expenses, we expect second half expenses to be moderately higher than the first half, driven by the timing and mix of our new store openings. The vast majority of this expense will fall into the third quarter. In total, we now anticipate full year earnings for diluted share to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.90 compared to our prior expectation of $13.35 to $13.75. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, keep in mind that due to the impact of shifted calendar, our reported total sales and EPS benefited by approximately $140 million are approximately $0.45 in earnings per diluted share in the first half. We expect an offsetting negative impact in the second half of the year. With the key back-to-school week shifting out of Q3 and into Q2 this year, the vast majority of this offset will happen in the third quarter. We estimate the unfavorable impact to Q3 reported total sales to be approximately $105 million or approximately $0.35 in earnings per diluted share. Excluding the 53rd week last year, which added $170 million or $0.19 in earnings per diluted share, this shift will not impact our full year results. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the success of our long-term strategies. We remain very enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Adrienne, thank you for that question. First of all, I think that you framed it really well, that this is us pouring a little bit more accelerant into our core strategies, what Lauren talked about, and she touched upon both of the most important facts on why the inventory investments we are making. First of all, it goes back to the access that we have, the work that our merchants have done in getting a differentiated product into our stores and on our website. This assortment is resonating so well. And so this is -- we see as a key area. And what I called out in my prepared remarks, as the key area of a conscious investment that we are making. The second thing that I would point to is our inventory is really clean and very well balanced. Our clearance inventory is meaningfully down compared to last year in Q2. And then the third thing is if you look deeper within -- into our updated guidance that we have provided, this goes back to the confidence that we have in our assortment. We raised our second half comp expectations modestly and actually raised our merch margin expectations also modestly in the second half. Again, coming back to the quality of assortment that we have, the access that we have to a very differentiated assortment. So we feel really good about the inventory and how well we are positioned for back-to-school season. Thanks Adrienne. Thanks, Brian. Yes, Brian, just let me give a little bit of color to that. So if you look at it, we are investing in the core strategy. The strategies that Lauren articulated so well that are working so -- that are resonating with our athletes and are working so well. So things like repositioning our portfolio is, one. The technology investments that are allowing us to provide a very differentiated level of service to our athletes when they walk into our store or the technology investment that is making our website, so much more functional, those are the core areas of investment that we are leaning into to continue to position our business for 2025 and beyond in a very differentiated way. The other comment that I would add to that is the investment in our SG&A is balanced against the confidence that we have in our total margin expectation. So if you look deeper into our guidance, we have raised our total margin expectations for full year and invest -- and then net that against the SG&A investment. In totality, we actually have taken our operating margin expectations up by 10 basis points compared to our prior guidance. Thank you Simeon. Thanks, Robby. I appreciate your comment on the second quarter performance. So in terms of the conversion benefit for House of Sport, very consistent with what we had said at the end of last year. We had guided to the fact that our first half will benefit because as you recall, there were eight House of Sport conversions that we are doing last year that were all closed remodels. And so our first half of the comp of 2024 benefited from those closed remodels. And our expectation for the second half in the updated guidance that we have given is that our comps will be, again positive in the second half. However, we'll see a little bit of a takedown of the benefit that we saw in the first half. We continue to remain really confident about the House of Sport overall strategy. As Lauren just said in the prior question, the product access that we are having, the differentiated service that we are able to provide, how well that service and the product offering is resonating with our athletes that are traveling further, spending more time in the stores. Our store teams are doing a fantastic job of leveraging the assets that they have in store, including the field and engaging deeper with the community. And that is what is giving us the confidence that you see us taking the House of Sport learnings and translating that into the Field House concept that we talked this morning about. So hopefully, that answers your question in terms of the House of Sport in the first half versus the second half. Coming to the gross margin expectation, it is a great question because there are definitely some puts and takes as you look to the gross margin expectations for the second half. So let us start back to what we said at the end of last year. We said that our occupancy costs will be deleveraging this year, and that was contemplated in our original expectation. We still expect occupancy cost to deleverage on a full year basis. However, it will be -- the deleverage will be less now because of the elevated sales expectation that we have. The impact of Q3 shift of the important back-to-school sales shifting out of Q3 into Q2 to the tune of $105 million needs to be modern and appropriately when you are looking into the Q3 gross profit expectation. And likewise, keep in mind, in fourth quarter, we had the week 53 as well. So that additional week of $170 million of sales when you are modeling in the gross profit expectation for fourth quarter needs to be contemplated. In totality, what we have said is driven by the strong performance that we have driven in Q2, we have raised our total margin expectations for full year and also taken modestly up our merch margin expectations in second half, driven by the confidence that we have in our assortment. And Mike, let me build on that. This is much beyond just the House of Sport as well. As we have called out in the past, 90% of our chain now has a premium full-service footwear DICK'S experience. So the access that Lauren just talked about goes well beyond our House of Sport locations into our Field House. And actually, it goes into the almost large majority of our DICK'S Sporting Goods chain as well. And then on to the markdown question, you will continue to see us being very decisive about the inventory that we have. We want to make sure that we have access as well as space available in store and online for the right product that can continue to drive this enthusiasm we are seeing from our athletes. Thank you. Thanks, John. Yes. So we couldn't be more excited about the -- not just the supply chain team, but how well our merchandising team and our supply chain team and our inventory allocation team work closely together because it is all about making sure you have the right access, but then are able to flow that product in the most efficient way and in the quickest way possible, where if it is a product or if it's -- as we talked about the license product that needs to flow at a different speed through the network. And all these three teams work so well together. And the investment that we're making into the new DC is driven by the fact that if you look at our business compared to 2019, our business top-line is up significantly more than where it was in 2019. The SKU, the velocity of the SKU and the product access that we have is so differentiated. So we look at it and say that we need to make some fixed investments into our supply chain. And that's the plan to open the six DC in Dallas, which will open in early part of 2026. In terms of the second half expectation, there is nothing material to talk about the supply chain. It is running in-line with our expectation. The team is doing a fantastic job in kind of continuing to navigate the challenging landscape that we see, especially on the international freight side. But overall, really pleased with the partnership that exists and the work our supply chain team is doing. Yes, I would say it's a combination of both things. We are seeing some pull forward opportunities from '25 into this year as well as some incremental investment opportunities to continue to position better for 2025 and beyond. In terms of the timing of these expenses, I'd say, they would be ratably between Q3 and Q4. One of the things, as you're thinking about the modeling, I want you to keep in mind the preopening expenses in Q3. That will be an area of investment also when you look to the back half expectations. Well, let's start with the last one because I think that's the easiest one. We won't provide the commentary. We are very excited about the key back-to-school season, and we're in the middle of the back-to-school season. So we'll provide more details about our Q3 commentary in late November. In terms of the Olympics, Olympics is a fantastic opportunity to continue to showcase the importance of sport and sport lifestyle in all athletes, whether it is the youth athletes or whether it is the adult athletes. So we see that more as an opportunity to showcase the importance of stores and active lifestyle in the communities. It necessarily does not have a significant impact to our comp sales performance that we saw here in Q2. In terms of the House of Sport conversion, we -- I wouldn't quantify that right now. But like we said, the first half benefited, but the benefit in Q2 was lower than in Q1, as you can imagine, because last year, we started to open some of these [we closed] (ph) remodels in the second quarter of last year. Well, there is some aspect of it, but I won't call that as a material. We are working through kind of a dynamic supply chain environment that exists, but it's not a material driver of the inventory investment. Just a slight amount of timing difference between this year, Q2 and last year. No, it's a few of those puts and takes that happen. First of all, there is a little bit of a timing. There is a little bit in the non-comp sales, as well as you can imagine, there is a rounding factor as well when you are rounding to billions of the dollars. But yes, it is a combination of those three things. Thank you. Yes. Warren, as you can expect, we are definitely making investments in elevated levels of service and experience in these stores. But keep in mind, what we shared last year that the Field House stored are -- have both a very strong top-line and a bottom-line profile with an EBITDA margin of 20% or slightly more. So we continue to be pleased in balancing the investments that we are making and the returns that we are driving. Thank you. Yes, the second half guidance is, I would say, if you've modeled it won't be flat. We are expecting positive comps in the second half, both in Q3 and Q4. The only thing that we -- between the difference between the high end of the range or the low end of the range is balancing the macroeconomic uncertainties that exist, as the consumer continues to be under pressure, and we are balancing our optimism and our confidence in our core strategy against the macroeconomic backdrop. Q3 and Q4, I would say, no significant differences. Back-to-school is an important season when we think of Q3 and then holiday continue to be such an important part of fourth quarter. Yes, Michael, maybe I'll start with the consensus part of the question because one thing that we had guided very clearly at the end of Q1, and hopefully more and more analysts will listen to what we say is the fact that we set the $100 million of important back-to-school week shifting out of Q3 into Q2. And what we told today was $95 million of benefit that was -- when you see the delta between the comp sales and the total sales, that $95 million was driven by the shift. And it benefited the second quarter by the tune of almost about $0.30. So that is one thing that I want to make sure that analysts, everybody's modeling that appropriately. What we did as far as the guidance is concerned, we have flown through the beat that we delivered here in second quarter, both in top-line, gross profit expectation as well as on the EPS on a full year basis. In addition to that, we modestly raised our second half comp expectation based on the confidence that we have in our product assortment and our core strategies. Keep in mind, again, as you are looking into Q3 on a year-over-year basis, you want to keep that $105 million of an unfavorable impact with the back-to-school beat now into Q2 impacting Q3. And we quantified that as well that it is about approximately $0.35 of unfavorable impact we will see in Q3. Yes, Michael, I'd say, that we continue to be really pleased with the performance that we are seeing out of the House of Sport locations. We have almost about -- we'll have 20 locations by the end of this year and the performance that we have seen in the first tranche of the stores that have already finished -- that are in the second year of the comp journey with us, these are -- those stores are still comping positively. The stores that we have opened last year and this year, they continue to meet our -- not only our financial expectations, more importantly our expectations from how well they are resonating in the communities that they are opening. So this is continuing to give us confidence into positioning our chain even further as we think about these opportunities. And we are pretty confident in the long-term outlook that we have given for House of Sport. Thank you. They are meeting right in-line with our pro forma expectations. Internally, we look at it from a financial return perspective. They are hurdling right at the level that we expect those to be. And that's the reason you are seeing us not only lean into the House of Sport strategy, but also lean in from a CapEx perspective where we are going and acquiring some of these locations because we feel this is a differentiated offering that we can offer to our athletes and also provide a very different level of service and experience to our brand partners and to the landlord. So we continue to be very confident in the capabilities, as well as the returns that we are seeing through the House of Sport stores. In terms of the long-term outlook -- yes. Let me just finish one more. In terms of the long-term outlook, we'll share that as we start to provide the more detailed outlook for 2025. However, what I can say is our focus internally and consistently with what we have said in the past is to drive both the sales and profitability for the long-term of the business. And that's where we will continue to be focused, as we look to the repositioning the portfolio, opportunity or the investments that we are making. Yes, we don't provide the guidance at that level of detail. So I'd say, Steven, at the aggregate level, we feel really confident about the core strategies and the core product offering that we have. We couldn't be more excited about the back-to-school season and the holiday season that is upon us. The range that you are seeing from a guidance perspective on a comp basis is primarily driven by the macroeconomic uncertainties that we just want -- that we wanted to be acknowledging as we provided the guidance today."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nate Gilch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nNate Gilch: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2024 results. On today's call will be Lauren Hobart, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Navdeep Gupta, our Chief Financial Officer. A playback of today's call will be archived on our Investor Relations website located at investors.dicks.com for approximately 12 months. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as cautionary statements made during this call. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our Investor Relations website to find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call. And finally, a few admin items. First, as we previewed on our last earnings call, beginning this quarter, we have revised our comparable sales calculations to include revenue from our GameChanger business. Second, beginning this quarter, we've included grand opening advertising costs within preopening expenses. These one-time costs incurred in connection with opening new stores were historically presented within SG&A, part of advertising costs. We have reclassified prior period amounts informed to our current year presentation. And finally, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our second quarter 2024 earnings results on September 4th, 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Lauren.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We're incredibly proud of our strong Q1 results which demonstrate how well our strategies are working. Powered by our compelling omnichannel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, deep engagement with the DICK'S brand and our focus on providing a best-in-class teammate experience, we continued our momentum from the fourth quarter. Our execution on these strategic pillars is driving continued market share gains. For the first quarter, our sales increased 6.2% to just over $3 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 5.3%, which was on top of a 3.6% comp last year. This strong comp was driven by growth in transactions and in average ticket. During the quarter, we saw more athletes purchase from us and they spent more each trip compared to the prior year. Our first quarter gross margin expanded 10 basis points and we achieved double-digit EBT margin of over 11%. In total, we delivered Q1 EPS of $3.30. Today, we're raising our full year outlook to reflect our strong Q1 results. We now expect comp sales growth for the year to be in the range of 2% to 3% and EPS to be in the range of $13.35 to $13.75. Our emphasis on the omnichannel athlete experience is driving robust athlete engagement. We are continuing to enhance service levels across all our digital and store experiences to meet our athletes wherever they are, provide the support and service they need, and get product into their hands faster. During Q1, we continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes, our strongest athletes, who spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. As we've talked about previously, our significant investments to reposition our portfolio are key to delivering an elevated omnichannel athlete experience. We expect House of Sport and our next generation 50,000 square foot DICK's store to drive robust omnichannel athlete engagement and generate strong sales and profitability. During Q1, we opened two House of Sport locations and are excited to open six additional locations this year. We also opened two next-generation 50K locations during the first quarter and look forward to opening an additional 14 locations throughout 2024. We continue to be very pleased with the results of these exciting DICK's concepts. This one-two punch of House of Sport and our next-generation 50K format combined with the elevated omnichannel experience our teammates are bringing to life throughout our entire portfolio is the future of DICK's. We're also growing our Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels, and opened three new locations during the first quarter. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in golf and are excited to bring this experience to more golfers. Investing in our digital capabilities is central to our omnichannel success. I want to briefly talk about GameChanger, the premier live streaming, scheduling, communications and scorekeeping mobile app where we're building the first and best place to experience youth sports. During Q1, GameChanger drove continued strong sales growth. Over 5 million unique users engaged with GameChanger averaging approximately 30 minutes per day on the app. We saw a robust increase in usage of the app across all sports, including those that are newer to the GameChanger platform such as basketball, football, soccer and volleyball. We're excited to continue innovating within the fast-growing, multi-billion dollar youth sports technology market and strengthening our relationships with athletes and their families through GameChanger. Our access to differentiated on-trend product, which is our second strategic pillar, helps make DICK's the go-to destination for sport in the US. We're excited about the product pipeline from our key brand partners. For example, Nike's recent Paris Innovation Summit highlighted several breakthrough products across apparel and footwear that we look forward to bringing to our athletes. Our relationships with our brand partners are stronger than ever and the innovation of performance and style, in our opinion, has never been better. In addition, our flagship vertical brands DSG, CALIA and VRST, are resonating very well with our athletes. They continue to outpace the total company comp growth and contribute greater margin expansion. We see a long runway for sales and profitability growth for our vertical brands. Our teammates are a critical driver of our success and our third strategic priority is providing a best-in-class teammate experience. This past quarter, we were named a great place to work for the fourth year in a row. We remain focused on providing our teammates with the tools and technology to help them do their jobs better and driving a culture where they can develop and thrive. Lastly, we're creating deeper brand engagement. During the first quarter, we invested in several exciting marketing campaigns and also continued to invest in DICK's brand building during March Madness. We're excited to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of our foundation Sports Matter Program and recently announced that the program is giving $2 million in grants to mark its anniversary and empower even more young athletes to pursue their passions. In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our first quarter performance and are highly confident in our strategy to drive sustained, profitable growth. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across the company for their tremendous efforts and continued commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods. It's their passion and hard work that make these results possible. They are truly an outstanding team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 6.2% to $3.02 billion. This included a benefit from the calendar shift due to 53rd week last year of approximately $45 million. Adjusting for the calendar shift which we believe provides the clearest view of the business. Our comps increased 5.3% as we continued to gain market share. Our strong comps were on top of a 3.6% comp last year. Our Q1 comps were driven by a 2.7% increase in transactions and a 2.6% increase in average ticket, and we saw strength across footwear, athletic apparel and hardline. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, or 36.29% of net sales and increased 10 basis points from last year. This included leverage on occupancy costs due to higher sales and a decline in merchandise margin of 45 basis points which included higher year-over-year shrink of 22 basis points. It's worth noting that while we anticipated our shrink to be higher than the previous year, the increase in shrink moderated compared to our expectations. On a non-GAAP basis, as expected, SG&A expenses increased 6.6% to $739.7 million and deleveraged 10 basis points compared to last year. This increase in SG&A dollars included investments in the exciting brand campaigns we introduced earlier this year supporting CALIA, DSG as well as Golf Galaxy and DICKS.com. This also included higher estimated incentive compensation expense and cost in support of our sales growth. Pre-opening expenses were $21.1 million, an increase of $11.9 million compared to the prior year. This expected increase was primarily driven by our Q1 House of Sport openings. As Nate noted earlier, SG&A and pre-opening expenses have been adjusted in the current and prior years to reflect the reclassification of grand opening advertising from SG&A to pre-opening expenses. EBT was $342.4 million, or 11.34% of net sales. This compares to EBT of $328.3 million, or 11.55% of net sales in Q1 of 2023. As expected, our Q1 tax rate grew from 7.2% in last year's quarter to 19.6% this year. I'll remind you that this approximate 1,200 basis points increase reflects the higher tax deduction from the vesting of employee equity awards and exercises in the prior year, which favorably impacted Q1 2023 earnings by approximately $0.45 compared to the current year quarter. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $3.30. This compares to earnings per diluted share of $3.40 last year. Now, looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q1 with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 5.5% compared to Q1 of last year, slightly below our 6.2% increase in sales. We believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned. Turning to our first quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $126 million and we paid $94 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 548,000 shares of our stock for $113.6 million at an average price of $207.32. In 2024, we continue to expect share repurchases of $300 million. Now, turning to our outlook for 2024. As a result of our strong Q1 performance, our expectations for continued robust demand from athletes and the confidence we have in our business, we are raising our full-year outlook. We now expect consolidated sales in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. In addition, we now expect comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3% compared to our prior expectation of 1% to 2% growth. EBT margin is now planned to be at 11.1% at the midpoint compared to 10.9% previously. Gross margin is now expected to expand modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results. We previously expected gross margins to be in-line with 2023 non-GAAP results at approximately 35%. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to leverage modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results. In total, we now anticipate full-year earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.35 to $13.75 compared to our prior expectations of $12.85 to $13.25. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23% compared to our prior expectation of approximately 24%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, as you model 2024, I want to point out a couple of things that we expect to impact comparability of our financial results for the second quarter. First, recall that due to the shifted calendar, we expect our reported total sales to be positively impacted in the first half with an offset in second half. Specifically, given the impact of the shift on a key back-to-school week, we expect our reported total sales in Q2 to be positively impacted by approximately $100 million versus the prior year with an offset in Q3. Second, we will begin to anniversary the higher shrink rates from 2023 in the upcoming second quarter. As a reminder, our shrink in Q2 of last year also included a cumulative unfavorable true-up of actual results from our physical inventories, which reflected an 84 basis points increase over 2022. Consequently, we expect to see year-over-year favorability in shrink during this year's second quarter. In closing, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a great start to the year. Lauren, we were lucky enough to see House of Sport in Boston during the quarter. And I guess my question for you is kind of more longer term. The notion or the philosophy was that you wanted to create a store such that people wouldn't need to go to another store other than House of Sport or the DICK's next-gen. So to the extent that you see kind of going forward, how do you see the Sporting Goods landscape kind of panning out? And then my kind of main question is the investment in training, education, service, and then advertising, it's a level-up of anything that we're seeing currently in the retail landscape. So can you talk about kind of the investments that you're making there and how that's going to differentiate your concepts versus the rest of retail? Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Great. Thanks, Adrienne. Yeah. We were delighted to have you and a group of people in Boston. We've had a ton of people coming through the House of Sport there, and the excitement in that community has been absolutely just incredible to see. I think the thing about House of Sport that is truly redefining sports retail is that we are creating an experience that people cannot get anywhere else. And what you're seeing is athletes are really responding to it, so communities are responding to it. I don't know how -- some of you texted that you saw the blimp going by. Like, there's just so much fanfare and excitement when we open a House of Sport. But then as it's open, athletes are coming in, they're driving further, they're spending more time, they're really excited about the product and the experience that they see at House of Sport. Secondly, the brand partners that we have are also very excited because we can bring a brand to life throughout our entire company in a really elevated way. But in House of Sport, because we have collab spaces and other opportunities to truly bring a brand to life, we can showcase a brand in the best possible way and that's helping us drive both new partnerships as well as more access and excitement with our current brand partners. And then the last thing I would point out that I think is important to note is that if you look at real estate developers and landlords and mall developers, when a House of Sport opens in a mall, we are seeing significant increases in traffic to the mall. And so there's a lot of excitement in the marketplace there as well. Across the board, we're just super excited about House of Sport and equally excited about our new 50K square foot format, which is a takedown of the House of Sport, but provides many of the same elements. You asked about investments. I'll turn it to Navdeep to talk a little bit about SG&A, but the SG&A expenses in Q1 were as planned and we invested in marketing. We will continue to invest to build our brand long-term. We invested in training and service and tech tools to drive the athlete experience that our teammates need to be able to deliver. Anything you would add Navdeep?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, no. Good morning, Adrienne. And just building on what Lauren said, the focus continues to be, as Lauren said, it's around the core four pillars. And two of those pillars that we talk a lot about is about the athlete experience and the teammate experience. And the work that our store team, as well as, the merchandising team are doing in bringing innovative and very differentiated product to our stores and the store team, the work that they're doing in providing this experience and kind of the fit experience that we are able to provide to our athletes when they walk into the store, whether it's a baseball bat, whether it's a golf club, that we feel is the -- is kind of our differentiator as we see not only within our own industry players, but quite frankly against some of the specialty players that are in the marketplace as well. So that will be a key area for our investments. And like Lauren indicated, we showcase that with the investments in advertising, including our vertical brands and how differentiated they are as part of Q1. But we expect these investments to continue to be balanced against the sales growth that we are delivering here as well.\nAdrienne Yih: Thank you very much. It's definitely showing up in the stores. Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about sell through of seasonal merchandise spring and summer as the seasons are transitioning, and in the context of merch margin being down a little this quarter. Can you also share with us, was merch margin or is merch margin plan to be flat within the overall gross margin guidance, or is the gross margin being elevated by occupancy? Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Simeon. Yeah, for the quarter, we were really pleased with our gross margin expanded 10 basis points, 36.29%. There were a ton of puts and takes to the quarter as we expected there would be, well, and an unexpected good surprise with the sales numbers that enabled us to drive more leverage on occupancy costs, more leverage on supply chain and e-commerce costs. All of that were -- was slightly offset by a 45 basis point decline in merch margin, but that we had anticipated driven primarily because of the shrink, the fact that we're not anniversarying yet, the shrink reserves that we put into place, and we'll start anniversarying those in Q2. I think it's important to note that our -- one of our core merchandising strategies and one of our core sales-driving strategies is to keep our inventory clean and fresh. We are constantly moving product through the lifecycle so that when people come into our stores or shop online, they're getting a completely differentiated assortment and they are finding the products that are appealing to them. And so, as expected, merch margin was slightly declined in Q1. But for the full year, we are now expecting gross margin to expand modestly, whereas before we had said it was going to be flat.\nSimeon Gutman: That's helpful.\nNavdeep Gupta: And Simeon, we are expecting --\nSimeon Gutman: I want to ask --\nNavdeep Gupta: Simeon, I'll just add one more thing to what Lauren said. The merch margin I would say in Q1 was in line with our expectations and we expect merch margin to also expand modestly on a year-over-year basis in '24 compared to non-GAAP 2023 results.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then follow-up, Navdeep, the full year EBIT or the implied EBIT or EBT, whatever way you look at it, looks like it's being raised above and beyond what was achieved or beat versus the street number in Q1. The comp, I think, looks like it's more of a flow-through from what happened in Q1. So is that fair and what is changing in terms of profit to raise the back half while sales is kind of moving up by what happened in Q1?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, Simeon, that's a great question. First of all, let me start by saying we were really excited by the results that we delivered here in Q1 and we continue to remain really excited about the future and the opportunities that we see ahead of us. As you can imagine, this is just Q1. We have very early in the year as well as everybody knows what else is happening on a macro-factor basis. So what we have done today in terms of the full-year guidance is it reflects the results that we posted here in Q1 and we maintained largely our expectations for Q2 through Q4. There's a little bit of a disconnect with the external consensus expectation, but I would say, we are appropriately cautious as we think about Q2 through Q4. But we continue to remain really excited about the opportunities that we see for the balance of the year.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good results. Take care.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I believe when you last guided same-store sales of 1% to 2%, that was mainly based on your assumption of market share gains. With the new comp guide of 2% to 3% today, is there any better view on the health of the industry within that or is it still primarily driven by market share?\nLauren Hobart: Kate, we are excited to raise the comp guidance from 1% to 2% to 2% to 3% for the balance of year. As Navdeep just mentioned, the large part of that is flowing through the results that we just had in Q1 so that we do maintain an appropriate level of caution as we go. We obviously do plan on continuing to gain market share. That's one of our -- it's one of our key strategies and we think we have the experience and the product to be able to do that.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And then our second question, with the change in accounting for GameChanger and some of your earlier comments in the prepared comments about GameChanger, is there a meaningful strategy change there in terms of how much that can drive the business and what is kind of the long-term goal and strategy with GameChanger?\nLauren Hobart: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are so excited about GameChanger and excited in the fact that it is such an amazing emotive platform through which people can engage with their kids' sports, with their grandkids' sports, and kids can track their stats and see how they're doing and where they're performing. So you're hearing the excitement because we've been investing in this digital platform. It's a leading youth sports app. It's got incredible capabilities and it keeps driving meaningful success. So 5 million active users on the platform in Q1, on average, spending 30 minutes per day on GameChanger. It's an incredible engagement tool. So the way I look at it, the way we look at it, is that it's a key part of our long-term strategy to become synonymous with sports. It's part of our entire ecosystem. You're seeing -- we're trying to account for it in comps, it's a relatively negligible part of that equation right now, but we believe it is a big part of our future.\nNavdeep Gupta: Kate, I'll add two more points to that, to what Lauren said. First of all, the platform itself is a very high growth, both on a sales basis as well as on a -- and as a very profitable platform. So by itself, the business itself is fantastic. The other thing that we have talked about is the fact that the athletes that are both GameChanger user and the ScoreCard user have 2x the revenue profile of just a ScoreCard user. So that indicates also that the level of engagement that we have with these multi-channel athletes is actually really, really exciting and interesting to us as we look to the long-term opportunity with this platform.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. So my first question is just a follow-up on the merchandise margin. Can you talk about what after the first quarter being down, can you talk about what the drivers of what makes it go up over the year? And within that answer maybe address is it channel inventory is clearing up? We've heard about maybe some of the vendors being promotional. Is the newness coming? Is it the House of Sports? Maybe help us think about what the big drivers are there? Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, Chris, I'll start with the full-year outlook that we provided. So we expect both the gross margin and the merge margin to expand modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results we posted last year. The ingredients within that, if you think about Q1 results, we have already declared what there are a couple of points we shared today around the Q2 expectation that you need to be thinking about as you model this. The first and foremost is we had an 84 basis points of accumulative true-up in shrink last year when we did the physical inventories in that stores. And so we don't anticipate having that same impact this year. So there will be favorability that we expect in shrink results in Q2. And we continue to be appropriately cautious for the balance of the year just on the shrink line itself. And in addition, as you would remind -- you would recall that we were cleaning up some of the inventory in the outdoor space last year in Q2. So we don't anticipate annualizing those actions either because where we have exited Q1 this year, we feel really great about the -- our inventory and the quality of the inventory and most importantly, the assortment that we have available for going into the kind of the key selling season here in Q2. So excited about the assortment and how clean that assortment is. So we expect that action again will not be annualized as we look to Q2.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then in my, as a follow-up question, just can you touch a little bit on how you think about the cadence of comps over the year? I know you don't drive speak specifically to by quarter, but how should we think about that? I know there was some lift in the first quarter here with regards to lapping the closed stores, the House of Sports stores. And I think the general consensus maybe was around two points. So any comments on that and how you think about the cadence of comps over the year? Thanks so much.\nLauren Hobart: Yeah, Chris, you're absolutely right. We said originally, and we still hold that the first half of the year, where we had eight of our largest stores being converted to House of Sports and closed for a good part of the first half of last year is driving stronger comps in Q1. Now, we just obviously delivered a stronger comp than we had even expected. But in the first half we do, we will feel that impact, and then in the second half, we'll go up against that those openings. And so that is why we've said the deceleration. We expect some deceleration in the back half and nothing has changed in that opinion. We continue to believe that.\nChristopher Horvers: Great. Thanks so much.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRobert Ohmes: Hey, good morning. Great quarter. My first question is just, Lauren, you guys have been leading with apparel and footwear for a little while now. Any signs or expectations that hardlines could start to catch up and grow again for you guys?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robby. Yes. What's really great about the quarter we just had with the 5.3% comp is we saw growth across all aspects of our business. So we saw growth in footwear, we saw growth in athletic apparel, we saw growth in total hardlines. Obviously, there's some puts and takes in there. And we've been talking about some of those -- some of the consumer trends that are right sizing from the pandemic. But that's a very small piece of our business. And the core hardline categories are doing very well. This past quarter, we had a slightly wetter season, impacted the game of golf and team sports a little bit, but nominally so. And in general, we're very, very excited about the hardlines business.\nRobert Ohmes: Got it. And then you guys called out Nike and the Paris Summit in the press release, can you give a little more color on what you think the pipeline looks like from Nike and your other key vendors versus what you were getting last year heading into the year?\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Robby. Yes, I would say we're excited about the product pipeline that we see across our strategic partners and we look long-term, obviously, we have long-term strategy planning meetings where we're looking at a couple of years with our strategic partners. I'm also very excited, as we all are, about our flagship vertical brands, the CALIA, DSG, VRST, doing incredibly well and some of our emerging brands. Within our strategic partners, we are very excited about the long-term work that we saw in Nike. We were there at the innovation summit and then more recently we were in their offices and looking at future innovation. I would call out things like the technology that they are bringing to the air platform. It's going to be very exciting from a consumer standpoint. We're really excited about the elevation of both performance apparel and footwear and bringing some newness into those categories. And then they've started to talk about what their Olympic messaging is going to be and we are really, really excited to see that come to market and just drive consumer noise around the Nike brand. So across the board, very excited about that partnership.\nRobert Ohmes: Sounds great. Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Warren Cheng from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nWarren Cheng: Hey, good morning. Congrats on a really solid quarter and a tough environment here. I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about SG&A investment here and whether that's evolving given the really strong response you're getting to the elevated service levels at House of Sport and the next-gen stores. Could the core benefit from kind of a higher level of SG&A and selling personnel? And maybe just if you could take a minute and talk about how you're thinking about SG&A in the medium term here.\nNavdeep Gupta: So Warren, first of all, let's start with where the SG&A came in. So SG&A deleveraged 10 basis points here in Q1 and that was driven by the core investments that we are making is including in advertising. So because we see clearly an opportunity to continue to position, especially at flagship vertical brands in a much more appropriate fashion with our athletes because those brands, like Lauren said, are resonating so well. So you saw us come out with advertising message around CALIA around DSG as well as drove the brand awareness for our dotcom platform with DICKS.com. So that will be an area that we said we were going to invest in Q1 and the early part of the year, and we did that. And then on a full-year basis what we have guided is we expect our SG&A to modestly leverage on a year-over-year basis. So we are being prudent in how we are making investment. You called out we are making investments in talent, in technology, as well as in the store service level, especially as you look to the House of Sport as well as the 50K. And those are kind of the planned investments that we are making in addition to investments that we are making in store training. So we will continue to look to make these core investments that are driving the differentiation in the marketplace and are resonating really well with the athletes. However, balancing that also against the overall ability to drive the leverage on the SG&A line for the full year.\nWarren Cheng: Thanks, Navdeep. And my follow-up question, can you help us put the $35 million per box number that you gave last quarter in a little bit more context? Once you're fully rolled out to the 75 to 100 target over the next three years, would that represent sort of one of the larger and more productive stores in the chain? Because I know the new House of Sports have a lot of different shapes and sizes or is that pretty representative of the average that you would expect across the fully scaled-out chain?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. So the $35 million that we shared last quarter, that's kind of our expectation for an average House of Sport on an omni basis. That includes both the store as well as the e-comm business. And we have rolled out 12 stores based -- this is based off of the learning informed by those 12 stores that we have opened at the end of 2023 and we continue to be really excited with the two store openings that we have done here in Q1.\nLauren Hobart: I would point out also that the 50K's continue to deliver incredibly strong results. And the House of Sport, the ones that have been opened the longest, also keep driving growth. So we're really excited, not just about how they open, but how they grow past that.\nWarren Cheng: Thanks. Nice quarter. Good luck.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMichael Baker: Okay, thanks. Sort of been asked, but maybe ask it another way. The -- so the EBT -- the implied EBT margin for the rest of the year is up, I think after it was down this quarter. Now it seems like a lot of that is because of cycling the second quarter declines from last year. So I guess the question is this, how should we think about the potential to increase your margins in the back half of the year and then beyond this year, the margins, at least according to your guidance, will be up, I think, 30 basis points on the EBT line this year. Well, what are the long-term margin drivers? Should margins once we cycle the easy comparison in the second quarter, do margins keep going up?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, Mike, great question. I won't provide quarterly guidance today, but what we have given to you are some of the key ingredients. On a full-year basis, we expect our EBT margin to expand driven by the fact that we expect gross margin to expand modestly as well as our SG&A to leverage modestly compared to non-GAAP results for 2023. You called out really well that the drivers of that will be definitely here in Q2. Keep in mind, Q2 will also have the higher amount of leverage being driven by the $100 million of sales shift that we're going to see from Q3 into Q2. In terms of the long-term expectation, we continue to be really, call it, excited about both the ability to grow our top-line sales as well as the bottom-line profitability over the long-term.\nMichael Baker: Okay, that makes sense. Follow-up question. How much of the $11 million increase in pre-opening costs went to pay Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish to show up at your opening, which was amazing.\nNavdeep Gupta: Those are, I'll call them, they're right investments. They're like Lauren said, they are driving such an excitement in the community and the overall results that we are driving here in these stores. But great question.\nLauren Hobart: Great question.\nMichael Baker: Thank you. It was cool.\nLauren Hobart: Good.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nJoseph Feldman: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. And wanted to ask a bit about the promotional environment and what you're seeing out there. And, because, it feels like inventory levels are still a bit high from a lot of the competition and some of the brands. And I'm just curious about how you're approaching it and what you're seeing. Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Thanks, Joe. We didn't see an unusually promotional environment in Q1. Certainly the industry overall is in a better place than it was at the end of last year. And our inventory, in particular, 5.5% growth on a 6.2% total comp. We feel really good about our inventory and the healthiness of it. And so I think we continue to manage through whatever promotional environment will come our way, but we have no concerns there and we know that we have the ability to manage with the tools that we have to drive profits.\nJoseph Feldman: Thank you for that. And then another kind of related question is some of the categories that were asked about, but how is outdoor broadly performing? Because I know, again, we hear it's kind of still soft out there and just wondering if you guys saw a step up in your outdoor performance.\nLauren Hobart: Yeah. Joe, I want to point out, in the long-term, we have a tremendous confidence in the outdoor business. It's a $40 billion TAM. We are building public lands. We're working to moose draw, athletes to bring, explorers rather to bring them in, so that we can really deliver a unique and differentiated experience in the outdoor category. Across the board, the industry does continue to have a post-pandemic reset and we're no different in that than everybody else. But it doesn't take away. It's a small piece of our business, first of all, at this time, and doesn't take away from our confidence, our long-term confidence, that there is a consumer here that we can serve even better than they're being served today. And participation in the outdoor category continues to be high. So when this category rebounds, it's going to, we believe it's going to be really strong.\nJoseph Feldman: That's great. Now, thank you guys for that, and good luck with the quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nJohn Kernan: Can you talk to footwear. Footwear has been a big driver of comps going back to last year. I know the premium footwear decks have obviously attracted top allocations from Nike, HOKA, ON. How many more doors can HOKA and ON get into? How many more premium footwear decks can there be? And maybe just talk the allocations you're getting at footwear, given it's such a big portion of the comp?\nLauren Hobart: Yeah, great question. Footwear certainly has been a big driver of comps and footwear is a key part of how people shop. It's the engine that drives the train. We're very pleased with our footwear business. Our premium full-service footwear decks, which we started putting into place many years ago, absolutely are driving that elevated experience and then opening us up for more allocations, more specialty brand partners with HOKA and ON and with the premium footwear decks, we'll be at 90% by the end of the year. And obviously, all of our new store development, as we reimagine the portfolio, will have premium full service footwear decks. HOKA and ON are still in a good portion of the chain. There's still significant upside in both brands. HOKA is a little further ahead, been on at this point just in terms of the number of door count, and we're excited to continue to expand those brands as well.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. And then maybe we saw some more sluggish trends within the broader sporting goods industry in the first quarter that you obviously significantly outperformed. I'm just curious are there any regions that are outperforming? What were the biggest category outperformers in Q1? And how are you thinking about long-term market share in the industry?\nLauren Hobart: Yeah. We had 5.3% comp. We saw growth. We didn't see sluggish trends across our categories. We saw growth across all of the different areas of our business, footwear, apparel, total hardlines, all grew. And I think what we can speak to our story, the consumer is absolutely putting a priority on a healthy and active lifestyle. You see people running and walking, being outdoors. But I think the most important thing is that we are providing them with an experience that they're clearly choosing. And that's both due to the products that we have in our stores as well as the experience that we provide in-store and online. And so it's the core strategies that are coming to life that are driving our performance and we're not seeing any pockets of softness across the country.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Kleber from Baird. Your line is open.\nJustin Kleber: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. First just a clarification on the full-year merch margin outlook. Is the modest expansion just recapturing the shrink pressure from last year or you're expecting your, I guess what I would call your core merch margins to improve year-over-year, particularly, Navdeep, you mentioned lapping the outdoor clearance. So just wanted to clarify that first.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah. So from a shrink perspective, we said that we will be having favorable impact in Q2 and then we continue to be appropriately cautious. We have counted half of the chain and still half of the chain needs to be counted. So as you can imagine, we want to be cautious in our expectation for shrink. And on the merch margin side, we continue to be really enthusiastic about the work that our merchant team is doing in terms of the differentiated product assortment we are bringing, the work that we are doing and how well our flagship vertical brands are performing between CALIA, DSG, VRST. And so we continue to be -- I won't break down merch margin expectations deeper than that, but we expect to grow our margins, both the gross margins and merch margin, on a year-over-year basis modestly as we look to the full year.\nJustin Kleber: Got it. Okay, thank you. Just one other question around the calendar shift. Curious if you could share the EPS benefit in 1Q. I assume those sales flow through at a much higher incremental margin. But, again, just any color on how that $45 million in 1Q impacted earnings. And then just so we can think about the list in 2Q related to the $100 million in the calendar shift benefit. Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, I would say, as you can imagine, it's $45 million. So you can appropriately do a flow-through calculation on that. And this is -- this -- the shift is happening in the early part of the year or -- so you can appropriately adjust your margin expectation in the SG&A. I would say, net between the Q2 and Q3, the impact would be neutral. It's just that Q2 is going to get a favorable impact with $100 million of sales within approximately the same amount of an offsetting impact in Q3.\nJustin Kleber: All right. Thank you and congrats on the quarter.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Civello from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJoseph Civello: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask another question about the cost cadence this year. In 2Q, obviously, you're going to be lapping a ton of clearance in the outdoor from last year. Should we think about recovering all of that or most of that or do you give any guidance there?\nNavdeep Gupta: No, I don't know, if I'll give any more specific guidance on a quarterly basis, but as you can imagine, in addition to kind of the lapping of the clearance activity that you called out, we will be favorable against the shrink true up that we had almost about 84 basis points of an unfavorable impact that we saw in Q2. I would look at it on a full year basis. We -- like we said, we expect our merch margin to expand on a year-over-year basis as well as the gross margins.\nJoseph Civello: Okay, great. And then just one more question. I think said shrink came in a little bit better than you were expecting. How should we think about that in the second half as you are lapping normalized shrink from last year?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, absolutely. Great question. So, like, shrink, like, it deleveraged 22 basis points here in Q1. It did -- it's -- the shrink is still going up on a year-over-year basis. I want to be clear about it. So that's where we continue to be appropriately cautious as we look to Q3 and Q4 impact on the P&L basis. However, like you said, it did moderate versus our internal expectation, which is a good news trend. But we have only counted half of our chain. So we'll continue to be appropriately cautious as we look to the balance of the year on shrink line. I would give a lot of credit to --\nJoseph Civello: All right. Thank you so much.\nNavdeep Gupta: I'll give a little bit of a shout-out to our store team and the DC team, the work that they're doing in -- not just in continuing to move the merchandise, make appropriate operating decisions to keep the stores and our athletes safe. That is allowing us to have a slightly, call it, moderated growth on a year-over-year basis versus our internal expectations.\nJoseph Civello: Got it. Thanks so much.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nCharles Grom: Hey, good morning. Really great quarter. My question's on traffic. The past three quarters have been really, really strong, particularly on a two-year basis. Curious if there's a way to unpack new customers versus existing customers.\nLauren Hobart: So we've continued to grow our athlete base over the past several years. I think we had 7 million new athletes joined last year and 1.5 million this past quarter. And traffic has continued to be strong. So it's about new athletes. It's also just about the differentiated product that we keep bringing in and the fact that the elevation of the brand and the experience has been strong. So really, really good traffic numbers and our consumers holding up very, very well.\nCharles Grom: Okay, great. And then my follow-up is just on GameChanger. I'm curious how you're thinking about growing that business for kids and youth sports. There's just a big appetite right to watch your kids, there's a ton of different platforms out there, but it seems like you guys are taking the pole position here. Just so curious how you're thinking about growing it over time.\nLauren Hobart: Yeah, great question. And we have the same vision you have. It is the best platform. And really, we started off GameChanger. It was a Diamond Sports focused business. And so while we continue to improve, we're using artificial intelligence to get the video even more exciting and accurate. And there's lots going on behind the scenes there to drive even more excitement there. Our biggest thing in the short term is to grow the Diamond Sports business into other emerging -- they're not emerging sports, but they're emerging to the platform, things like volleyball and other sports, and basketball is a big priority. So that's how we're going to be growing near term. But our vision is big here and we are thinking long-term and how we can continue to develop that connection with our athletes, not just when they're in the store, but when they're at their practice, at their games, and beyond during training.\nCharles Grom: Great. Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about stores versus e-comm in terms of what you're seeing transactions versus ticket within both channels. And I'm curious if you could share anything further about what you see in the e-comm business in the trade area of a House of Sports store when it opens and as they mature. Thanks.\nLauren Hobart: Yeah. Paul, thanks for the question. We don't -- we no longer break out stores in an e-comm, and that's because inherently, the customer is so omnichannel and focused that it became a very challenging exercise. But we're very pleased with our digital business and very pleased with how the e-commerce business responds when we open new stores and when a House of Sport comes in the area. It's all a very positive ecosystem story.\nPaul Lejuez: Okay. Then just a follow-up. Did anything change in terms of how you're thinking about category performance as you move throughout the year just based on what you saw in Q1, maybe relative to your prior expectations, just how each category is contributing to this year's growth.\nLauren Hobart: Now, overall, the categories are delivering on our expectations above them in Q1 and nothing material changed.\nPaul Lejuez: Thank you.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Gaertner from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nWill Gaertner: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just firstly, where are you guys and who are you guys taking share from in your opinion?\nLauren Hobart: Yeah, so it's a quick question. Yes, we're taking share, really across the board. There's been some consolidation in the industry. We are taking share from, I don't want to call out anybody specifically, but we have our premium footwear assortment, for example, is driving strong interest. Our apparel is driving strong interest. Our vertical brands are meeting consumer needs, even everything from opening price point to true lifestyle. So I would say it's across the board and across the industry that we're seeing share gains.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. Thank you. As far as GameChanger, it looks like it added 20 basis points to the comp, excuse me, last year.\nLauren Hobart: Correct.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yes.\nWill Gaertner: How do we think about GameChanger as far as revenue going forward? I mean is -- I think you call that $100 million revenue in 4Q, is that -- is there any seasonal way puts and takes there? I mean how do we think about GameChanger and how much is going to add to the comp going forward?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, you said both of the facts really well. Yes, the favorable, the impact was -- the favorable impact to comp was about 20 basis points. And we expect that on a full-year basis. It will range between 20 basis points to 30 basis points. And our full year expectation from the GameChanger platform is to deliver about $100 million of sales yet in 2024.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. Thank you.\nNavdeep Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is just on SG&A. Following the business optimization actions you took last year, where are you with reinvesting there? Are you still on track to reinvest in the focus areas that you planned and any other color you have on the SG&A outlook?\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, no, we are definitely focused on investing in appropriate capabilities and quite frankly, we have been doing this all along 2023 itself. The big area of investments continue to be in talent, right, bringing the right talent that is helping us do these store openings have the successful openings not just of the House of Sport, but the 50K. There is a lot of investment, as you can imagine, that is going in technology area, which as you can imagine, that is allowing us to get the top-line returns from those investments. And it's also helping us drive productivity improvements, which we are then able to reinvest that into the business. And then the third area continues to be investment appropriately within the advertising line, driving the brand awareness as well as the growth in our vertical brands.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And so, going forward beyond 2024, SG&A leverage is going to be predominantly dependent on top-line growth. That's a fair statement?\nNavdeep Gupta: That's generally a fair statement, but I would say again, we -- on a long-term basis, we expect both to drive top-line growth as well as the bottom-line profitability improvement. It will be balanced between the margin investment opportunity or the SG&A investment opportunities.\nSeth Basham: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Nice results and thanks for taking my questions. The first one was on ticket. If you could give us just more color on what fueled the ticket growth this quarter looks better than the industry and prepared remarks indicate more spend per trip. So any more color there would be helpful and kind of understanding what's embedded in that revised comp guide for 2024 regarding ticket whether the 50-50 split from 1Q is reasonable. Thanks.\nNavdeep Gupta: Yeah, Jonathan, I would say the answer to the first question is the same, right? The -- what is driving increased basket size when the athletes come to our store as well as the overall ticket continues to be driven by the differentiated product that we have access to. This is the product that is highly coveted, highly in demand right now. So having that product allows you to not only capture the demand that is walking into the store or online, but you are able to get a much better recovery on that full-price selling as well. So the premium assortment and the premium product as well as the most allocated and sought-after product continues to drive both the -- our ticket size as well as the basket size when the athletes come. And in terms of the guidance, we don't provide the guidance at that level. So I'll continue to keep the comp guidance of 2% to 3% for the full year at the highest level. And we continue to be really excited about the balance trend that we are driving between the traffic growth as well as the ticket growth.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the transactions this quarter. Did you see any discernible shift in trends across income cohorts?\nLauren Hobart: We didn't. We saw growth across all of our income demographics and we didn't see trade down from best to better, better to good. So pretty consistent across all the income demographics or cohorts.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Thanks so much.\nLauren Hobart: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Lauren Hobart, for some closing remarks.\nLauren Hobart: Well, thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And I just want to take a moment to thank our incredible team in our CSC, our DCs, our stores, our GameChanger offices. It is they who delivered this really strong quarter. I'm very, very thankful and proud of them. Thank you all. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lauren Hobart",
            "content": "Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We're incredibly proud of our strong Q1 results which demonstrate how well our strategies are working. Powered by our compelling omnichannel athlete experience, differentiated product assortment, deep engagement with the DICK'S brand and our focus on providing a best-in-class teammate experience, we continued our momentum from the fourth quarter. Our execution on these strategic pillars is driving continued market share gains. For the first quarter, our sales increased 6.2% to just over $3 billion. Adjusting for the calendar shift, our comps increased 5.3%, which was on top of a 3.6% comp last year. This strong comp was driven by growth in transactions and in average ticket. During the quarter, we saw more athletes purchase from us and they spent more each trip compared to the prior year. Our first quarter gross margin expanded 10 basis points and we achieved double-digit EBT margin of over 11%. In total, we delivered Q1 EPS of $3.30. Today, we're raising our full year outlook to reflect our strong Q1 results. We now expect comp sales growth for the year to be in the range of 2% to 3% and EPS to be in the range of $13.35 to $13.75. Our emphasis on the omnichannel athlete experience is driving robust athlete engagement. We are continuing to enhance service levels across all our digital and store experiences to meet our athletes wherever they are, provide the support and service they need, and get product into their hands faster. During Q1, we continue to see growth in our omnichannel athletes, our strongest athletes, who spend more with us and shop more frequently than single-channel athletes. As we've talked about previously, our significant investments to reposition our portfolio are key to delivering an elevated omnichannel athlete experience. We expect House of Sport and our next generation 50,000 square foot DICK's store to drive robust omnichannel athlete engagement and generate strong sales and profitability. During Q1, we opened two House of Sport locations and are excited to open six additional locations this year. We also opened two next-generation 50K locations during the first quarter and look forward to opening an additional 14 locations throughout 2024. We continue to be very pleased with the results of these exciting DICK's concepts. This one-two punch of House of Sport and our next-generation 50K format combined with the elevated omnichannel experience our teammates are bringing to life throughout our entire portfolio is the future of DICK's. We're also growing our Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, an immersive experience for golf enthusiasts of all levels, and opened three new locations during the first quarter. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in golf and are excited to bring this experience to more golfers. Investing in our digital capabilities is central to our omnichannel success. I want to briefly talk about GameChanger, the premier live streaming, scheduling, communications and scorekeeping mobile app where we're building the first and best place to experience youth sports. During Q1, GameChanger drove continued strong sales growth. Over 5 million unique users engaged with GameChanger averaging approximately 30 minutes per day on the app. We saw a robust increase in usage of the app across all sports, including those that are newer to the GameChanger platform such as basketball, football, soccer and volleyball. We're excited to continue innovating within the fast-growing, multi-billion dollar youth sports technology market and strengthening our relationships with athletes and their families through GameChanger. Our access to differentiated on-trend product, which is our second strategic pillar, helps make DICK's the go-to destination for sport in the US. We're excited about the product pipeline from our key brand partners. For example, Nike's recent Paris Innovation Summit highlighted several breakthrough products across apparel and footwear that we look forward to bringing to our athletes. Our relationships with our brand partners are stronger than ever and the innovation of performance and style, in our opinion, has never been better. In addition, our flagship vertical brands DSG, CALIA and VRST, are resonating very well with our athletes. They continue to outpace the total company comp growth and contribute greater margin expansion. We see a long runway for sales and profitability growth for our vertical brands. Our teammates are a critical driver of our success and our third strategic priority is providing a best-in-class teammate experience. This past quarter, we were named a great place to work for the fourth year in a row. We remain focused on providing our teammates with the tools and technology to help them do their jobs better and driving a culture where they can develop and thrive. Lastly, we're creating deeper brand engagement. During the first quarter, we invested in several exciting marketing campaigns and also continued to invest in DICK's brand building during March Madness. We're excited to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of our foundation Sports Matter Program and recently announced that the program is giving $2 million in grants to mark its anniversary and empower even more young athletes to pursue their passions. In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our first quarter performance and are highly confident in our strategy to drive sustained, profitable growth. Before concluding, I'd like to thank all of our teammates across the company for their tremendous efforts and continued commitment to DICK'S Sporting Goods. It's their passion and hard work that make these results possible. They are truly an outstanding team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Navdeep to share our financial results in more detail. Great. Thanks, Adrienne. Yeah. We were delighted to have you and a group of people in Boston. We've had a ton of people coming through the House of Sport there, and the excitement in that community has been absolutely just incredible to see. I think the thing about House of Sport that is truly redefining sports retail is that we are creating an experience that people cannot get anywhere else. And what you're seeing is athletes are really responding to it, so communities are responding to it. I don't know how -- some of you texted that you saw the blimp going by. Like, there's just so much fanfare and excitement when we open a House of Sport. But then as it's open, athletes are coming in, they're driving further, they're spending more time, they're really excited about the product and the experience that they see at House of Sport. Secondly, the brand partners that we have are also very excited because we can bring a brand to life throughout our entire company in a really elevated way. But in House of Sport, because we have collab spaces and other opportunities to truly bring a brand to life, we can showcase a brand in the best possible way and that's helping us drive both new partnerships as well as more access and excitement with our current brand partners. And then the last thing I would point out that I think is important to note is that if you look at real estate developers and landlords and mall developers, when a House of Sport opens in a mall, we are seeing significant increases in traffic to the mall. And so there's a lot of excitement in the marketplace there as well. Across the board, we're just super excited about House of Sport and equally excited about our new 50K square foot format, which is a takedown of the House of Sport, but provides many of the same elements. You asked about investments. I'll turn it to Navdeep to talk a little bit about SG&A, but the SG&A expenses in Q1 were as planned and we invested in marketing. We will continue to invest to build our brand long-term. We invested in training and service and tech tools to drive the athlete experience that our teammates need to be able to deliver. Anything you would add Navdeep? Thank you. Thanks, Simeon. Yeah, for the quarter, we were really pleased with our gross margin expanded 10 basis points, 36.29%. There were a ton of puts and takes to the quarter as we expected there would be, well, and an unexpected good surprise with the sales numbers that enabled us to drive more leverage on occupancy costs, more leverage on supply chain and e-commerce costs. All of that were -- was slightly offset by a 45 basis point decline in merch margin, but that we had anticipated driven primarily because of the shrink, the fact that we're not anniversarying yet, the shrink reserves that we put into place, and we'll start anniversarying those in Q2. I think it's important to note that our -- one of our core merchandising strategies and one of our core sales-driving strategies is to keep our inventory clean and fresh. We are constantly moving product through the lifecycle so that when people come into our stores or shop online, they're getting a completely differentiated assortment and they are finding the products that are appealing to them. And so, as expected, merch margin was slightly declined in Q1. But for the full year, we are now expecting gross margin to expand modestly, whereas before we had said it was going to be flat. Kate, we are excited to raise the comp guidance from 1% to 2% to 2% to 3% for the balance of year. As Navdeep just mentioned, the large part of that is flowing through the results that we just had in Q1 so that we do maintain an appropriate level of caution as we go. We obviously do plan on continuing to gain market share. That's one of our -- it's one of our key strategies and we think we have the experience and the product to be able to do that. Yes. Thanks for the question. We are so excited about GameChanger and excited in the fact that it is such an amazing emotive platform through which people can engage with their kids' sports, with their grandkids' sports, and kids can track their stats and see how they're doing and where they're performing. So you're hearing the excitement because we've been investing in this digital platform. It's a leading youth sports app. It's got incredible capabilities and it keeps driving meaningful success. So 5 million active users on the platform in Q1, on average, spending 30 minutes per day on GameChanger. It's an incredible engagement tool. So the way I look at it, the way we look at it, is that it's a key part of our long-term strategy to become synonymous with sports. It's part of our entire ecosystem. You're seeing -- we're trying to account for it in comps, it's a relatively negligible part of that equation right now, but we believe it is a big part of our future. Thank you. Yeah, Chris, you're absolutely right. We said originally, and we still hold that the first half of the year, where we had eight of our largest stores being converted to House of Sports and closed for a good part of the first half of last year is driving stronger comps in Q1. Now, we just obviously delivered a stronger comp than we had even expected. But in the first half we do, we will feel that impact, and then in the second half, we'll go up against that those openings. And so that is why we've said the deceleration. We expect some deceleration in the back half and nothing has changed in that opinion. We continue to believe that. Thank you. Thanks, Robby. Yes. What's really great about the quarter we just had with the 5.3% comp is we saw growth across all aspects of our business. So we saw growth in footwear, we saw growth in athletic apparel, we saw growth in total hardlines. Obviously, there's some puts and takes in there. And we've been talking about some of those -- some of the consumer trends that are right sizing from the pandemic. But that's a very small piece of our business. And the core hardline categories are doing very well. This past quarter, we had a slightly wetter season, impacted the game of golf and team sports a little bit, but nominally so. And in general, we're very, very excited about the hardlines business. Thanks, Robby. Yes, I would say we're excited about the product pipeline that we see across our strategic partners and we look long-term, obviously, we have long-term strategy planning meetings where we're looking at a couple of years with our strategic partners. I'm also very excited, as we all are, about our flagship vertical brands, the CALIA, DSG, VRST, doing incredibly well and some of our emerging brands. Within our strategic partners, we are very excited about the long-term work that we saw in Nike. We were there at the innovation summit and then more recently we were in their offices and looking at future innovation. I would call out things like the technology that they are bringing to the air platform. It's going to be very exciting from a consumer standpoint. We're really excited about the elevation of both performance apparel and footwear and bringing some newness into those categories. And then they've started to talk about what their Olympic messaging is going to be and we are really, really excited to see that come to market and just drive consumer noise around the Nike brand. So across the board, very excited about that partnership. Thank you. I would point out also that the 50K's continue to deliver incredibly strong results. And the House of Sport, the ones that have been opened the longest, also keep driving growth. So we're really excited, not just about how they open, but how they grow past that. Thank you. Great question. Good. Thanks, Joe. We didn't see an unusually promotional environment in Q1. Certainly the industry overall is in a better place than it was at the end of last year. And our inventory, in particular, 5.5% growth on a 6.2% total comp. We feel really good about our inventory and the healthiness of it. And so I think we continue to manage through whatever promotional environment will come our way, but we have no concerns there and we know that we have the ability to manage with the tools that we have to drive profits. Yeah. Joe, I want to point out, in the long-term, we have a tremendous confidence in the outdoor business. It's a $40 billion TAM. We are building public lands. We're working to moose draw, athletes to bring, explorers rather to bring them in, so that we can really deliver a unique and differentiated experience in the outdoor category. Across the board, the industry does continue to have a post-pandemic reset and we're no different in that than everybody else. But it doesn't take away. It's a small piece of our business, first of all, at this time, and doesn't take away from our confidence, our long-term confidence, that there is a consumer here that we can serve even better than they're being served today. And participation in the outdoor category continues to be high. So when this category rebounds, it's going to, we believe it's going to be really strong. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, great question. Footwear certainly has been a big driver of comps and footwear is a key part of how people shop. It's the engine that drives the train. We're very pleased with our footwear business. Our premium full-service footwear decks, which we started putting into place many years ago, absolutely are driving that elevated experience and then opening us up for more allocations, more specialty brand partners with HOKA and ON and with the premium footwear decks, we'll be at 90% by the end of the year. And obviously, all of our new store development, as we reimagine the portfolio, will have premium full service footwear decks. HOKA and ON are still in a good portion of the chain. There's still significant upside in both brands. HOKA is a little further ahead, been on at this point just in terms of the number of door count, and we're excited to continue to expand those brands as well. Yeah. We had 5.3% comp. We saw growth. We didn't see sluggish trends across our categories. We saw growth across all of the different areas of our business, footwear, apparel, total hardlines, all grew. And I think what we can speak to our story, the consumer is absolutely putting a priority on a healthy and active lifestyle. You see people running and walking, being outdoors. But I think the most important thing is that we are providing them with an experience that they're clearly choosing. And that's both due to the products that we have in our stores as well as the experience that we provide in-store and online. And so it's the core strategies that are coming to life that are driving our performance and we're not seeing any pockets of softness across the country. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we've continued to grow our athlete base over the past several years. I think we had 7 million new athletes joined last year and 1.5 million this past quarter. And traffic has continued to be strong. So it's about new athletes. It's also just about the differentiated product that we keep bringing in and the fact that the elevation of the brand and the experience has been strong. So really, really good traffic numbers and our consumers holding up very, very well. Yeah, great question. And we have the same vision you have. It is the best platform. And really, we started off GameChanger. It was a Diamond Sports focused business. And so while we continue to improve, we're using artificial intelligence to get the video even more exciting and accurate. And there's lots going on behind the scenes there to drive even more excitement there. Our biggest thing in the short term is to grow the Diamond Sports business into other emerging -- they're not emerging sports, but they're emerging to the platform, things like volleyball and other sports, and basketball is a big priority. So that's how we're going to be growing near term. But our vision is big here and we are thinking long-term and how we can continue to develop that connection with our athletes, not just when they're in the store, but when they're at their practice, at their games, and beyond during training. Thank you. Yeah. Paul, thanks for the question. We don't -- we no longer break out stores in an e-comm, and that's because inherently, the customer is so omnichannel and focused that it became a very challenging exercise. But we're very pleased with our digital business and very pleased with how the e-commerce business responds when we open new stores and when a House of Sport comes in the area. It's all a very positive ecosystem story. Now, overall, the categories are delivering on our expectations above them in Q1 and nothing material changed. Thank you. Yeah, so it's a quick question. Yes, we're taking share, really across the board. There's been some consolidation in the industry. We are taking share from, I don't want to call out anybody specifically, but we have our premium footwear assortment, for example, is driving strong interest. Our apparel is driving strong interest. Our vertical brands are meeting consumer needs, even everything from opening price point to true lifestyle. So I would say it's across the board and across the industry that we're seeing share gains. Correct. We didn't. We saw growth across all of our income demographics and we didn't see trade down from best to better, better to good. So pretty consistent across all the income demographics or cohorts. Thank you. Well, thank you all for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. And I just want to take a moment to thank our incredible team in our CSC, our DCs, our stores, our GameChanger offices. It is they who delivered this really strong quarter. I'm very, very thankful and proud of them. Thank you all. We'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Navdeep Gupta",
            "content": "Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a brief review of our first quarter results. We are very pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 6.2% to $3.02 billion. This included a benefit from the calendar shift due to 53rd week last year of approximately $45 million. Adjusting for the calendar shift which we believe provides the clearest view of the business. Our comps increased 5.3% as we continued to gain market share. Our strong comps were on top of a 3.6% comp last year. Our Q1 comps were driven by a 2.7% increase in transactions and a 2.6% increase in average ticket, and we saw strength across footwear, athletic apparel and hardline. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, or 36.29% of net sales and increased 10 basis points from last year. This included leverage on occupancy costs due to higher sales and a decline in merchandise margin of 45 basis points which included higher year-over-year shrink of 22 basis points. It's worth noting that while we anticipated our shrink to be higher than the previous year, the increase in shrink moderated compared to our expectations. On a non-GAAP basis, as expected, SG&A expenses increased 6.6% to $739.7 million and deleveraged 10 basis points compared to last year. This increase in SG&A dollars included investments in the exciting brand campaigns we introduced earlier this year supporting CALIA, DSG as well as Golf Galaxy and DICKS.com. This also included higher estimated incentive compensation expense and cost in support of our sales growth. Pre-opening expenses were $21.1 million, an increase of $11.9 million compared to the prior year. This expected increase was primarily driven by our Q1 House of Sport openings. As Nate noted earlier, SG&A and pre-opening expenses have been adjusted in the current and prior years to reflect the reclassification of grand opening advertising from SG&A to pre-opening expenses. EBT was $342.4 million, or 11.34% of net sales. This compares to EBT of $328.3 million, or 11.55% of net sales in Q1 of 2023. As expected, our Q1 tax rate grew from 7.2% in last year's quarter to 19.6% this year. I'll remind you that this approximate 1,200 basis points increase reflects the higher tax deduction from the vesting of employee equity awards and exercises in the prior year, which favorably impacted Q1 2023 earnings by approximately $0.45 compared to the current year quarter. In total, we delivered earnings per diluted share of $3.30. This compares to earnings per diluted share of $3.40 last year. Now, looking to our balance sheet, we ended Q1 with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $1.6 billion unsecured credit facility. Our quarter-end inventory levels increased 5.5% compared to Q1 of last year, slightly below our 6.2% increase in sales. We believe our inventory is clean and well-positioned. Turning to our first quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $126 million and we paid $94 million in quarterly dividends. We also repurchased 548,000 shares of our stock for $113.6 million at an average price of $207.32. In 2024, we continue to expect share repurchases of $300 million. Now, turning to our outlook for 2024. As a result of our strong Q1 performance, our expectations for continued robust demand from athletes and the confidence we have in our business, we are raising our full-year outlook. We now expect consolidated sales in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. In addition, we now expect comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3% compared to our prior expectation of 1% to 2% growth. EBT margin is now planned to be at 11.1% at the midpoint compared to 10.9% previously. Gross margin is now expected to expand modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results. We previously expected gross margins to be in-line with 2023 non-GAAP results at approximately 35%. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to leverage modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results. In total, we now anticipate full-year earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.35 to $13.75 compared to our prior expectations of $12.85 to $13.25. Our earnings guidance is based on approximately 83 million average diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of approximately 23% compared to our prior expectation of approximately 24%. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the year. Lastly, as you model 2024, I want to point out a couple of things that we expect to impact comparability of our financial results for the second quarter. First, recall that due to the shifted calendar, we expect our reported total sales to be positively impacted in the first half with an offset in second half. Specifically, given the impact of the shift on a key back-to-school week, we expect our reported total sales in Q2 to be positively impacted by approximately $100 million versus the prior year with an offset in Q3. Second, we will begin to anniversary the higher shrink rates from 2023 in the upcoming second quarter. As a reminder, our shrink in Q2 of last year also included a cumulative unfavorable true-up of actual results from our physical inventories, which reflected an 84 basis points increase over 2022. Consequently, we expect to see year-over-year favorability in shrink during this year's second quarter. In closing, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and remain enthusiastic about the future of our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your interest in DICK'S Sporting Goods. Operator, you may now open the line for questions. Yeah, no. Good morning, Adrienne. And just building on what Lauren said, the focus continues to be, as Lauren said, it's around the core four pillars. And two of those pillars that we talk a lot about is about the athlete experience and the teammate experience. And the work that our store team, as well as, the merchandising team are doing in bringing innovative and very differentiated product to our stores and the store team, the work that they're doing in providing this experience and kind of the fit experience that we are able to provide to our athletes when they walk into the store, whether it's a baseball bat, whether it's a golf club, that we feel is the -- is kind of our differentiator as we see not only within our own industry players, but quite frankly against some of the specialty players that are in the marketplace as well. So that will be a key area for our investments. And like Lauren indicated, we showcase that with the investments in advertising, including our vertical brands and how differentiated they are as part of Q1. But we expect these investments to continue to be balanced against the sales growth that we are delivering here as well. Thank you. And Simeon, we are expecting -- Simeon, I'll just add one more thing to what Lauren said. The merch margin I would say in Q1 was in line with our expectations and we expect merch margin to also expand modestly on a year-over-year basis in '24 compared to non-GAAP 2023 results. Yeah, Simeon, that's a great question. First of all, let me start by saying we were really excited by the results that we delivered here in Q1 and we continue to remain really excited about the future and the opportunities that we see ahead of us. As you can imagine, this is just Q1. We have very early in the year as well as everybody knows what else is happening on a macro-factor basis. So what we have done today in terms of the full-year guidance is it reflects the results that we posted here in Q1 and we maintained largely our expectations for Q2 through Q4. There's a little bit of a disconnect with the external consensus expectation, but I would say, we are appropriately cautious as we think about Q2 through Q4. But we continue to remain really excited about the opportunities that we see for the balance of the year. Thank you. Kate, I'll add two more points to that, to what Lauren said. First of all, the platform itself is a very high growth, both on a sales basis as well as on a -- and as a very profitable platform. So by itself, the business itself is fantastic. The other thing that we have talked about is the fact that the athletes that are both GameChanger user and the ScoreCard user have 2x the revenue profile of just a ScoreCard user. So that indicates also that the level of engagement that we have with these multi-channel athletes is actually really, really exciting and interesting to us as we look to the long-term opportunity with this platform. Yeah, Chris, I'll start with the full-year outlook that we provided. So we expect both the gross margin and the merge margin to expand modestly compared to 2023 non-GAAP results we posted last year. The ingredients within that, if you think about Q1 results, we have already declared what there are a couple of points we shared today around the Q2 expectation that you need to be thinking about as you model this. The first and foremost is we had an 84 basis points of accumulative true-up in shrink last year when we did the physical inventories in that stores. And so we don't anticipate having that same impact this year. So there will be favorability that we expect in shrink results in Q2. And we continue to be appropriately cautious for the balance of the year just on the shrink line itself. And in addition, as you would remind -- you would recall that we were cleaning up some of the inventory in the outdoor space last year in Q2. So we don't anticipate annualizing those actions either because where we have exited Q1 this year, we feel really great about the -- our inventory and the quality of the inventory and most importantly, the assortment that we have available for going into the kind of the key selling season here in Q2. So excited about the assortment and how clean that assortment is. So we expect that action again will not be annualized as we look to Q2. So Warren, first of all, let's start with where the SG&A came in. So SG&A deleveraged 10 basis points here in Q1 and that was driven by the core investments that we are making is including in advertising. So because we see clearly an opportunity to continue to position, especially at flagship vertical brands in a much more appropriate fashion with our athletes because those brands, like Lauren said, are resonating so well. So you saw us come out with advertising message around CALIA around DSG as well as drove the brand awareness for our dotcom platform with DICKS.com. So that will be an area that we said we were going to invest in Q1 and the early part of the year, and we did that. And then on a full-year basis what we have guided is we expect our SG&A to modestly leverage on a year-over-year basis. So we are being prudent in how we are making investment. You called out we are making investments in talent, in technology, as well as in the store service level, especially as you look to the House of Sport as well as the 50K. And those are kind of the planned investments that we are making in addition to investments that we are making in store training. So we will continue to look to make these core investments that are driving the differentiation in the marketplace and are resonating really well with the athletes. However, balancing that also against the overall ability to drive the leverage on the SG&A line for the full year. Yeah. So the $35 million that we shared last quarter, that's kind of our expectation for an average House of Sport on an omni basis. That includes both the store as well as the e-comm business. And we have rolled out 12 stores based -- this is based off of the learning informed by those 12 stores that we have opened at the end of 2023 and we continue to be really excited with the two store openings that we have done here in Q1. Thank you. Yeah, Mike, great question. I won't provide quarterly guidance today, but what we have given to you are some of the key ingredients. On a full-year basis, we expect our EBT margin to expand driven by the fact that we expect gross margin to expand modestly as well as our SG&A to leverage modestly compared to non-GAAP results for 2023. You called out really well that the drivers of that will be definitely here in Q2. Keep in mind, Q2 will also have the higher amount of leverage being driven by the $100 million of sales shift that we're going to see from Q3 into Q2. In terms of the long-term expectation, we continue to be really, call it, excited about both the ability to grow our top-line sales as well as the bottom-line profitability over the long-term. Those are, I'll call them, they're right investments. They're like Lauren said, they are driving such an excitement in the community and the overall results that we are driving here in these stores. But great question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So from a shrink perspective, we said that we will be having favorable impact in Q2 and then we continue to be appropriately cautious. We have counted half of the chain and still half of the chain needs to be counted. So as you can imagine, we want to be cautious in our expectation for shrink. And on the merch margin side, we continue to be really enthusiastic about the work that our merchant team is doing in terms of the differentiated product assortment we are bringing, the work that we are doing and how well our flagship vertical brands are performing between CALIA, DSG, VRST. And so we continue to be -- I won't break down merch margin expectations deeper than that, but we expect to grow our margins, both the gross margins and merch margin, on a year-over-year basis modestly as we look to the full year. Yeah, I would say, as you can imagine, it's $45 million. So you can appropriately do a flow-through calculation on that. And this is -- this -- the shift is happening in the early part of the year or -- so you can appropriately adjust your margin expectation in the SG&A. I would say, net between the Q2 and Q3, the impact would be neutral. It's just that Q2 is going to get a favorable impact with $100 million of sales within approximately the same amount of an offsetting impact in Q3. Thank you. No, I don't know, if I'll give any more specific guidance on a quarterly basis, but as you can imagine, in addition to kind of the lapping of the clearance activity that you called out, we will be favorable against the shrink true up that we had almost about 84 basis points of an unfavorable impact that we saw in Q2. I would look at it on a full year basis. We -- like we said, we expect our merch margin to expand on a year-over-year basis as well as the gross margins. Yeah, absolutely. Great question. So, like, shrink, like, it deleveraged 22 basis points here in Q1. It did -- it's -- the shrink is still going up on a year-over-year basis. I want to be clear about it. So that's where we continue to be appropriately cautious as we look to Q3 and Q4 impact on the P&L basis. However, like you said, it did moderate versus our internal expectation, which is a good news trend. But we have only counted half of our chain. So we'll continue to be appropriately cautious as we look to the balance of the year on shrink line. I would give a lot of credit to -- I'll give a little bit of a shout-out to our store team and the DC team, the work that they're doing in -- not just in continuing to move the merchandise, make appropriate operating decisions to keep the stores and our athletes safe. That is allowing us to have a slightly, call it, moderated growth on a year-over-year basis versus our internal expectations. Yes. Yeah, you said both of the facts really well. Yes, the favorable, the impact was -- the favorable impact to comp was about 20 basis points. And we expect that on a full-year basis. It will range between 20 basis points to 30 basis points. And our full year expectation from the GameChanger platform is to deliver about $100 million of sales yet in 2024. Thank you. Yeah, no, we are definitely focused on investing in appropriate capabilities and quite frankly, we have been doing this all along 2023 itself. The big area of investments continue to be in talent, right, bringing the right talent that is helping us do these store openings have the successful openings not just of the House of Sport, but the 50K. There is a lot of investment, as you can imagine, that is going in technology area, which as you can imagine, that is allowing us to get the top-line returns from those investments. And it's also helping us drive productivity improvements, which we are then able to reinvest that into the business. And then the third area continues to be investment appropriately within the advertising line, driving the brand awareness as well as the growth in our vertical brands. That's generally a fair statement, but I would say again, we -- on a long-term basis, we expect both to drive top-line growth as well as the bottom-line profitability improvement. It will be balanced between the margin investment opportunity or the SG&A investment opportunities. Yeah, Jonathan, I would say the answer to the first question is the same, right? The -- what is driving increased basket size when the athletes come to our store as well as the overall ticket continues to be driven by the differentiated product that we have access to. This is the product that is highly coveted, highly in demand right now. So having that product allows you to not only capture the demand that is walking into the store or online, but you are able to get a much better recovery on that full-price selling as well. So the premium assortment and the premium product as well as the most allocated and sought-after product continues to drive both the -- our ticket size as well as the basket size when the athletes come. And in terms of the guidance, we don't provide the guidance at that level. So I'll continue to keep the comp guidance of 2% to 3% for the full year at the highest level. And we continue to be really excited about the balance trend that we are driving between the traffic growth as well as the ticket growth."
