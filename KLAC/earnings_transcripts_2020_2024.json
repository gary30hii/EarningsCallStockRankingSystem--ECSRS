At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA\u2019s fiscal Q4 2020 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of our June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2020 that we released today after the market close in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All these documents can be found on the IR section of our website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy and links to KLA\u2019s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosed in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. As we mentioned last quarter, we are changing the format of these calls to provide deeper insights into KLA and our business performance and also a lot more time for Q&A. beginning of this quarter, we will provide some highlights from our full prepared remarks, which can be found in the shareholders\u2019 letter before beginning our Q&A session. I encourage you all to read the letter. It can be accessed on our KLA IR website. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your families are safe and in good health, and we thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. In many ways, our performance in the June quarter, once again, highlights how the KLA operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today\u2019s extraordinary circumstances. For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I\u2019ll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook. In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It\u2019s also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We\u2019re confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations. Today\u2019s environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries. We\u2019re also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We\u2019ve also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we\u2019re working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers. There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021. Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership. Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We\u2019re forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target. Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We\u2019re very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We\u2019re also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception. Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren.\nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA\u2019s June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies. Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems\u2019 revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%. for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we\u2019d like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur. the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA\u2019s strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges. with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range. With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06. In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we\u2019re on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Sure, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur: good afternoon, solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry\u2019s supply chain, as well as demand trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today, supply chain has come back semiconductor fundamentals while we can, June or as fully showing signs of improvement entering the second half of the year. If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on December, it looks like you will be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low-double digits percentage revenue goal for this calendar year first. is that a fair assumption and maybe some commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre-COVID-19 earlier this year?\nBren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Bren and I\u2019ll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the \u2013 within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don\u2019t think things have changed all that much. I mean, you\u2019re right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we\u2019ve worked through all that and we\u2019ve got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would \u2013 so I don\u2019t want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to \u2013 or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thanks for that. And you entered the June quarter, I remember what the view of strong specialty semiconductor trends, but maybe, more meta trends within some of your other EPC segments like PCB and display as these are more consumer and sort of auto focused \u2013 automotive focus segments for you guys and probably, more impacted by COVID-19. but you\u2019ve got it delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth in the PCB, display and component inspection business. So, what drove these solid trends and how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move through the second half of this year?\nRick Wallace: Yes. thanks, Harlan. We\u2019re really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to \u2013 when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that\u2019s really the ICOS business. We\u2019re also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that\u2019s not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we\u2019re following through on the conversations we\u2019ve had on display, where we\u2019re working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is \u2013 the other thing that\u2019s really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business. So that\u2019s really upside as we go forward. I think it\u2019s pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year \u2013 this year and then into 2021, we\u2019ll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level.\nBren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s bren. The only other thing I\u2019ll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick\u2019s point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential growth. I\u2019m wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the semi process control or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess importantly, do you think that the June quarter and now growth into September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix?\nBren Higgins: Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that\u2019s having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we\u2019re seeing there, I\u2019m encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position. So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we\u2019re experiencing right now.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over the first half, I\u2019m kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of memory and logic/foundry, and how might that have changed over the last 90 days? I don\u2019t want to words in your mouth, but it sounds like maybe, you\u2019re less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps more optimistic about logic/foundry sustaining, and if that\u2019s the case in any read as we go into calendar year 2021.\nRick Wallace: Yes. We do see we see \u2013 we think there\u2019s a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we\u2019re getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that\u2019s really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that\u2019s I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we\u2019re also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and company. Your line is now open.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one either Rick or Bren, clearly, like two of your largest logic and foundry customers have spoken about push out of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the foundry side. with the backdrop, how do you think of KLA\u2019s process control revenue opportunity over the next year or two, given that some of the leading-edge nodes are getting pushed out and then I have a follow-up?\nRick Wallace: Yes. There\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s been discussed publicly that hadn\u2019t been the way we\u2019d been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it\u2019s pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it\u2019s much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There\u2019s plenty of demand at the leading edge. It\u2019s the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we\u2019re heavily involved in. So, we think that there\u2019s a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that\u2019s part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that\u2019s going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we\u2019re helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we\u2019ve been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense?\nKrish Sankar: Yes, yes. that does. thanks a lot, Rick. And then just to follow-up on the product side, you guys introduced pattern wafer e-beam inspection to look semicon. I\u2019m just trying to figure it out, is your e-beam tool still focused on defect detection, or you feel looking at pattern facility of voltage contract, and your competent isn\u2019t going to like multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So, you just want to figure out the e-beam roadmap. Thank you.\nRick Wallace: Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for \u2013 to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they\u2019re really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they\u2019re looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it\u2019s closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn\u2019t have reentered the market if we didn\u2019t feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that\u2019s the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we \u2013 as we map out the future, we don\u2019t see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. your line is now open.\nCJ Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your prepared comments, regarding memory and a greater breadth of spending into Q4 and then beyond into 2021. We\u2019d love to hear kind of what you\u2019re hearing in dialogue with customers there.\nBren Higgins: Yes, CJ. it\u2019s bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter\u2019s memory. It\u2019s lighter than in June. So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn\u2019t all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we\u2019d see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn\u2019t exactly sure when we\u2019d see it. But as we\u2019ve \u2013 so it looks like it\u2019s more December focused. And it \u2013 I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there\u2019s solid momentum as we move into next year. I don\u2019t want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we\u2019ve seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market\u2019s in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021.\nCJ Muse: That\u2019s helpful. As my follow-up for the PCB display and component business including service, how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus the first half? And then as part of that, how should we be thinking about seasonality in terms of peak quarter Q3 versus Q4 given how dominant PCB is within the construct there. Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Yes, SPTS, I would \u2013 it potentially could be flattish half to half. We\u2019ll have to see how it plays out. I think PCB second half will be slightly \u2013 it will probably be lower in the second half, given what\u2019s driven that the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the second half there. on the flat panel business, I wouldn\u2019t expect much to change on that front. It is a 100% consumer focus. There\u2019s virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there\u2019s a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that\u2019s still being worked through. So, I don\u2019t expect any growth; in fact, maybe, second half might be flat to modestly down in that business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Ho: Hi. thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Just maybe, following up CJ\u2019s question about the memory span and timing, typically memory is a little bit more metrology biased versus say logic and foundry being a little more inspection biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries, because what I\u2019m trying to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction with process tools? So, am I looking at that correctly or are there still \u201clead time\u201d in terms of metrology shipments relative to process tools?\nRick Wallace: that\u2019s a good question. Certainly metrology, certain parts of metrology, like in film measurement and overlay tends to scale with capacity, but you also have on patterned inspection that scales also with capacity on the patterned inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development process itself. So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don\u2019t think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that\u2019s how it plays out.\nPatrick Ho: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe, Bren as a follow-up, in terms of the opex management, you probably have gotten some savings over the last several months due to COVID-19 and the diminishing of travel and things of that nature, as we get back to a more normalized environment, how do you balance some of the increases that will come from that versus these attractive OpEx levels that you\u2019re achieving today?\nBren Higgins: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. And we\u2019re probably operating right now, $10 million to $15 million below what I\u2019d considered to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process \u2013 this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we\u2019re going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through \u2013 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins. So, for every incremental dollar of revenue, we\u2019re probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that\u2019s the way that if our incremental gross margins are above 60%. So, it\u2019s a way to think about it. So, we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that\u2019s why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best products out there and we continue to innovate. And so we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. So Bren, I guess that my first question is on the process control revenue. So, [Technical Difficulty] down in June, and I know that, there was maybe, some difficult comps, because of the Q4 last year. but WFE in the first half of this year is definitely up and your process control shipments have been down in March and June, and \u2013 but it sounds like you think that you\u2019re going to at least keep up with the WFE for the year. So that would imply a pretty big back half of the year, given what\u2019s happened here in the first half? Can you maybe, hold our hand a little bit and tell us why you seem to have lost like a little bit of share in the first half and maybe, why process control will be up so much and maybe, help us gauge how much will it be up in September? Are you talking 10% to 15% Q-on-Q? thanks. And then I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: So Tim, we don\u2019t really look at WFE spent half-to-half years. I just look at overall expectations and the way we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we\u2019re mostly in line with the plan that we had and against the backdrop of, let\u2019s say WFE levels that are mid, single-digit growth for the year. I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it\u2019s such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement\u2019s consistent for a process control segment as well.\nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I guess to sum up\u2026\nBren Higgins: But half-to-half, I would expect it to be up. I would expect it to be up half-to-half.\nTimothy Arcuri: And I guess just on that point, can you give us a sense for where you think it\u2019ll be in September and then I guess my follow-up was, you didn\u2019t really purchase any shares in the quarter, which is kind of interesting, why not. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: September, we guide the overall company and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses to meet our expectations. And so I don\u2019t want to guide the semi PC business, but in terms of just overall expectations, I\u2019d expect that business to grow mid single digits versus the June quarter. But that being said, if I\u2019ve got strength in other parts of the company, and I may deploy resources in a different way that that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019re really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to their timing. But I would expect that mid single digit sort of quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment.\nOperator: your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. I think, Rick or Bren, you mentioned some signs of foundry demand perhaps sustaining into next year. I was hoping if you could give us some more color, because I think consensus seems to be that foundry demand could actually \u2013 possibly decline next year. And I realize it\u2019s early, but from what you see today, is it possible that foundry demand could actually be positive next year?\nRick Wallace: Yes, it\u2019s really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it\u2019s been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we\u2019ve been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it\u2019s a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there\u2019s a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes. So, that\u2019s what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we\u2019re having and the \u2013 our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it\u2019s made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick\u2019s point, there\u2019s a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there\u2019s enough in-market demand at the leading edge that\u2019s driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on. So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim\u2019s question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we \u2013 as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we\u2019d expect that we\u2019ll start our capital allocation program. We\u2019ll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline.\nVivek Arya: And if I could ask a quick follow-up, there are two big trends going on. So, TSMC appears to be getting stronger. So, there are fewer, perhaps a high-end, leading edge customers to go after. And then there is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, but I understand it\u2019s probably same demand, but maybe, scattered across a more places that could cause some cyclicality and I don\u2019t know, how do you think KLA is positioned, when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers, and then if there is more sovereign manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than do technology ships or yield improvement? Just how do these two big trends play out for KLA over the next few years? Thank you.\nRick Wallace: I wouldn\u2019t say there are fewer. So, I think if you look at leading edge investment and certainly, our expectations for what we\u2019ve seen in this business, and what we expect going forward is to Rick\u2019s earlier point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that\u2019s in the marketplace versus what we\u2019re doing internally. So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that\u2019s out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries \u2013 if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows. So, we feel pretty good about that. There\u2019s a lot of end demand and there\u2019s specific designs for those \u2013 for that demand. And so I think on the trailing edge side, there\u2019s some start-up costs for new projects or maybe, inefficiency in the market. but over time, they\u2019re building to specific markets and you might see some trading of capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly end demand, but also the technology scaling that\u2019s now happening with EUV.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about opportunities for higher metrology intensity at NAND flash at higher layer counts. So, I\u2019m just curious, as we go into this next memory spending cycle, relative to the half cycle, how do we \u2013 how should we think about just your opportunity there for kind of the peak cycle revenues relative to the last cycle?\nRick Wallace: Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we\u2019ve seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we\u2019ve already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach. The other thing that\u2019s interesting and we didn\u2019t necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they\u2019re back moving forward, we have some product capability. We\u2019ve learned how to solve some of these problems and we\u2019re engaged closely with customers. So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue. It\u2019s not just design rules as you know, but the challenges in the increased number of layers. So, Bren from a standpoint of the numbers.\nBren Higgins: Yes. I think we\u2019ve seen process control share of WFE increased two to three points from the transition from planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick\u2019s point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we\u2019re working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we\u2019ve seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward. On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it\u2019s one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there\u2019s also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side.\nJoe Quatrochi: Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify in your prepared remarks; you talked about the new U.S. restrictions. Is there a change in that at all, relative to what you\u2019ve talked about last quarter, in terms of, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about difficult to predict the near-term dynamics relate to those?\nRick Wallace: Well, and it was \u2013 and we had to go through the exercising, the exercise as did our peer companies, of determining whether or not we were, how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think, all the peer companies have gone through that exercise and we\u2019ve been able to navigate that. As we said, we\u2019re going to obviously follow the law. It was just \u2013 there was some uncertainty as to what exactly how to interpret it. So, we\u2019ve had the benefit of working through those details and feel like we\u2019ve moved on from that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your business in China, it\u2019s been pretty stable as a percentage of revenues. How is that mix shifting between multinationals and China sovereign kind of customers? And what are you seeing specifically from China sovereign customers?\nRick Wallace: We\u2019re seeing growth this year. And so you\u2019ve got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So, my growth statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be 20% or more. So, I think WFE levels in China, for the native China customers are \u2013 is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. So, it certainly is growth this year and it\u2019s more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure centric.\nJoe Moore: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAtif Malik: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and good job on the results and guide. Good to see EPC delivering records in the June quarter. I have a question on 5G, your 5G smartphone exposure on the PCB side gives you an edge over your peers, have based on our work and perhaps the higher stock multiple, how much of the PCB system and services revenues are 5G exposed on an annual basis?\nRick Wallace: So, when we\u2019re looking at it right now, it\u2019s about 50%, and it feels like the success that we\u2019ve had there, as you point out, we\u2019ve got good exposure, we\u2019ve got good products to serve those customers. And we feel like that\u2019s, this is early days where the 5G build-out. So, we think there\u2019s continued opportunity there as we go forward.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then Rick, there was a question earlier on delay at the U.S. logic maker. longer-term, I see you have better exposure to foundry versus that logic maker based on your 10-K, is that shipped up capacity from the U.S. logic maker to Taiwan foundry, potentially neutral for your logic opportunity or a modest positive?\nRick Wallace: It\u2019s really hard to say. I mean, I think part of what we\u2019ve experienced over time is that there are customers that historically, we\u2019ve seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on leading edge and their engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment. So, what we\u2019re seeing now is, people that feel like they\u2019re needing to catch up are investing more to do that. But I think it\u2019s pretty clear, if you want to stay on the leading edge of a lot of logic and foundry, and you don\u2019t have the ability to fully understand and the learning cycles in the fab, you\u2019re going to struggle. So anybody, that\u2019s trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile. That\u2019s why \u2013 what\u2019s really good for us as people that want to do advanced node technology, because they need to invest. And so I would say that if it moves it\u2019s because that they\u2019ve struggled, and if they want to be successful, then they end up investing more. So, I think that what\u2019s really good for KLA\u2019s advanced nodes and the desire people have to support them. I think in \u2013 as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren\u2019t all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that\u2019s what\u2019s really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just \u2013 the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven\u2019t. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking our question and nice results. Just curious on the service side, you had delays getting in and actually doing service, you talked about record number. I\u2019m just kind of curious; sort of you mentioned earlier whether you actually are caught up or plan to catch up as you look into September?\nBren Higgins: Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. and so we feel very good about that on the circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been \u2013 has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We\u2019ve also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market. So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we\u2019re going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation \u2013 annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we\u2019ll be in our target range and because of the scale that we\u2019re now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we\u2019re able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well. So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty good situation right now for service and I think we\u2019ve adapted pretty well. And we\u2019re trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that that are out there today, for us to position this business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward.\nRick Wallace: Yes. I\u2019ll just add to that. I mean, our service guys are really heroes, service guys and girls, this last quarter and this year, they\u2019ve done an amazing job. When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we\u2019re going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don\u2019t want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it\u2019s been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we\u2019d set out pre-COVID for them. So, we feel really good about that.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. I just want to ask on the recovery you\u2019re targeting in memory, just kind of curious on the DRAM side; it was always going be late year. I was just curious if that\u2019s part of any of the recovery you\u2019re targeting?\nRick Wallace: I think DRAMs a little bit, I think flash is better in the \u2013 as I said earlier, I think flash is better in the second half of the year, and that DRAM is probably stronger than the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that can move around a little bit, but that\u2019s how we see it right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Co. Your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Just wanted to come back to the China business, obviously, you haven\u2019t seen a major impact from the commerce department actions. But wondering if you\u2019ve seen any increased threat of de-Americanization of equipment in China, especially, from the domestic suppliers and probably more on the metrology side than the inspection side of your business, where I think you guys are pretty well entrenched?\nRick Wallace: So Quinn, this is Rick, I think since KLA started doing business internationally, when I\u2019ve been in the company back in Japan and whatever, the late 80s, there have always been attempts by our customers in different regions to have supply base. So, there\u2019s never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that\u2019s \u2013 the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we\u2019re competitive, so that we\u2019re more than competitive, we\u2019re compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis. And so you\u2019ve got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that\u2019s always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they\u2019re going to do it. So, we don\u2019t see that as particularly different than it\u2019s been in the past.\nQuinn Bolton: Thanks. And then quick follow-up for Bren, just a nice gross margin guidance in September. I\u2019m wondering if there are any lingering COVID-19 costs that are still affecting that the gross margin possibly in the freight and logistics shipping would be one area.\nBren Higgins: Yes. I don\u2019t think it will \u2013 there are. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change in the September quarter and probably, not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we\u2019ll start to \u2013 we\u2019ll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks. You talk about the setup is pretty good for next year for foundry and logic. Is it mostly driven by the five-nanometer ramble? Are you expecting any contribution from three-nanometer development? I know it\u2019s still early, but maybe broadly speaking, do you have a view when you\u2019re going to start seeing the revenue relate to three nanometers?\nRick Wallace: Yes, both. For sure, we\u2019ll see. I mean, as you know, these things go in cycles of the early \u2013 the early work and then you get the build-out and we also have some of the \u2013 as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of logic that\u2019s a trailing that continues to be the investment. But on the leading edge, sure, we\u2019ll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that\u2019s really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space.\nSidney Ho: Great. Then maybe, my follow-up to \u2013 a follow-up question. Historically, you see process control strength early in the process, and then at phase once the products are in volume production. Do you expect this pattern to continue or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward, given what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market?\nRick Wallace: It really \u2013 it is true. I mean, that trend is true. It\u2019s especially true when there\u2019s fewer \u2013 there\u2019s less innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you\u2019ve got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to \u2013 so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there\u2019s a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location. So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn\u2019t really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don\u2019t have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past.\nKevin Kessel: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. We have a question for Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nWeston Twigg: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just \u2013 there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which \u2013 it\u2019s a more [indiscernible], which intuitively makes sense for the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI, special there\u2019s 5G chips, chips going into different things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think about how that provides uplift for clack overall over the next few years?\nRick Wallace: Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there\u2019s one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don\u2019t change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line. So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What\u2019s interesting about foundry is they don\u2019t force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change. The other thing that we\u2019ve seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers \u2013 customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there\u2019s so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that\u2019s not what\u2019s happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we\u2019re really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that\u2019s a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those. Does that make sense?\nKevin Kessel: Okay, Charlie.\nOperator: Yes, sir. We have no further question at this time, I will now turn the call back to the presenters.\nRick Wallace: Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest. And this concludes the call and Charlie, please provide the final instructions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your families are safe and in good health, and we thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. In many ways, our performance in the June quarter, once again, highlights how the KLA operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today's extraordinary circumstances. For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I'll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook. In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It's also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We're confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations. Today's environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries. We're also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We've also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we're working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers. There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021. Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership. Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We're forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target. Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We're very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We're also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception. Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Bren. Yes. thanks, Harlan. We're really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to \u2013 when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that's really the ICOS business. We're also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that's not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we're following through on the conversations we've had on display, where we're working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is \u2013 the other thing that's really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business. So that's really upside as we go forward. I think it's pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about \u2013 it's pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year \u2013 this year and then into 2021, we'll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level. Yes. We do see we see \u2013 we think there's a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we're getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that's really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that's I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we're also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up. Yes. There's really nothing that's been discussed publicly that hadn't been the way we'd been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it's pretty much consistent with what we've seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it's much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There's plenty of demand at the leading edge. It's the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we're heavily involved in. So, we think that there's a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that's part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that's going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we're helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we've been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense? Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for \u2013 to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they're really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they're looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it's closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that's what we're seeing. We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn't have reentered the market if we didn't feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that's the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we \u2013 as we map out the future, we don't see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution. that's a good question. Certainly metrology, certain parts of metrology, like in film measurement and overlay tends to scale with capacity, but you also have on patterned inspection that scales also with capacity on the patterned inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development process itself. So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don't think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that's how it plays out. Yes, it's really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it's been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we've been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it's a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there's a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we're seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes. So, that's what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we're having and the \u2013 our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it's made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick's point, there's a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there's enough in-market demand at the leading edge that's driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on. So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim's question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we \u2013 as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we'd expect that we'll start our capital allocation program. We'll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline. I wouldn't say there are fewer. So, I think if you look at leading edge investment and certainly, our expectations for what we've seen in this business, and what we expect going forward is to Rick's earlier point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that's in the marketplace versus what we're doing internally. So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that's out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries \u2013 if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows. So, we feel pretty good about that. There's a lot of end demand and there's specific designs for those \u2013 for that demand. And so I think on the trailing edge side, there's some start-up costs for new projects or maybe, inefficiency in the market. but over time, they're building to specific markets and you might see some trading of capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly end demand, but also the technology scaling that's now happening with EUV. Yes. I'll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we've seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that's something that we're pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we've already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach. The other thing that's interesting and we didn't necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they're back moving forward, we have some product capability. We've learned how to solve some of these problems and we're engaged closely with customers. So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue. It's not just design rules as you know, but the challenges in the increased number of layers. So, Bren from a standpoint of the numbers. Well, and it was \u2013 and we had to go through the exercising, the exercise as did our peer companies, of determining whether or not we were, how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think, all the peer companies have gone through that exercise and we've been able to navigate that. As we said, we're going to obviously follow the law. It was just \u2013 there was some uncertainty as to what exactly how to interpret it. So, we've had the benefit of working through those details and feel like we've moved on from that. We're seeing growth this year. And so you've got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So, my growth statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be 20% or more. So, I think WFE levels in China, for the native China customers are \u2013 is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. So, it certainly is growth this year and it's more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure centric. So, when we're looking at it right now, it's about 50%, and it feels like the success that we've had there, as you point out, we've got good exposure, we've got good products to serve those customers. And we feel like that's, this is early days where the 5G build-out. So, we think there's continued opportunity there as we go forward. It's really hard to say. I mean, I think part of what we've experienced over time is that there are customers that historically, we've seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on leading edge and their engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment. So, what we're seeing now is, people that feel like they're needing to catch up are investing more to do that. But I think it's pretty clear, if you want to stay on the leading edge of a lot of logic and foundry, and you don't have the ability to fully understand and the learning cycles in the fab, you're going to struggle. So anybody, that's trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile. That's why \u2013 what's really good for us as people that want to do advanced node technology, because they need to invest. And so I would say that if it moves it's because that they've struggled, and if they want to be successful, then they end up investing more. So, I think that what's really good for KLA's advanced nodes and the desire people have to support them. I think in \u2013 as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren't all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that's what's really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just \u2013 the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven't. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board. Yes. I'll just add to that. I mean, our service guys are really heroes, service guys and girls, this last quarter and this year, they've done an amazing job. When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we're going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don't want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it's been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we'd set out pre-COVID for them. So, we feel really good about that. I think DRAMs a little bit, I think flash is better in the \u2013 as I said earlier, I think flash is better in the second half of the year, and that DRAM is probably stronger than the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that can move around a little bit, but that's how we see it right now. So Quinn, this is Rick, I think since KLA started doing business internationally, when I've been in the company back in Japan and whatever, the late 80s, there have always been attempts by our customers in different regions to have supply base. So, there's never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that's \u2013 the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we're competitive, so that we're more than competitive, we're compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis. And so you've got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that's always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they're going to do it. So, we don't see that as particularly different than it's been in the past. Yes, both. For sure, we'll see. I mean, as you know, these things go in cycles of the early \u2013 the early work and then you get the build-out and we also have some of the \u2013 as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of logic that's a trailing that continues to be the investment. But on the leading edge, sure, we'll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that's really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space. It really \u2013 it is true. I mean, that trend is true. It's especially true when there's fewer \u2013 there's less innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you've got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to \u2013 so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there's a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location. So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn't really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don't have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past. Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there's one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don't change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line. So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What's interesting about foundry is they don't force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change. The other thing that we've seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers \u2013 customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there's so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that's not what's happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we're really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that's a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those. Does that make sense? Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest. And this concludes the call and Charlie, please provide the final instructions."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. KLA's June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies. Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems' revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%. for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we'd like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur. the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA's strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges. with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range. With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06. In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we're on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Hey, Harlan, it's Bren and I'll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the \u2013 within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don't think things have changed all that much. I mean, you're right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we've worked through all that and we've got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would \u2013 so I don't want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to \u2013 or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it. Hey, Harlan, it's bren. The only other thing I'll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick's point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB. Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we're seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that's having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we're seeing there, I'm encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position. So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we're experiencing right now. Yes, CJ. it's bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter's memory. It's lighter than in June. So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn't all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we'd see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn't exactly sure when we'd see it. But as we've \u2013 so it looks like it's more December focused. And it \u2013 I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there's solid momentum as we move into next year. I don't want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we've seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market's in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021. Yes, SPTS, I would \u2013 it potentially could be flattish half to half. We'll have to see how it plays out. I think PCB second half will be slightly \u2013 it will probably be lower in the second half, given what's driven that the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the second half there. on the flat panel business, I wouldn't expect much to change on that front. It is a 100% consumer focus. There's virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there's a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that's still being worked through. So, I don't expect any growth; in fact, maybe, second half might be flat to modestly down in that business. Yes, that's a good question. And we're probably operating right now, $10 million to $15 million below what I'd considered to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process \u2013 this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we're going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through \u2013 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins. So, for every incremental dollar of revenue, we're probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that's the way that if our incremental gross margins are above 60%. So, it's a way to think about it. So, we're going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that's why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we've got the best products out there and we continue to innovate. And so we're going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term model. So Tim, we don't really look at WFE spent half-to-half years. I just look at overall expectations and the way we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we're mostly in line with the plan that we had and against the backdrop of, let's say WFE levels that are mid, single-digit growth for the year. I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it's such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement's consistent for a process control segment as well. But half-to-half, I would expect it to be up. I would expect it to be up half-to-half. September, we guide the overall company and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses to meet our expectations. And so I don't want to guide the semi PC business, but in terms of just overall expectations, I'd expect that business to grow mid single digits versus the June quarter. But that being said, if I've got strength in other parts of the company, and I may deploy resources in a different way that that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers, but at the end of the day, what we're really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to their timing. But I would expect that mid single digit sort of quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment. Yes. I think we've seen process control share of WFE increased two to three points from the transition from planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick's point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we're working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we've seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward. On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it's one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there's also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side. Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. and so we feel very good about that on the circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been \u2013 has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We've also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market. So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we're going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation \u2013 annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we'll be in our target range and because of the scale that we're now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we're able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well. So that's \u2013 it's a pretty good situation right now for service and I think we've adapted pretty well. And we're trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that that are out there today, for us to position this business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward. Yes. I don't think it will \u2013 there are. And I don't think it'll change in the September quarter and probably, not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we'll start to \u2013 we'll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there."

[Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations with KLA Corporation. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Charlie. And welcome to KLA's earnings conference call to discuss the results of the March 2020 quarter and the outlook for the June quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2020, that we released today after the market close and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n Today's discussion and our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA IR website, along with our newly published shareholder letter.\n Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events and presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. \nRichard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today in these extraordinary times. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.\n KLA delivered strong results in the March 2020 quarter. Revenue finished at the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint of the guidance range, demonstrating strong demand from our customers and exceptional execution across our global KLA operations. KLA's performance in the March quarter highlights how the company's operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a strong and resilient framework to guide our execution and consistently deliver on our commitments even during unprecedented challenges.\n In our prepared remarks today, we will discuss how KLA's unique and sustainable competitive advantages helped us consistently deliver strong relative results, while showcasing the enduring strength of the KLA investment thesis. We will also discuss how KLA is positioned to confidently navigate through these periods of uncertainty.\n To lead off, I want to highlight KLA's priorities and actions in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Please turn to Slide 4. First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our partners. We began taking proactive measures for our teams as soon as we saw the outbreak begin in China, including immediately eliminating nonessential travel, canceling our annual sales conference, our global engineering conference as well as the KLA Lithography Users Forum at SPIE.\n A large percentage of our workforce is in China and the Pacific region, and we initiated a global crisis management team to ensure we had insight into needs and activities at the local levels to provide assistance as needed. As information and shelter-in-place orders began to roll out across the globe, we prioritized rapid communications to our employees. And we immediately instituted guidelines and policies to ensure that our essential workforce could operate in safe conditions, and we remain focused on that daily.\n Specifically, as our teams worldwide have largely had to shift to working from home, we worked hard to maintain our ability to support our customers in this unique scenario. At our manufacturing facilities, we have focused on creating a significantly reduced employee footprint. We have rigorous social distancing and cleaning guidelines and health checks to allow our teams to be safe while staying on track with shipping, installing and delivering the essential services we provide to our customers.\n I'd like to personally commend our global team for their resourcefulness and commitment to executing under these challenging circumstances. Our customer feedback has been outstanding. And our business is healthy and performing well under unprecedented conditions. I'm really proud of the way we as a company have responded to these challenges. It really reflects the extraordinary strength of our teams guided by the KLA core values of perseverance, drive to be better, high-performing teams and indispensability.\n For our global employee base, we recognize that this crisis also extends well beyond the disruption to their work life. And we're focusing on continuing to ensure that we can support them in any way that we can.\n I'd also like to note that we took action to support our communities by creating a KLA Foundation Global Relief Fund, where we committed $2 million in global relief efforts to benefit local nonprofit organizations, which are working in areas identified as having a high number of affected individuals and with those who are with high-risk populations in Asia, Europe, Israel and the United States. Above all, we remain advocates for the holistic health and safety of our employees as well as the communities they work and live in.\n Turn now to Slide 5 for some comments on the industry demand environment. Though we were encouraged to see many of our customers in China return to full production late in the quarter, COVID-19 has already impacted global economic growth. The question remains whether it will result in a short-term pushout in global demand supported by substantial levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments or whether it leads to long-term demand decline followed by an elongated recovery. Many economic prognosticators now expect a global recession as the effects of business disruption, rising unemployment and reduction in consumer spending are felt across the global economy.\n So at KLA, we're not predicting the depth or duration of this impact until we have more evidence about the evolution of the crisis. But if there's one thing we do know, it's the situation is rapidly evolving. And at this stage, the full impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand and the global economy remains unclear. But from our point of view, although the semiconductor equipment industry is currently supply-constrained, customer demand remains strong in the first half of 2020. And to underscore that point, KLA delivered record shipments of our semiconductor process control systems during the quarter, and total backlog finished at record levels exiting March.\n It's also important to point out that KLA is most levered to our customers' strategic R&D investments and their product road maps for leading-edge technologies across foundry, logic and memory. Our customers use these investments as critical to their long-term growth strategies and their competitive positioning. And therefore, they tend to be more resilient.\n Now in the near and medium term, we see increased semiconductor device demands for enterprise and cloud applications in response to the surge in work from home and a pickup in gaming. Now this is somewhat offset by a decline in some consumer-facing end markets. We also see strong results in our specialty semiconductor markets with demand driven by 5G infrastructure investment, particularly in China. We're fulfilling urgent requests to supply products essential in MEMS manufacturing and power technologies focused on medical applications such as smart thermometers and ventilators, which are directly addressing the crisis.\n It's clear health care will be one of the many industries which will be profoundly impacted with the acceleration of technology implementation, virtual capabilities and automation. We know that KLA is not immune to the impact this crisis may have on customers' capital investment plans over the next several months. However, we do draw some confidence from the historical evidence that our customers tend to maintain their investment in next-generation development in times of semiconductor industry contraction and uncertainty, which makes KLA's revenue more resilient in times like this.\n As an example, I'd point out that in 2019, according to the recent Gartner market share analysis, total WFE investment was estimated to decline about 6%, but KLA semiconductor process control business grew at 1%. Taking a step back even further, it's worth highlighting that KLA's business has always declined less than the industry in periods of general contraction.\n Also, KLA's service business, which accounts for roughly 1/4 of our total revenues today and has strong and growing profitability, also tends to demonstrate exceptional resilience throughout the business cycle, given the unique nature of our service model with 70% to 75% of the revenue being subscription-like contracts.\n Given the continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our market leadership and strong balance sheet, KLA is in a very strong position to navigate this period of uncertainty and to capitalize on opportunities to drive long-term growth for our industry once the conditions eventually normalize. Even though we couldn't have anticipated what we're experiencing today, we believe that secular factors driving the industry demand and our 2023 revenue and EPS targets remain largely intact, and they'll drive diversified growth with operating leverage over the long term.\n Finally, in many ways, the global response to COVID-19 is accelerating secular drivers of the industry growth that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. And that gives us strong optimism that we and our industry will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. We always knew we had compelling secular growth trends a year ago, but if anything, these trends will be stronger and more important going forward. Whether it's the move to Industry 4.0 or factory automation, the rising semiconductor content in automobiles, remote medical diagnostics and care, 5G, ubiquitous connectivity supported by continued data center build-outs or new, more capable handset offerings, the new work-from-home reality or the overall acceleration of digitization and move to the data era, everything will depend on advancing semiconductor technology that KLA helps to make possible.\n Please turn to Slide 6 and 7 for a review of the KLA operating model and our strategic objectives. As in prior industry downturns, one thing that remains a constant, serving as our guide as we manage through this uncertainty, is the KLA operating model. This codifies our corporate values and management principles and defines the critical core competencies that drive our performance and represents a solid and enduring framework for the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. The KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy. It ties accountability to results, ensures product development execution and facilitates continuous improvement, while ensuring the company always operates with strong financial discipline while driving long-term performance and profitability objectives.\n As we indicated during our September 2019 Investor Day, we're also leveraging the KLA operating model to strengthen the performance of new businesses. We have recently reorganized the former Orbotech units under the leadership of long-term KLA Executive Vice President Oreste Donzella, creating the new Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group. This new organization will help drive synergies and growth across the broad electronics value chain, including specialty semiconductors, packaging, printed circuit boards and flat panel display.\n Guided by this and with our global team's experience navigating through various industry cycles and downturns over the years, we have the benefit of history and the processes in place to maintain a high level of investment, which is critical to our market leadership and our customers' technology road map, while at the same time, protecting and preserving operating margins.\n Please turn to Slide 8 for the March quarter 2020 business highlights. In closing, I'd like to mention 4 highlights that stood out this quarter. First, as I mentioned at the outset, KLA achieved record company-wide shipments driven by record shipments in our Semiconductor Process Control segment, and we ended March with record backlog. This illustrates the overall momentum we are having in the marketplace across various product platforms with particular strength in mask inspection, patterned optical inspection and films metrology. And it further shores up our confidence in the long-term future growth position for the company.\n Secondly, we're really pleased to see KLA's customer success being further validated by third-party market share analysis from Gartner. KLA's market leadership is the result of ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiated products and a portfolio of products and solutions that address the most critical process control market challenges. And we're pleased once again to see the success of our strategy being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions.\n The report shows that process control grew as a percent of overall WFE, and KLA strengthened its process control market leadership by gaining 2.5 points of market share. The past year marked a record or new record demand in KLA's core franchises such as optical wafer inspection, overlay metrology and mask inspection. This data also shows KLA's first meaningful revenue in e-beam inspection since 2015. We expect the process control intensity will continue to stay at a similar level in calendar 2020 or better and that KLA will maintain our market leadership, driven by an expanding EUV investment environment as well as advanced technology development in memory and continued semiconductor industry expansion in China.\n Third, we saw continued strength in both foundry and logic. Foundry and logic revenue grew sequentially as customers accelerated the ramp of both 7- and 5-nanometer nodes and continue to prioritize their leading-edge technology road maps.\n And finally, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and steady free cash flow in calendar 2020 despite all the uncertainty. Total KLA service revenue rose to $373 million, thanks to the continued growth of our Semiconductor Process Control installed base as well as the expanding service businesses from recent acquisitions.\n Please turn to Slide 9 for my concluding thoughts. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Bren, we're in extraordinary times. And in that, we're facing both unprecedented uncertainties as well as opportunities. But amidst this background, one thing that's not changing is KLA's strong fundamentals. And we're confident that our strategies and the actions we're taking today will continue to lead us in the right direction and position us to emerge even stronger and more resilient.\n KLA's March quarter indicates the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We expect to be able to continue to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while protecting operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our capital return strategies. As I stated earlier, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to preserve the health and safety of our employees and their families. We believe that this is a new reality, and we're going to be in this for some time, but we're confident we can work together to get through it and continue to deliver in the way we know how.\n I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bren, to discuss our financial results and guidance. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 11 for quarterly financial highlights. KLA delivered a solid quarter in March with revenue at the midpoint and non-GAAP EPS finishing at the upper end of the company's guidance ranges. \n Total revenue was $1.424 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 59.5% to 61.5%, driven by a richer product mix than was modeled at the beginning of the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.47. At the guided tax planning rate of 13%, EPS would have been $2.52. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS includes an impairment of goodwill of $257 million and a $22.5 million loss related to the extinguishment of our November '21 notes that we refinanced in a new bond offering in February.\n Let me briefly provide more context on the goodwill impairment. During the March quarter, and consistent with our policy, KLA conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment based on the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. Given the uncertainty of the current environment and the associated unknown long-run trajectory of economic growth, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $257 million in the third quarter to write down a portion of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Orbotech acquisition.\n Before going into further detail on quarterly results, I want to echo Rick's comments and say that while the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and presents new challenges to running our business, one thing remains clear. KLA has a resilient business model underpinned by a rock-solid investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis.\n Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and our recent bond offering and refinancing means that we are in a great position and don't have any bond maturities until late 2024. To further expand on that point, I want to highlight that in February, KLA issued $750 million and 3.3% 30-year bonds to redeem $500 million in aggregate principal amount 4.125% senior notes due in November of 2021. And S&P upgraded our credit rating one notch earlier in the quarter to BBB+.\n Given our solid balance sheet and consistently robust free cash flow that our business generates, we believe KLA has enough cash and liquidity to respond to any operating condition, while still being able to execute our long-term strategies, invest at a high level in new capabilities across our product portfolio and maintain our well-articulated capital returns approach, which includes our current $3.40 annual per share dividend.\n Regarding capital management and deployment, as you would expect, we are reviewing all operating expenses and capital expenditure plans to prioritize and optimize them given the current business conditions and economic environment. One thing is certain. We remain committed to returning 70% or more free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases.\n In March, we were consistent with our long-standing capital return framework, returning 113% of quarterly free cash flow to investors, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend distributions and $316 million in repurchases of common stock. KLA currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\n Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 for the breakdown of revenue by segments, end markets, products and regions. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, which includes associated service business, was healthy at $1.18 billion. Foundry was once again very strong in March at approximately 55% of Semi Process Control revenue, up from 52% last quarter. Memory was 31% in March, down from 40%. Logic was 14% versus 8% last quarter.\n Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment was $85 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by strength in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $160 million, down 14% sequentially and slightly below our internal plans as these businesses, which are closer to consumer markets, softened somewhat as we moved through the quarter.\n Now for the breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, starting with the distribution of revenue by major product category. Wafer inspection was 38%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 21%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the Semiconductor Process Control segment. Specialty Semiconductor Process was 5%. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 7%. Service was 26% of revenue in the quarter and other was 3%.\n The regional split of revenue was as follows: China was 25%. Taiwan was 24%. Korea was 21%. The U.S. and Japan were 11% each. Europe, including Israel, was 5%. And the rest of Asia was 3%.\n Please turn to Slide 14 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $378 million, including $215 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were modestly below our targets for the quarter, with the largest delta to plan coming from lower travel and entertainment expenses and a slower hiring pace than was originally planned. Operating margin was 34.6%. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $38 million.\n The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% and above the company's long-term tax planning rate of 13% due to negative capital market impact on expense deductions in the company's employee deferred compensation program. Going forward, based on the company's expectations for geographic distribution of profit, you should continue to use 13% as a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $389 million, and the company had approximately 157 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n Turning now to a review of our balance sheet and free cash flow on Slides 15 and 16. KLA ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.\n Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong, coming in at $442 million and $399 million, respectively. Free cash flow margin was 28%, and the annualized free cash flow yield was above 6%. For a frame of reference, over the last 10 years, KLA's free cash flow margin averaged 25%. KLA's business model generates strong free cash flow and is very resilient across the various phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the past 5 years, the company has averaged 98% free cash flow conversion.\n Please turn to Slide 17 for a snapshot of our capital return activities. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchase shares being roughly $73, with approximately $4.1 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010.\n Now for our June 2020 guidance on Slide 18. I will start by saying we have mitigated the supply chain issues related to COVID-19 that arose over the past quarter, but fluidity related to this situation makes it a daily challenge to manage as countries around the world handle their respective coronavirus responses. The uncertainties and added complexity associated with global social distancing policies, such as travel restrictions and mandated quarantine periods, continue to pose challenges to our ability to install and support KLA systems.\n Accordingly, we have taken extra measures to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain. Somewhat unique to KLA's business model are longer material lead times and volume hedging strategies that -- to enable flexibility with key components in our products, which slows inventory velocity but allows us to weather short-term disruptions in supply. For short lead time parts, we maintain dual supplier strategies, mostly with suppliers in different countries to optimize capital commitments and ensure we can shift supply to maintain flexibility to meet fluid customer delivery schedules.\n In addition, our customers rely on KLA to enable their long-term technology development programs, which tend to be sustained and protected in periods of short-term demand uncertainty and disruption, such as we are currently experiencing. We continue to maintain close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply chain pressure points, and we remain confident today in our ability to meet our demand and to be able to continue to service and support our customers in the field.\n KLA is managing this situation with both determination and creativity. We have fully mobilized our teams and are taking action to minimize disruption in our operations, meet essential customer needs and maintain the resilience of our supply chain to limit the overall impact of COVID-19 across our business.\n Given the scale of our worldwide service and support infrastructure, we are supporting our customers with local resources and are executing well. However, it is taking longer in some cases to complete rigorous acceptance criteria for certain products without the support of our factory-centric teams. In all cases, we've done our best to contemplate these factors in our guidance, including the broader range of guidance in our June quarter outlook, which is as follows. Total revenue for the June quarter is expected to be in a range of $1.26 billion to $1.54 billion. Foundry is forecasted to be about 51% of Semi Process Control system revenue, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. Memory is expected to be approximately 39%. Logic is expected to be about 10% of Semiconductor Process Control system revenue.\n We forecast gross margin to be in a range of 59% to 61% as product mix is modestly less favorable and slightly higher costs are expected in our service business than in the March quarter. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13%.\n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.58 to $2.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.87. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 156 million shares.\n For my financial conclusion, please turn to Slide 19. I'd like to share our perspective on the demand environment for the balance of the year 2020. First, I'd like to address the new export rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, which will go into effect on June 29, 2020. Those rules will expand export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that have operations that could support military end uses even if the item sold by the U.S. companies are used for civilian purposes only.\n On this issue, I would note that the new rules do not impact the majority of our business as most of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. I would also like to point out that we routinely ensure that our products are not used for prohibited military end uses in China. However, the question remains today whether these new rules, when enacted, would make it more difficult to ship to certain customers in China that might be deemed military end users under the new rules as a result of their potential activities supporting military end uses.\n We are still assessing the new rules and working with trade associations and others to obtain additional guidance from the U.S. government regarding the scope and practical application of these new rules. Once we have clarity on how these rules will be implemented, we can better determine the impact on our business, if any, in the second half of the calendar year.\n Notwithstanding this recent trade issue, our outlook for customer demand in the Semiconductor Process Control business is virtually unchanged today from what we expected in February. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our supply chain in our factories to meet current customer expectations for deliveries. However, we do expect that the overall macroeconomic environment will put pressure at some point on some of our customers' demand for products in certain segments and ultimately could affect their capacity investment plans, both in magnitude and timing.\n Obviously, the depth and duration of this impact is unknown today, so we will continue to run our business to maintain the flexibility to respond to any demand scenario. We do expect our customers to continue to progress their technology road maps across all segments, and KLA products are critical to those transitions. We expect investments to continue in this area at a normalized pace, independent of the macro environment.\n For our more consumer-centric businesses, we have seen some weakness over the course of the March quarter. And while we are well positioned, we would expect some impact to these businesses compared to what we thought in early February.\n Finally, collaboration across global teams and partners on large-scale product development programs without direct in-person engagement is creating some execution challenges, and while early, could put pressure on release dates for new products expected over the next 12 months.\n To summarize, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, KLA continues to be well positioned to navigate the uncharted territory we find ourselves in. We derive our strength from our strong balance sheet and liquidity and comfort from not having any bond maturities until late in 2024. Our strong operating performance helps us prioritize critical investments across our technology portfolio and protects our margins while simultaneously generating strong and consistent free cash flow.\n Our market position has never been stronger. Despite the usual competitive noise, our share gain and improving process control intensity serve as validation that our products -- our portfolio of products and solutions are adding critical value to our customers' technology road map differentiation and their ability to yield these new technologies at production volumes.\n How we allocate capital has never been more important. You can be assured, we will continue to make smart capital allocation decisions, continue to invest in the important R&D to support our customers and new product launches, fuel our long-term growth strategy, maintain our ongoing dividend strategy and preserve our ability to be opportunistic with our buyback program to fully deploy the free cash flow of the company.\n Lastly, predictability and business model resiliency matter more now than ever. Our growing diversification, significant exposure to our customers' critical process technology transitions, our subscription-like service revenue stream and our focus on driving operating leverage are key attributes of our business model. We are confident we can continue to excel in managing these areas and position KLA for a brighter future.\n Before we begin the Q&A, just a reminder that KLA will participate in many virtual investor webcasted conferences this quarter. Please keep an eye out for notice of future event scheduling, and we look forward to seeing some of you virtually later in the quarter.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kessel to begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Charlie, we're ready for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Solid job on the quarterly execution. On the increased revenue guidance range for June, $280 million range versus $200 million for last quarter. You called out the COVID-19-related impact. It sounds like it's still more operational, logistics, personnel support. But I wondered if there's some part of that, that is demand related, potential pushing out of the business by customers either in your process control or Orbotech businesses on the potential for maybe some second half macro demand weakness. I'm just trying to figure out where the bias is skewed towards the larger range. \nBren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. I hope you're doing well. So the bias is more around just the operational constraints. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are having to support the tools with our local teams, particularly around installations, and that can take a little bit longer. And as a result of that and the ability to handle escalations faster and so on, we've essentially put in some incremental risk -- or tried to account for some incremental risk in our overall execution.\n Clearly, the environment is very fluid by country. And so we have to be sensitive to navigate through that. There is a component of supply chain. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about our supply chain positioning. So it's mostly more about the general uncertainty and what we're having to do operationally to deal with it. \nHarlan Sur: Okay. Great. And then congrats on the 300 basis points of share gain in process control last year. I think now you're about 5x larger than your nearest competitor. On your commentary on the sustainability of process control intensity for this year, where are you seeing the biggest sustainable increases of this intensity? Is it China and NAND? Or is it just across all of the sectors given rising complexity? And then it also looks like your large logic customer is executing and finally getting back to sort of this 2-, 2.5-year cadence on node migrations after a long pause and much reuse. How does this also change your longer-term view on intensity for the team? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think that the biggest difference we see right now, I think, in the process control intensity is the realization that EUV and those in support of it really need more capability. And specifically, we've talked about Gen5 in the past being used for print check, and that's definitely driving adoption.\n In addition, we believe the sustainability is there based on new products that we introduced that we outlined in our Investor Day. And so it's really not one particular customer. It's really now we have Gen5 is really humming at every major customer and is growing in adoption. And maybe in the last couple of years, we went from being in the development phase to people actually expanding their footprint with that.\n But we also saw strength in laser scanning. And so I think even optical metrology, we mentioned in there, it's really pretty broad-based across the portfolio. And I do think in times like this, even if customers are going to back off capacity, which could happen later in the year, they're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow them to bring out new technologies, which is always favorable for process control. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Glad to hear that everyone is doing well. I guess, Bren, I want to go back to just the COVID-19 impact and whether or not you have a number that quantifies the March quarter impact. And was it an impact to shipments and rev rec or just rev rec? And I guess is the broader range for June just a realization that you're expecting the impact to be larger in the June quarter than the March quarter? \nBren Higgins: So John, on March, when we go back to when we gave guidance, we certainly felt that there would be some potential risk of pushout related to tools that were going into the affected areas in China, particularly in Hubei province. And so we tried to account for that in our guidance and expected that independent of the COVID effect that our guidance would have been higher.\n As the quarter went along, our issues were more -- we were able to ship a little bit into that area, which was positive for us. And we had some other puts and takes across the business. The challenge we had is with quarantine periods and travel restrictions, it is taking us some time to line up resources. And if you don't have the resources for installations, customers will want to readjust some of those delivery dates. So we did have some of those issues in the quarter, and it was more shipment based than it was revenue.\n So as we look at the June quarter, though, I mean, it's a pretty challenging situation out there. And as I said in the demand -- or in the prepared remarks, I mean, demand from customers has been pretty consistent. We think that carries forward in June. And so we widened the risk to be prudent -- or the range to be prudent just given the circumstances we think we're now facing. But we did the same exercise tool by tool, and we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance. But just overall, we're learning things every day about what's going on, and so we wanted to account for some of this uncertainty that's out there. \nJohn Pitzer: And then just as my follow-up, despite the wider range for June, I think we all appreciate the fact that you're trying to give us a guidance number out there with all the puts and takes, even more so, Bren, your commentary about the full year. But I'm kind of curious. I think 90 days ago, you would have characterized calendar year '20 as sort of an above trend year for growth for you guys, trend being sort of the 7% to 9% that underpins your 2023 target model. Relative to the puts and takes you talked about in your prepared comments, should we think about 2020 as being more of a trend growth year? Or is there not enough visibility to even say that? \nBren Higgins: Well, I think the visibility question is challenging. We have peer companies that couldn't even guide the quarter given some of the challenges. So when we look at it, I mean, it's hard to believe that we wouldn't see some impact into the second half from the environment we're now operating in. We do expect, based on our current view, that it will be a growth year for the company. But as I look at it today, again, a lot of moving parts. But I would say that it would probably likely be below that trend line. Not much below, but I think it'd be below. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I had 2 of them. First one, either Bren or Rick, can you give a little bit color on the sales into China that you saw in March? What is the split between domestic and multinational and split between foundry and memory? And any kind of color into the June quarter on geography would be helpful. Then I have a follow-on. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Krish, I don't think I have it by -- broken down that way. As we said, revenue mix for China was 25%. I don't -- it's something we'll have to get back to you at this point for the March quarter. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's fine. And then the second question I had was, when you look into your June guidance, when you look at the numbers, it looks like foundry is probably slowing a bit and memory is coming back. I understand no one has a crystal ball at this point, but would you expect the trend to continue to the calendar second half? Or is it more a function of just customer CapEx spending in Q2? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I mean I think our base assumption is that we'll see stronger memory environment in the second half. Obviously, that's part that might be -- part of the business that might be more impacted by what happens in the overall economy. But our base assumption is that we would see memory recover in the second half or be stronger in the second half. Now foundry seems -- the foundry and logic seems to be pretty consistent over the course of the year, at least at this point. So I wouldn't say it's weighted to 1 half or the other right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, Bren, to go back to John's earlier question on COVID and the impact there. Can you share with us what kind of, I guess, impact to revenues you're embedding in the guide? Or should we take the midpoint as indicative of what you would do with or without indicating no supply chain issues? And then as part of the challenges around supply chain management and logistics, can you share with us what impact that might have on your cost structure as well? \nBren Higgins: So C.J., at some point, it becomes a little challenging to be -- to speculate on with and without given the environment we're operating in today and the adjustments we've had to make. If I just go back a few months, I mean, I would think that our revenue would be $100 million higher at the midpoint from a guidance perspective for the quarter in a normalized environment. Now we're far from a normalized environment and don't know when we'll get back there. So most of our adjustments, though, are related to just our ability to cadence our resources to be able to support customers.\n As we said in the prepared remarks, for the year, demand is virtually unchanged. We have seen some impact in some of the -- with customers that are closer to some consumer markets. But generally, our customers, particularly our largest customers, are still very focused on executing their plans and we're maintaining the flexibility to be as flexible as we can to respond to them. So I don't feel like I have significant supply issues to be able to make that happen, and we're running the factories to be able to respond to that.\n So they want to be in the right position to respond to their customers, and so we're managing our supply chain and our factory resources to have the flexibility to do that. If the business were to fall off in a meaningful way, of course, we're carrying a lot more resources than the -- that business level would suggest. And so there would be some adjustment required in terms of just the overall cost impact of that. But right now, that's how we're running the business, and we'll adjust as we go. We've done this before. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. If I could follow up regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're waiting clarity on how broad or narrow the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. And considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you've read today? \nRichard Wallace: Sure, C.J. I think that, to your point, it's relatively new. And we're still unpacking it. And as we said, we're working to gain clarity. But our understanding at this point is this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have 3 major manufacturing sites: Israel, Singapore and here. So there's a potential impact depending on the customer in our final understanding of the ruling that will impact tools that come out of California.\n But even that, based on the words we had and the comments we made, it's still unclear. And we're getting guidance on that and actually working through it. So we haven't been able to come up with more than that at this point. But we still -- as we look to the year, we feel -- as Bren said, we understand that risk and potential risk, and we feel good about the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: So sticking with this China export control, and again, I appreciate that it's somewhat earlier in the process. But I think you mentioned you already restrict shipments for military end use. So I'm curious, what else do you need to do to satisfy these new requirements, right? Whether or not you ship the end product from the U.S. or from overseas, if according to you, you're not shipping something for military end use, what more do you need to do? Like what is the mechanical process, I mean, going and asking for a license if you are not shipping anything for a military end use already? \nRichard Wallace: So there's a couple of aspects of this as we understand it, but one of them is a rigorous process we're going through to make sure we understand the intent and the -- how to execute on this rule. And we're working with outside counsel, inside counsel to do that. And as we said, we already have some of the constraints. This was a broad policy, not simply about semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor equipment just happens to be included in this.\n So we will work through that process. But that is why we say that we already take steps to handle some of the questions that are being put forward, and we will continue to work through it. When we have more clarity -- and frankly, the rule is still -- there's still a period where further definition is happening until the end of June. So once we have more clarity, of course, we're going to share that. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, I'm curious, what have you seen from a demand perspective and just from any supply chain issues in the first few weeks of the quarter? Because just from the outside looking at it, it seems as if, right, there are expectations that second half would get better, that macro conditions could improve, that people are slowly starting to get back. That's why I'm curious, but is it fair to say that June is the trough for the year? Just what -- how would you characterize what you have seen for the first few weeks of the quarter from a demand and a supply perspective? \nRichard Wallace: So I think Bren -- this is Rick. Bren talked about the demand, but I'll give some color to it. I've had a number of conversations with customers. And I would say that everyone is continuing with their plan. The notable exception, as Bren mentioned, consumer facing and anybody that's dealing directly, for example, with automobile, I think that's an area where there's been constraint. But it's been compensated for by some of our other customers who actually see increase in demand driven by some of the work-from-home trends. So I think that in balance, we're seeing that.\n The supply chain actually got better in terms of some of the supply that we had in Asia, specifically China, where coming out of Chinese New Year, part of what we weren't sure about was the supply chain that we had in China, how effective they were going to be and how efficient. That's fully recovered, and we're back actually above the level of supply for some of those parts. And we've pretty definitely moved through the different opportunities for supply, and we feel very good about our ability to navigate that. As Bren said, it's not easy, but we're confident of our ability to do it.\n So we don't really see a reason to change it. So then what we're backing up to is what are the macro implications of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. And since we don't have a way to really understand that long term because I don't think anybody really knows, we just model different scenarios for what that might look like. But we have no leading indicators right now of any real change in behavior. \nBren Higgins: Yes. And just an additional point here is the internal forecast would suggest that the second half is stronger. I think the challenge we have to Rick's point is what ultimately happens with our customers' demand profile and what that means to supply. Now there are lead times with -- and so on, and those issues are things that customers have to contemplate as they think about how they're managing their capacity. But that's essentially where we're at. So we'll have to see how that plays out, what that ultimately means to them and then ultimately what that means to their demand for our products.\n We do have a certain amount of investment that happens in supporting technology road maps. Those are continuing on a normalized pace. And so we would expect that for products that are particularly focused on enabling technology transitions that those products would be more resilient than more capacity-centric products depending on one environment. But I'm not ready to call a trough here in the June quarter until we get better visibility about what ultimately thing -- how things will look in the September quarter is, I think, one of the challenges that we're facing here.\n We don't talk about it very much, but I think that the way we manage the supply chain is a competitive advantage for KLA. We talk about our operating model, and a lot of that has to do with how we manage supply chains, how we run our factories. We work with suppliers that provide very high end capability for us, and we engage very closely with them. We buy parts earlier. We commit earlier. So we're able to navigate through, certainly for key components, potential disruptions and working with them to make sure they're in a place to be able to support us in whatever environment we might end up in.\n We have the service business. It's very contract based. The products live a long time. So having extra parts from time to time is the least of my concerns generally as a CFO running this company. So I think that, that situation works for us. And with the extension of demand in terms of how it's affecting, how long products are living, we tend to work our way through the parts that we do have. So it slows down inventory turns, but it is fundamental to the operating model of the company. And I think the margin profile reflects that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I also wanted to ask on the Commerce changes. It certainly looks like you have some cover on the direct product rule for the stuff being made outside the U.S. when you sort of look through the CCL list and at the ECCN categorizations. But the language around end use and end user seems to be very ambiguous. And I guess -- we obviously hope to get clear interpretation from Commerce before June 29. But the experts that I've talked to indicate that it's sort of purposely ambiguous. So I guess the question is, if you have to apply when in doubt, would you agree that the risk might be more on the foundry/logic side and less on the memory side? \nBren Higgins: Tim, I think it's too early to speculate. I mean I -- yes, it's too early to speculate. \nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, Bren, I guess, a follow-up on the impairment. So 15% of the acquired goodwill was written down. So can you just quantify, did that have any impact on the sort of long-term growth prospect for the Orbotech businesses? Or do you think that even though that was written down that long-term numbers that were put into the model at Analyst Day still hold? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Tim, as you know, these are asset-light businesses. And so there's a fair amount of purchase consideration that shows up in goodwill. And what that reflects really is when you do valuations, as we all know, and you do a discounted cash flow that -- as cash flows push out and what discount rates you use have an effect on ultimate value. Certainly, in the near term, in some of those businesses, if you look at the specialty semiconductor business, being impacted by trade last year and some of the automotive dynamics into this year, that did affect some of our near-term focus -- forecast. So over the long run -- and then I think the second part is around flat panel where we saw -- we expected to see more recovery in flat panel CapEx into '20, and we're not seeing that.\n So there were some modest adjustments related to COVID and some of these issues that I mentioned and then just the general uncertainty in terms of how that affects an ultimate discount rate that you use. But to be clear, we do feel very comfortable with the growth rate trajectory that we presented at Investor Day back in September. And it's really a function of the things I talked about, just given the uncertainty of the current environment that we're operating in. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. \nQuinn Bolton: Bren, just wanted to ask on the gross margin. You guided 59% to 61%. Wondering if there's any impact from spacing requirements and social distancing on that manufacturing capacity or your cycle times within your own facilities. \nBren Higgins: Yes. That's a good question. I mean in our facilities, most of our builds are bay builds, and so we're able to comply with some of the social distancing challenges there pretty effectively. So it's not really related to that. I think from a cycle time point of view, we're executing generally in line with our plans.\n Quarter-to-quarter, it's really more around just some of the mix of products that we expect to see this quarter versus last quarter. And the service profitability levels were particularly strong last quarter, I think, with some of the delays in just activity out there and so how that affected our cost structure. So I would expect some of those costs to come back as we move into this quarter.\n So overall, it was a little bit richer than we expected in the March quarter, and we're seeing some adjustment into the June quarter. But the long-term view at the current sort of expected revenue levels is to see gross margins between 60% and 61%, with the biggest factor being mostly around the mix of products. \nQuinn Bolton: Great. And then a follow-up question. You mentioned the 3 main manufacturing sites: Israel, Singapore and U.S. Wondering if you have redundant capacity to build the same tool at multiple sites. And if you don't have that capacity today, does the export control action and just the COVID outbreak make you rethink whether having redundant manufacturing capacity is -- would be part of a long-term 3- to 5-year plan? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. We have definitely the ability -- the similarity in what we do in these different sites allow us some flexibility, which over time has caused us actually to transition more to the sites out of the U.S. in both the case of Israel and also in Singapore. So that's something that we're always evaluating in terms of our ability and flexibility to manufacture different products in different locations based on customer needs, supply chain and our staffing. So of course, that's a lever and an option that we have as we look out and think about where the best place to be positioned is. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Yes. Looks like you're thinking about a nice sequential increase in implied memory revenue for the June quarter. I was wondering, can you help us understand the drivers of that? Is it more of a market recovery? Or are there also some kind of embedded assumptions around new product shipments that you've launched recently? \nRichard Wallace: It's funny, I went back and I looked at -- if you looked at the March quarter revenue levels for memory, it was probably our lowest since about 2016. So in some ways, there was a bit of a trough there in terms of just the overall business level for memory. So we do see a pickup. The pickup is pretty balanced across the -- it's about 50-50 overall of what we expect in the quarter from flash and DRAM. So I wouldn't say it's related to anything in particular other than just we're seeing a stronger revenue profile this quarter versus a very low one last quarter. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Okay. And then just on the record backlog, when we think about your comments around the long-term target for growth rate for 2020, how do we think about the backlog covering that relative to prior years? \nRichard Wallace: Well, we have record backlog today. So we had a very strong order quarter, record backlog this quarter. So that certainly gives us some comfort. I mean customer demand is there. We have the backlog. We have the parts. So as I said, we're in a position where we can deliver to any scenario. So we feel pretty confident about that. But we really just have to see where our customers are ultimately in what they do. But certainly, the backlog does give us confidence really across the businesses to -- with a certain expectation.\n But again, depending on what happens with their business, then sometimes they do push dates and things like that. But given the lead time for our products, the backlog gives us some comfort about what we see in front of us over the next 6 months or so. \nBren Higgins: I think, John, as you think about the longer term, the 2023 plan, the biggest variable in that from our standpoint is really what happens in the macro economy because when we look at all the trends that we've said, the new products, the market share, the secular dynamics, everything is really working the way we had envisioned. And we're executing -- and we feel really great about that. What we can't forecast at this point is how deep and how long any kind of economic disruption is. So that's the thing that will really ultimately determine the pace of the overall industry.\n I do think that there are aspects of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry that are actually going to do quite well. So unlike general recessions we've had or the '08, '09, there's aspects of what we do that are enabling people to actually continue to function through this time period. But ultimately, if there's macroeconomic shock, it's going to -- depending on how long it goes, it will alter those plans in terms of the length of the time it will take to come out of this. And that's the thing we're in no position to forecast. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call over back to the presenters. \nRichard Wallace: Thank you very much, and we appreciate everybody tuning in today. We look forward to chatting with you going forward. This ends the call. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you all for joining us today in these extraordinary times. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.\n KLA delivered strong results in the March 2020 quarter. Revenue finished at the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint of the guidance range, demonstrating strong demand from our customers and exceptional execution across our global KLA operations. KLA's performance in the March quarter highlights how the company's operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a strong and resilient framework to guide our execution and consistently deliver on our commitments even during unprecedented challenges.\n In our prepared remarks today, we will discuss how KLA's unique and sustainable competitive advantages helped us consistently deliver strong relative results, while showcasing the enduring strength of the KLA investment thesis. We will also discuss how KLA is positioned to confidently navigate through these periods of uncertainty.\n To lead off, I want to highlight KLA's priorities and actions in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Please turn to Slide 4. First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our partners. We began taking proactive measures for our teams as soon as we saw the outbreak begin in China, including immediately eliminating nonessential travel, canceling our annual sales conference, our global engineering conference as well as the KLA Lithography Users Forum at SPIE.\n A large percentage of our workforce is in China and the Pacific region, and we initiated a global crisis management team to ensure we had insight into needs and activities at the local levels to provide assistance as needed. As information and shelter-in-place orders began to roll out across the globe, we prioritized rapid communications to our employees. And we immediately instituted guidelines and policies to ensure that our essential workforce could operate in safe conditions, and we remain focused on that daily.\n Specifically, as our teams worldwide have largely had to shift to working from home, we worked hard to maintain our ability to support our customers in this unique scenario. At our manufacturing facilities, we have focused on creating a significantly reduced employee footprint. We have rigorous social distancing and cleaning guidelines and health checks to allow our teams to be safe while staying on track with shipping, installing and delivering the essential services we provide to our customers.\n I'd like to personally commend our global team for their resourcefulness and commitment to executing under these challenging circumstances. Our customer feedback has been outstanding. And our business is healthy and performing well under unprecedented conditions. I'm really proud of the way we as a company have responded to these challenges. It really reflects the extraordinary strength of our teams guided by the KLA core values of perseverance, drive to be better, high-performing teams and indispensability.\n For our global employee base, we recognize that this crisis also extends well beyond the disruption to their work life. And we're focusing on continuing to ensure that we can support them in any way that we can.\n I'd also like to note that we took action to support our communities by creating a KLA Foundation Global Relief Fund, where we committed $2 million in global relief efforts to benefit local nonprofit organizations, which are working in areas identified as having a high number of affected individuals and with those who are with high-risk populations in Asia, Europe, Israel and the United States. Above all, we remain advocates for the holistic health and safety of our employees as well as the communities they work and live in.\n Turn now to Slide 5 for some comments on the industry demand environment. Though we were encouraged to see many of our customers in China return to full production late in the quarter, COVID-19 has already impacted global economic growth. The question remains whether it will result in a short-term pushout in global demand supported by substantial levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments or whether it leads to long-term demand decline followed by an elongated recovery. Many economic prognosticators now expect a global recession as the effects of business disruption, rising unemployment and reduction in consumer spending are felt across the global economy.\n So at KLA, we're not predicting the depth or duration of this impact until we have more evidence about the evolution of the crisis. But if there's one thing we do know, it's the situation is rapidly evolving. And at this stage, the full impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand and the global economy remains unclear. But from our point of view, although the semiconductor equipment industry is currently supply-constrained, customer demand remains strong in the first half of 2020. And to underscore that point, KLA delivered record shipments of our semiconductor process control systems during the quarter, and total backlog finished at record levels exiting March.\n It's also important to point out that KLA is most levered to our customers' strategic R&D investments and their product road maps for leading-edge technologies across foundry, logic and memory. Our customers use these investments as critical to their long-term growth strategies and their competitive positioning. And therefore, they tend to be more resilient.\n Now in the near and medium term, we see increased semiconductor device demands for enterprise and cloud applications in response to the surge in work from home and a pickup in gaming. Now this is somewhat offset by a decline in some consumer-facing end markets. We also see strong results in our specialty semiconductor markets with demand driven by 5G infrastructure investment, particularly in China. We're fulfilling urgent requests to supply products essential in MEMS manufacturing and power technologies focused on medical applications such as smart thermometers and ventilators, which are directly addressing the crisis.\n It's clear health care will be one of the many industries which will be profoundly impacted with the acceleration of technology implementation, virtual capabilities and automation. We know that KLA is not immune to the impact this crisis may have on customers' capital investment plans over the next several months. However, we do draw some confidence from the historical evidence that our customers tend to maintain their investment in next-generation development in times of semiconductor industry contraction and uncertainty, which makes KLA's revenue more resilient in times like this.\n As an example, I'd point out that in 2019, according to the recent Gartner market share analysis, total WFE investment was estimated to decline about 6%, but KLA semiconductor process control business grew at 1%. Taking a step back even further, it's worth highlighting that KLA's business has always declined less than the industry in periods of general contraction.\n Also, KLA's service business, which accounts for roughly 1/4 of our total revenues today and has strong and growing profitability, also tends to demonstrate exceptional resilience throughout the business cycle, given the unique nature of our service model with 70% to 75% of the revenue being subscription-like contracts.\n Given the continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our market leadership and strong balance sheet, KLA is in a very strong position to navigate this period of uncertainty and to capitalize on opportunities to drive long-term growth for our industry once the conditions eventually normalize. Even though we couldn't have anticipated what we're experiencing today, we believe that secular factors driving the industry demand and our 2023 revenue and EPS targets remain largely intact, and they'll drive diversified growth with operating leverage over the long term.\n Finally, in many ways, the global response to COVID-19 is accelerating secular drivers of the industry growth that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. And that gives us strong optimism that we and our industry will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. We always knew we had compelling secular growth trends a year ago, but if anything, these trends will be stronger and more important going forward. Whether it's the move to Industry 4.0 or factory automation, the rising semiconductor content in automobiles, remote medical diagnostics and care, 5G, ubiquitous connectivity supported by continued data center build-outs or new, more capable handset offerings, the new work-from-home reality or the overall acceleration of digitization and move to the data era, everything will depend on advancing semiconductor technology that KLA helps to make possible.\n Please turn to Slide 6 and 7 for a review of the KLA operating model and our strategic objectives. As in prior industry downturns, one thing that remains a constant, serving as our guide as we manage through this uncertainty, is the KLA operating model. This codifies our corporate values and management principles and defines the critical core competencies that drive our performance and represents a solid and enduring framework for the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. The KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy. It ties accountability to results, ensures product development execution and facilitates continuous improvement, while ensuring the company always operates with strong financial discipline while driving long-term performance and profitability objectives.\n As we indicated during our September 2019 Investor Day, we're also leveraging the KLA operating model to strengthen the performance of new businesses. We have recently reorganized the former Orbotech units under the leadership of long-term KLA Executive Vice President Oreste Donzella, creating the new Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group. This new organization will help drive synergies and growth across the broad electronics value chain, including specialty semiconductors, packaging, printed circuit boards and flat panel display.\n Guided by this and with our global team's experience navigating through various industry cycles and downturns over the years, we have the benefit of history and the processes in place to maintain a high level of investment, which is critical to our market leadership and our customers' technology road map, while at the same time, protecting and preserving operating margins.\n Please turn to Slide 8 for the March quarter 2020 business highlights. In closing, I'd like to mention 4 highlights that stood out this quarter. First, as I mentioned at the outset, KLA achieved record company-wide shipments driven by record shipments in our Semiconductor Process Control segment, and we ended March with record backlog. This illustrates the overall momentum we are having in the marketplace across various product platforms with particular strength in mask inspection, patterned optical inspection and films metrology. And it further shores up our confidence in the long-term future growth position for the company.\n Secondly, we're really pleased to see KLA's customer success being further validated by third-party market share analysis from Gartner. KLA's market leadership is the result of ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiated products and a portfolio of products and solutions that address the most critical process control market challenges. And we're pleased once again to see the success of our strategy being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions.\n The report shows that process control grew as a percent of overall WFE, and KLA strengthened its process control market leadership by gaining 2.5 points of market share. The past year marked a record or new record demand in KLA's core franchises such as optical wafer inspection, overlay metrology and mask inspection. This data also shows KLA's first meaningful revenue in e-beam inspection since 2015. We expect the process control intensity will continue to stay at a similar level in calendar 2020 or better and that KLA will maintain our market leadership, driven by an expanding EUV investment environment as well as advanced technology development in memory and continued semiconductor industry expansion in China.\n Third, we saw continued strength in both foundry and logic. Foundry and logic revenue grew sequentially as customers accelerated the ramp of both 7- and 5-nanometer nodes and continue to prioritize their leading-edge technology road maps.\n And finally, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and steady free cash flow in calendar 2020 despite all the uncertainty. Total KLA service revenue rose to $373 million, thanks to the continued growth of our Semiconductor Process Control installed base as well as the expanding service businesses from recent acquisitions.\n Please turn to Slide 9 for my concluding thoughts. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Bren, we're in extraordinary times. And in that, we're facing both unprecedented uncertainties as well as opportunities. But amidst this background, one thing that's not changing is KLA's strong fundamentals. And we're confident that our strategies and the actions we're taking today will continue to lead us in the right direction and position us to emerge even stronger and more resilient.\n KLA's March quarter indicates the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We expect to be able to continue to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while protecting operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our capital return strategies. As I stated earlier, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to preserve the health and safety of our employees and their families. We believe that this is a new reality, and we're going to be in this for some time, but we're confident we can work together to get through it and continue to deliver in the way we know how.\n I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bren, to discuss our financial results and guidance. Bren? Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think that the biggest difference we see right now, I think, in the process control intensity is the realization that EUV and those in support of it really need more capability. And specifically, we've talked about Gen5 in the past being used for print check, and that's definitely driving adoption.\n In addition, we believe the sustainability is there based on new products that we introduced that we outlined in our Investor Day. And so it's really not one particular customer. It's really now we have Gen5 is really humming at every major customer and is growing in adoption. And maybe in the last couple of years, we went from being in the development phase to people actually expanding their footprint with that.\n But we also saw strength in laser scanning. And so I think even optical metrology, we mentioned in there, it's really pretty broad-based across the portfolio. And I do think in times like this, even if customers are going to back off capacity, which could happen later in the year, they're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow them to bring out new technologies, which is always favorable for process control. Sure, C.J. I think that, to your point, it's relatively new. And we're still unpacking it. And as we said, we're working to gain clarity. But our understanding at this point is this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have 3 major manufacturing sites: Israel, Singapore and here. So there's a potential impact depending on the customer in our final understanding of the ruling that will impact tools that come out of California.\n But even that, based on the words we had and the comments we made, it's still unclear. And we're getting guidance on that and actually working through it. So we haven't been able to come up with more than that at this point. But we still -- as we look to the year, we feel -- as Bren said, we understand that risk and potential risk, and we feel good about the year. So there's a couple of aspects of this as we understand it, but one of them is a rigorous process we're going through to make sure we understand the intent and the -- how to execute on this rule. And we're working with outside counsel, inside counsel to do that. And as we said, we already have some of the constraints. This was a broad policy, not simply about semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor equipment just happens to be included in this.\n So we will work through that process. But that is why we say that we already take steps to handle some of the questions that are being put forward, and we will continue to work through it. When we have more clarity -- and frankly, the rule is still -- there's still a period where further definition is happening until the end of June. So once we have more clarity, of course, we're going to share that. So I think Bren -- this is Rick. Bren talked about the demand, but I'll give some color to it. I've had a number of conversations with customers. And I would say that everyone is continuing with their plan. The notable exception, as Bren mentioned, consumer facing and anybody that's dealing directly, for example, with automobile, I think that's an area where there's been constraint. But it's been compensated for by some of our other customers who actually see increase in demand driven by some of the work-from-home trends. So I think that in balance, we're seeing that.\n The supply chain actually got better in terms of some of the supply that we had in Asia, specifically China, where coming out of Chinese New Year, part of what we weren't sure about was the supply chain that we had in China, how effective they were going to be and how efficient. That's fully recovered, and we're back actually above the level of supply for some of those parts. And we've pretty definitely moved through the different opportunities for supply, and we feel very good about our ability to navigate that. As Bren said, it's not easy, but we're confident of our ability to do it.\n So we don't really see a reason to change it. So then what we're backing up to is what are the macro implications of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. And since we don't have a way to really understand that long term because I don't think anybody really knows, we just model different scenarios for what that might look like. But we have no leading indicators right now of any real change in behavior. Yes, it's a great question. We have definitely the ability -- the similarity in what we do in these different sites allow us some flexibility, which over time has caused us actually to transition more to the sites out of the U.S. in both the case of Israel and also in Singapore. So that's something that we're always evaluating in terms of our ability and flexibility to manufacture different products in different locations based on customer needs, supply chain and our staffing. So of course, that's a lever and an option that we have as we look out and think about where the best place to be positioned is. It's funny, I went back and I looked at -- if you looked at the March quarter revenue levels for memory, it was probably our lowest since about 2016. So in some ways, there was a bit of a trough there in terms of just the overall business level for memory. So we do see a pickup. The pickup is pretty balanced across the -- it's about 50-50 overall of what we expect in the quarter from flash and DRAM. So I wouldn't say it's related to anything in particular other than just we're seeing a stronger revenue profile this quarter versus a very low one last quarter. Well, we have record backlog today. So we had a very strong order quarter, record backlog this quarter. So that certainly gives us some comfort. I mean customer demand is there. We have the backlog. We have the parts. So as I said, we're in a position where we can deliver to any scenario. So we feel pretty confident about that. But we really just have to see where our customers are ultimately in what they do. But certainly, the backlog does give us confidence really across the businesses to -- with a certain expectation.\n But again, depending on what happens with their business, then sometimes they do push dates and things like that. But given the lead time for our products, the backlog gives us some comfort about what we see in front of us over the next 6 months or so. Thank you very much, and we appreciate everybody tuning in today. We look forward to chatting with you going forward. This ends the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 11 for quarterly financial highlights. KLA delivered a solid quarter in March with revenue at the midpoint and non-GAAP EPS finishing at the upper end of the company's guidance ranges. \n Total revenue was $1.424 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 59.5% to 61.5%, driven by a richer product mix than was modeled at the beginning of the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.47. At the guided tax planning rate of 13%, EPS would have been $2.52. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS includes an impairment of goodwill of $257 million and a $22.5 million loss related to the extinguishment of our November '21 notes that we refinanced in a new bond offering in February.\n Let me briefly provide more context on the goodwill impairment. During the March quarter, and consistent with our policy, KLA conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment based on the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. Given the uncertainty of the current environment and the associated unknown long-run trajectory of economic growth, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $257 million in the third quarter to write down a portion of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Orbotech acquisition.\n Before going into further detail on quarterly results, I want to echo Rick's comments and say that while the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and presents new challenges to running our business, one thing remains clear. KLA has a resilient business model underpinned by a rock-solid investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis.\n Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and our recent bond offering and refinancing means that we are in a great position and don't have any bond maturities until late 2024. To further expand on that point, I want to highlight that in February, KLA issued $750 million and 3.3% 30-year bonds to redeem $500 million in aggregate principal amount 4.125% senior notes due in November of 2021. And S&P upgraded our credit rating one notch earlier in the quarter to BBB+.\n Given our solid balance sheet and consistently robust free cash flow that our business generates, we believe KLA has enough cash and liquidity to respond to any operating condition, while still being able to execute our long-term strategies, invest at a high level in new capabilities across our product portfolio and maintain our well-articulated capital returns approach, which includes our current $3.40 annual per share dividend.\n Regarding capital management and deployment, as you would expect, we are reviewing all operating expenses and capital expenditure plans to prioritize and optimize them given the current business conditions and economic environment. One thing is certain. We remain committed to returning 70% or more free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases.\n In March, we were consistent with our long-standing capital return framework, returning 113% of quarterly free cash flow to investors, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend distributions and $316 million in repurchases of common stock. KLA currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\n Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 for the breakdown of revenue by segments, end markets, products and regions. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, which includes associated service business, was healthy at $1.18 billion. Foundry was once again very strong in March at approximately 55% of Semi Process Control revenue, up from 52% last quarter. Memory was 31% in March, down from 40%. Logic was 14% versus 8% last quarter.\n Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment was $85 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by strength in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $160 million, down 14% sequentially and slightly below our internal plans as these businesses, which are closer to consumer markets, softened somewhat as we moved through the quarter.\n Now for the breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, starting with the distribution of revenue by major product category. Wafer inspection was 38%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 21%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the Semiconductor Process Control segment. Specialty Semiconductor Process was 5%. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 7%. Service was 26% of revenue in the quarter and other was 3%.\n The regional split of revenue was as follows: China was 25%. Taiwan was 24%. Korea was 21%. The U.S. and Japan were 11% each. Europe, including Israel, was 5%. And the rest of Asia was 3%.\n Please turn to Slide 14 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $378 million, including $215 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were modestly below our targets for the quarter, with the largest delta to plan coming from lower travel and entertainment expenses and a slower hiring pace than was originally planned. Operating margin was 34.6%. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $38 million.\n The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% and above the company's long-term tax planning rate of 13% due to negative capital market impact on expense deductions in the company's employee deferred compensation program. Going forward, based on the company's expectations for geographic distribution of profit, you should continue to use 13% as a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $389 million, and the company had approximately 157 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n Turning now to a review of our balance sheet and free cash flow on Slides 15 and 16. KLA ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.\n Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong, coming in at $442 million and $399 million, respectively. Free cash flow margin was 28%, and the annualized free cash flow yield was above 6%. For a frame of reference, over the last 10 years, KLA's free cash flow margin averaged 25%. KLA's business model generates strong free cash flow and is very resilient across the various phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the past 5 years, the company has averaged 98% free cash flow conversion.\n Please turn to Slide 17 for a snapshot of our capital return activities. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchase shares being roughly $73, with approximately $4.1 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010.\n Now for our June 2020 guidance on Slide 18. I will start by saying we have mitigated the supply chain issues related to COVID-19 that arose over the past quarter, but fluidity related to this situation makes it a daily challenge to manage as countries around the world handle their respective coronavirus responses. The uncertainties and added complexity associated with global social distancing policies, such as travel restrictions and mandated quarantine periods, continue to pose challenges to our ability to install and support KLA systems.\n Accordingly, we have taken extra measures to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain. Somewhat unique to KLA's business model are longer material lead times and volume hedging strategies that -- to enable flexibility with key components in our products, which slows inventory velocity but allows us to weather short-term disruptions in supply. For short lead time parts, we maintain dual supplier strategies, mostly with suppliers in different countries to optimize capital commitments and ensure we can shift supply to maintain flexibility to meet fluid customer delivery schedules.\n In addition, our customers rely on KLA to enable their long-term technology development programs, which tend to be sustained and protected in periods of short-term demand uncertainty and disruption, such as we are currently experiencing. We continue to maintain close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply chain pressure points, and we remain confident today in our ability to meet our demand and to be able to continue to service and support our customers in the field.\n KLA is managing this situation with both determination and creativity. We have fully mobilized our teams and are taking action to minimize disruption in our operations, meet essential customer needs and maintain the resilience of our supply chain to limit the overall impact of COVID-19 across our business.\n Given the scale of our worldwide service and support infrastructure, we are supporting our customers with local resources and are executing well. However, it is taking longer in some cases to complete rigorous acceptance criteria for certain products without the support of our factory-centric teams. In all cases, we've done our best to contemplate these factors in our guidance, including the broader range of guidance in our June quarter outlook, which is as follows. Total revenue for the June quarter is expected to be in a range of $1.26 billion to $1.54 billion. Foundry is forecasted to be about 51% of Semi Process Control system revenue, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. Memory is expected to be approximately 39%. Logic is expected to be about 10% of Semiconductor Process Control system revenue.\n We forecast gross margin to be in a range of 59% to 61% as product mix is modestly less favorable and slightly higher costs are expected in our service business than in the March quarter. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13%.\n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.58 to $2.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.87. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 156 million shares.\n For my financial conclusion, please turn to Slide 19. I'd like to share our perspective on the demand environment for the balance of the year 2020. First, I'd like to address the new export rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, which will go into effect on June 29, 2020. Those rules will expand export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that have operations that could support military end uses even if the item sold by the U.S. companies are used for civilian purposes only.\n On this issue, I would note that the new rules do not impact the majority of our business as most of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. I would also like to point out that we routinely ensure that our products are not used for prohibited military end uses in China. However, the question remains today whether these new rules, when enacted, would make it more difficult to ship to certain customers in China that might be deemed military end users under the new rules as a result of their potential activities supporting military end uses.\n We are still assessing the new rules and working with trade associations and others to obtain additional guidance from the U.S. government regarding the scope and practical application of these new rules. Once we have clarity on how these rules will be implemented, we can better determine the impact on our business, if any, in the second half of the calendar year.\n Notwithstanding this recent trade issue, our outlook for customer demand in the Semiconductor Process Control business is virtually unchanged today from what we expected in February. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our supply chain in our factories to meet current customer expectations for deliveries. However, we do expect that the overall macroeconomic environment will put pressure at some point on some of our customers' demand for products in certain segments and ultimately could affect their capacity investment plans, both in magnitude and timing.\n Obviously, the depth and duration of this impact is unknown today, so we will continue to run our business to maintain the flexibility to respond to any demand scenario. We do expect our customers to continue to progress their technology road maps across all segments, and KLA products are critical to those transitions. We expect investments to continue in this area at a normalized pace, independent of the macro environment.\n For our more consumer-centric businesses, we have seen some weakness over the course of the March quarter. And while we are well positioned, we would expect some impact to these businesses compared to what we thought in early February.\n Finally, collaboration across global teams and partners on large-scale product development programs without direct in-person engagement is creating some execution challenges, and while early, could put pressure on release dates for new products expected over the next 12 months.\n To summarize, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, KLA continues to be well positioned to navigate the uncharted territory we find ourselves in. We derive our strength from our strong balance sheet and liquidity and comfort from not having any bond maturities until late in 2024. Our strong operating performance helps us prioritize critical investments across our technology portfolio and protects our margins while simultaneously generating strong and consistent free cash flow.\n Our market position has never been stronger. Despite the usual competitive noise, our share gain and improving process control intensity serve as validation that our products -- our portfolio of products and solutions are adding critical value to our customers' technology road map differentiation and their ability to yield these new technologies at production volumes.\n How we allocate capital has never been more important. You can be assured, we will continue to make smart capital allocation decisions, continue to invest in the important R&D to support our customers and new product launches, fuel our long-term growth strategy, maintain our ongoing dividend strategy and preserve our ability to be opportunistic with our buyback program to fully deploy the free cash flow of the company.\n Lastly, predictability and business model resiliency matter more now than ever. Our growing diversification, significant exposure to our customers' critical process technology transitions, our subscription-like service revenue stream and our focus on driving operating leverage are key attributes of our business model. We are confident we can continue to excel in managing these areas and position KLA for a brighter future.\n Before we begin the Q&A, just a reminder that KLA will participate in many virtual investor webcasted conferences this quarter. Please keep an eye out for notice of future event scheduling, and we look forward to seeing some of you virtually later in the quarter.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kessel to begin the Q&A. Harlan, it's Bren. I hope you're doing well. So the bias is more around just the operational constraints. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are having to support the tools with our local teams, particularly around installations, and that can take a little bit longer. And as a result of that and the ability to handle escalations faster and so on, we've essentially put in some incremental risk -- or tried to account for some incremental risk in our overall execution.\n Clearly, the environment is very fluid by country. And so we have to be sensitive to navigate through that. There is a component of supply chain. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about our supply chain positioning. So it's mostly more about the general uncertainty and what we're having to do operationally to deal with it. So John, on March, when we go back to when we gave guidance, we certainly felt that there would be some potential risk of pushout related to tools that were going into the affected areas in China, particularly in Hubei province. And so we tried to account for that in our guidance and expected that independent of the COVID effect that our guidance would have been higher.\n As the quarter went along, our issues were more -- we were able to ship a little bit into that area, which was positive for us. And we had some other puts and takes across the business. The challenge we had is with quarantine periods and travel restrictions, it is taking us some time to line up resources. And if you don't have the resources for installations, customers will want to readjust some of those delivery dates. So we did have some of those issues in the quarter, and it was more shipment based than it was revenue.\n So as we look at the June quarter, though, I mean, it's a pretty challenging situation out there. And as I said in the demand -- or in the prepared remarks, I mean, demand from customers has been pretty consistent. We think that carries forward in June. And so we widened the risk to be prudent -- or the range to be prudent just given the circumstances we think we're now facing. But we did the same exercise tool by tool, and we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance. But just overall, we're learning things every day about what's going on, and so we wanted to account for some of this uncertainty that's out there. Well, I think the visibility question is challenging. We have peer companies that couldn't even guide the quarter given some of the challenges. So when we look at it, I mean, it's hard to believe that we wouldn't see some impact into the second half from the environment we're now operating in. We do expect, based on our current view, that it will be a growth year for the company. But as I look at it today, again, a lot of moving parts. But I would say that it would probably likely be below that trend line. Not much below, but I think it'd be below. Yes. Krish, I don't think I have it by -- broken down that way. As we said, revenue mix for China was 25%. I don't -- it's something we'll have to get back to you at this point for the March quarter. Yes. I mean I think our base assumption is that we'll see stronger memory environment in the second half. Obviously, that's part that might be -- part of the business that might be more impacted by what happens in the overall economy. But our base assumption is that we would see memory recover in the second half or be stronger in the second half. Now foundry seems -- the foundry and logic seems to be pretty consistent over the course of the year, at least at this point. So I wouldn't say it's weighted to 1 half or the other right now. So C.J., at some point, it becomes a little challenging to be -- to speculate on with and without given the environment we're operating in today and the adjustments we've had to make. If I just go back a few months, I mean, I would think that our revenue would be $100 million higher at the midpoint from a guidance perspective for the quarter in a normalized environment. Now we're far from a normalized environment and don't know when we'll get back there. So most of our adjustments, though, are related to just our ability to cadence our resources to be able to support customers.\n As we said in the prepared remarks, for the year, demand is virtually unchanged. We have seen some impact in some of the -- with customers that are closer to some consumer markets. But generally, our customers, particularly our largest customers, are still very focused on executing their plans and we're maintaining the flexibility to be as flexible as we can to respond to them. So I don't feel like I have significant supply issues to be able to make that happen, and we're running the factories to be able to respond to that.\n So they want to be in the right position to respond to their customers, and so we're managing our supply chain and our factory resources to have the flexibility to do that. If the business were to fall off in a meaningful way, of course, we're carrying a lot more resources than the -- that business level would suggest. And so there would be some adjustment required in terms of just the overall cost impact of that. But right now, that's how we're running the business, and we'll adjust as we go. We've done this before. Yes. And just an additional point here is the internal forecast would suggest that the second half is stronger. I think the challenge we have to Rick's point is what ultimately happens with our customers' demand profile and what that means to supply. Now there are lead times with -- and so on, and those issues are things that customers have to contemplate as they think about how they're managing their capacity. But that's essentially where we're at. So we'll have to see how that plays out, what that ultimately means to them and then ultimately what that means to their demand for our products.\n We do have a certain amount of investment that happens in supporting technology road maps. Those are continuing on a normalized pace. And so we would expect that for products that are particularly focused on enabling technology transitions that those products would be more resilient than more capacity-centric products depending on one environment. But I'm not ready to call a trough here in the June quarter until we get better visibility about what ultimately thing -- how things will look in the September quarter is, I think, one of the challenges that we're facing here.\n We don't talk about it very much, but I think that the way we manage the supply chain is a competitive advantage for KLA. We talk about our operating model, and a lot of that has to do with how we manage supply chains, how we run our factories. We work with suppliers that provide very high end capability for us, and we engage very closely with them. We buy parts earlier. We commit earlier. So we're able to navigate through, certainly for key components, potential disruptions and working with them to make sure they're in a place to be able to support us in whatever environment we might end up in.\n We have the service business. It's very contract based. The products live a long time. So having extra parts from time to time is the least of my concerns generally as a CFO running this company. So I think that, that situation works for us. And with the extension of demand in terms of how it's affecting, how long products are living, we tend to work our way through the parts that we do have. So it slows down inventory turns, but it is fundamental to the operating model of the company. And I think the margin profile reflects that. Tim, I think it's too early to speculate. I mean I -- yes, it's too early to speculate. Yes. Tim, as you know, these are asset-light businesses. And so there's a fair amount of purchase consideration that shows up in goodwill. And what that reflects really is when you do valuations, as we all know, and you do a discounted cash flow that -- as cash flows push out and what discount rates you use have an effect on ultimate value. Certainly, in the near term, in some of those businesses, if you look at the specialty semiconductor business, being impacted by trade last year and some of the automotive dynamics into this year, that did affect some of our near-term focus -- forecast. So over the long run -- and then I think the second part is around flat panel where we saw -- we expected to see more recovery in flat panel CapEx into '20, and we're not seeing that.\n So there were some modest adjustments related to COVID and some of these issues that I mentioned and then just the general uncertainty in terms of how that affects an ultimate discount rate that you use. But to be clear, we do feel very comfortable with the growth rate trajectory that we presented at Investor Day back in September. And it's really a function of the things I talked about, just given the uncertainty of the current environment that we're operating in. Yes. That's a good question. I mean in our facilities, most of our builds are bay builds, and so we're able to comply with some of the social distancing challenges there pretty effectively. So it's not really related to that. I think from a cycle time point of view, we're executing generally in line with our plans.\n Quarter-to-quarter, it's really more around just some of the mix of products that we expect to see this quarter versus last quarter. And the service profitability levels were particularly strong last quarter, I think, with some of the delays in just activity out there and so how that affected our cost structure. So I would expect some of those costs to come back as we move into this quarter.\n So overall, it was a little bit richer than we expected in the March quarter, and we're seeing some adjustment into the June quarter. But the long-term view at the current sort of expected revenue levels is to see gross margins between 60% and 61%, with the biggest factor being mostly around the mix of products. I think, John, as you think about the longer term, the 2023 plan, the biggest variable in that from our standpoint is really what happens in the macro economy because when we look at all the trends that we've said, the new products, the market share, the secular dynamics, everything is really working the way we had envisioned. And we're executing -- and we feel really great about that. What we can't forecast at this point is how deep and how long any kind of economic disruption is. So that's the thing that will really ultimately determine the pace of the overall industry.\n I do think that there are aspects of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry that are actually going to do quite well. So unlike general recessions we've had or the '08, '09, there's aspects of what we do that are enabling people to actually continue to function through this time period. But ultimately, if there's macroeconomic shock, it's going to -- depending on how long it goes, it will alter those plans in terms of the length of the time it will take to come out of this. And that's the thing we're in no position to forecast."

Rick?\nRick Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights. Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand. As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries. Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these. Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace. Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model. In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019.  Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond. We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership. This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques. We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses. Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day. Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren?\nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech. During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks. Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations. I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year. On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones. Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%. Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%. Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter. Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings. Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base. In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact. Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%.  Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year. For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share. With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to ensure we get as through as many questions as possible. With that Charlie, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] You first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J.Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double-digit. And based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9% - 11%. So curious is that the right math? And then as part of that what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020 presumably a year with more memory which is an obvious negative, however, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at NAND as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE both good and bad in 2020.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment. So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point.\nC.J.Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that that's much more of a second half Apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of kind of range first half second half kind of mix there.\nBrenHiggins: I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. \nHarlanSur: Good afternoon, guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year 2019. According to my calculations your services business was up about 111% and the upper end of your long term target of 9% to 11%. On your full-year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar 2020 based on your installed base growth in 2019 how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar 2020?\nBrenHiggins: So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated. I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019.\nHarlanSur: Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been draw of -- that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles right. Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example. So that then can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs like x-ray for stack profiling, e-beam both for wafer and medical maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues.\nRickWallace: Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there. So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing.\nBrenHiggins: Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020.\nRickWallace: The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. \nDavidWong: Thanks very much. Could you give us some ideas to what percent of your semi equipment sales out to domestic Chinese chipmakers?\nBrenHiggins: I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue.\nDavidWong: Okay. Great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, of course confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea about what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech?\nBrenHiggins: Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothyArcuri: Thanks a lot. So, Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019, I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875 in last September you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year, but if I add together Intel and TSMC CapEx, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there or how you sort of -- how you sort of reconcile those numbers? Thanks.\nBrenHiggins: So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019.\nTimothyArcuri: Yes, Bren. I guess I was talking second half of 2019 versus second half of 2018.\nBrenHiggins: Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 --\nTimothyArcuri: Yes. Basically --barely up.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million.\nTimothyArcuri: I guess the question is you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic so why would it be up so little when those guys CapEx is up massively. I mean it's up 30 plus percent.\nRickWallace: Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period.\nTimothyArcuri: Got it, Rick. Okay. So it's a timing issue, okay. Thanks. \nBrenHiggins: Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018.\nRickWallace: Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well.\nTimothyArcuri: Okay. Awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you --were you referring to Export Control that could come about or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? Thanks.\nRickWallace: No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Santor with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nKrishSantor: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two one. First one for either Rick or Bren. If a look at your March quarter guidance, looks like sequentially foundries up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly in an environment where people think foundry logic CapEx is front half loaded, should we assume that's how your revenues have to trend or is it tough to say at this point? And then I have a follow up.\nBrenHiggins: Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year.\nKrishSantor: Got it. And then just as a follow-up if the memory recoveries wouldn't be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile?\nBrenHiggins: There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nJohnPitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question, Bren, in your prepared comments you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the Coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious is that through the EPS as well or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, had a higher revenue midpoint.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance. So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now.\nJohnPitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow on, Rick, it's always helpful when you get kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit; your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year 2020. Wondering if you endorsed that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE and your business this year?\nRickWallace: Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance. But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended.\nBrenHiggins: John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast. But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nVivekArya: Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking a conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now, do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here or do you think that there is a chance for catch up here?\nBrenHiggins: Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe.\nRickWallace: Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now.\nVivekArya: Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that is it a difference between NAND or DRAM process control intensity?\nRickWallace: There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements. So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nToshiyaHari: Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the Coronavirus impacts. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain or have you received changes in terms of demand signals from customers or if you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative?\nRickWallace: Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details.\nBrenHiggins: But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so.\nRickWallace: And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out.\nToshiyaHari: Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half, but if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJoeQuatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looked to be in a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles. And then are those net new opportunities or are they competitive to put displacements?\nRickWallace: Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND.\nBrenHiggins: Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market. To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute.\nJoeQuatrochi: That's healthful. And then just as a quick follow up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020? I apologize I missed it. Is that still flat year-over-year?\nBrenHiggins: No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSidneyHo: Thanks for taking my question. Just to following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory CapEx recoveries more second half but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamics in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year?\nBrenHiggins: Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year.\nSidneyHo: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow up is, sorry if this has been asked earlier but last quarter you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half over half in the first half of calendar 2020. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger does that change the slope of that and assuming that the Coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year. And how should we think about first half over second half for this year?\nBrenHiggins: I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business. End of Q&A\nOperator: We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you and thank you everyone for your time and interest in KLA, today. Charlie, can you please conclude the call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights. Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand. As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries. Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these. Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace. Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model. In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019.  Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond. We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership. This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques. We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses. Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day. Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren? Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there. So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing. The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now. Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period. Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue. No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now. Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance. But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended. Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now. There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements. So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need. Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details. And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out. Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech. During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks. Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations. I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year. On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones. Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%. Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%. Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter. Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings. Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base. In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact. Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%.  Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year. For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share. With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A. Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment. So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point. I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well. So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated. I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019. Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020. I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue. Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019. Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 -- Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million. Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018. Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well. Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year. There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments. Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance. So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now. John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast. But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way. Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe. But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so. Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets. Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market. To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute. No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year. Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year. I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business. End of Q&A"

[Operator Instructions] \n Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Thank you. Sir, please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Christian, and welcome to today's KLA earnings conference call to discuss the results of the September 2019 quarter and outlook for the December 2019 quarter. I recently joined KLA, and today marks my first KLA earnings call. I'm glad to be here and look forward to meeting and talking with all of you over the quarters and years ahead. Joining me on the call are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon after the market close, and they are also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.kla.com. Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website.\n Our IR website also contains a calendar of future investor events, presentations including those from our recent Investor Day and corporate governance information as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter. \n Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance, a result of strong customer pull for KLA's solutions and focused execution, despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments.\n As a global leader in process control and supplier of process-enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges is the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations in numerous key industries. \n Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses. The KLA operating model is essential to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.\n Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have 4 objectives that serve as our guide and drive our high-performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent Investor Day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These 4 objectives are: market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence, and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses, including acquired ones, with a focus on these key 4 objectives, and it shows in our overall results published today.\n Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment. \n KLA's strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum we see due to support, both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions. Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019 at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019, with KLA's Semi Process Control business, inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018. \n Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020, as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly, and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success.\n The accelerating adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen5 demand in the near term. Also, at last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new EBEAM inspection platform in several years. I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial tool performance. KLA's differentiated EBEAM inspection platform works with Gen5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes.\n Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA. In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better-than-expected demand in the September quarter helping to contribute to the revenue upside we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology road maps.\n And finally, KLA Service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi Process Control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our Service businesses, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration, and our Service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.\n Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds and the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions, sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day.\n 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our prospects for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA, with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also marked a new record for the company. Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was $1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61%, driven by incremental revenue growth and a stronger-than-expected semi process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of $1.75 to $2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively. Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter, as both cash from operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of $496 million and $464 million. We are proud of our financial results this quarter, and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward, with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.\n A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the tenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it over time as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $228 million of common stock and also paid $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon divesting of restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced, that the Board of Directors authorized, an additional $1 billion share repurchase program resulting in $1.6 billion available to repurchase under Board authorization at quarter end.\n Please turn to Slide 11 for a review of the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Review of the semi process -- revenue for the Semi Process Control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the back of strength in foundry and logic. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 has improved modestly, driven by investments in EUV and stronger foundry demand. In addition, increased demand from native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong at approximately 44% of semi process control revenue, up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter; logic was 13% of total semi process control revenue versus 12% last quarter.\n I'll turn now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and edge solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications, like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we're encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market. Despite these near-term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis to calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was $179 million, down 3% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. \n Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows: wafer inspection was 32%; patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our Semiconductor Process Control segment; Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%; PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 9%; other, which includes bench-top analytical instruments and the KLA Pro mature products and enhancements business, was 3%; Service was 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, the U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4%, with the rest of Asia at 3%. \n Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income and expense in the September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long-term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in tax reserves related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S. Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as the long-term planning rate. Net income was $398 million, and we had 160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.\n Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past 5 years, we have averaged just over 100% free cash flow conversion. And over the last 12 months, it's been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross margins, and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion.\n Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchased shares being slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussions.\n Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially, roughly 4% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundry is forecasted to be about 55% of semi process control system revenue in the December quarter, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi process control system revenue next quarter.\n For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half. Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in a range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we are modeling NIM to be approximately $385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarter is due principally to the timing of non-headcount-related product engineering expenses for next-generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower-cost locations.\n We would expect to see an impact from these activities through 2020, with the return on these investments beginning in 2021. As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of $370 million to $375 million, as product development expenses normalize to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares.\n In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments in what remains an environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance, and we are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. \n Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or half-to-half trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment, with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019 as customers continue to progress their technology road maps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversified end demand.\n For memory, we expect a better year in 2020, and disciplined supply management in 2019 has improved the overall condition in both segments. Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control in foundry and logic, improving process control intensity in memory and contributions from new products, calendar 2020 is setting up for another year of relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we report earnings for December quarter.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] With that, Christian, we are ready for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Congratulations on the very solid results. Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] and for that to still be a good growth driver in 2020. So I guess, I'm trying to get a sense from you, where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time do you think we are? Maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it. And as you think about logic/foundry being strong next year, to what extent is that just a call on laundry -- on logic/foundry CapEx versus perhaps a Gen5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating? \nRichard Wallace: Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think if I thought about Gen5 right now and you want to use baseball, it's the third inning. It's relatively early in the life. We're now on the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform, and there are several iterations to follow. Engineering is being dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption and really the beginning of adoption in production, where what we really had been dealing with for the most part, in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle. So we're still early on, and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become the HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production, and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is, we've seen more memory adoption in the Gen5 than we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we had originally envisioned. \nBren Higgins: John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about at our Investor Day, there is an application for reticle qualification in the fabs for EUV reticles. So we're -- as we start to progress that use case, it's how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticles as they're being used in the wafer fab. So an incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen5 as it gets adopted. \nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And Bren, maybe just for my follow-up, I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analyst Day around op margin, sort of, bridge between now and 2023. You're already, kind of, ahead of the revenue -- op margin targets you gave in that model, both in the September quarter and in the December guide, and it sounds like December OpEx is unusually high per your comments. And in general, that op margin target you gave only assumed incremental op margins at the low end of your historical guidance. I'd hate to obsolete the model less than a quarter out, but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside or conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day? \nBren Higgins: Yes, John, it's a good question. I mean, I think one of the challenges in putting together the model is it reflects a different mix of business that we have today but also expected moving forward. So clearly, in the September quarter and even in December what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business and that is behaving consistent with the historical model that we've had out there. So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we tried to reflect was based on our expectations for growth over time, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. \nOperator: The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, first question, on the foundry/logic side of things, can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that, if you could speak to also reuse? That clearly was a headwind, basically from 20-nanometer down, but it sounds like 7 non-EUV progressing to 5 EUV, but that's a seismic shift here that is driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of those things. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, CJ, I'll take the question, and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry/logic is -- it's not particularly broad. We expect it to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts -- design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there are so many different devices that are being introduced at these advanced nodes. So we don't suspect that there will be that much. The other thing is, we have new product cycle, which are really adding lot of capabilities. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible. But we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen it in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns and also some of the additional challenges, the advanced nodes are pushing, even without broad EUV. And once you broaden out EUV, you get even more of that. \nBren Higgins: Yes, I think the big difference between this node, and let's say, 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader end market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse as that capacity is deployed to support all that activity, and a high-mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product windows. So it's a good story, and we expect this node to have some legs. And certainly, the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and strong expectations for that. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. If I could sneak in a quick second question. You talked about a return to $370 million, $375 million OpEx in March. And I guess, curious, how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020? \nBren Higgins: Yes, CJ, I outlined it at Investor Day. There's a number of activities that are happening, and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer-term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher-cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint. So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line, we'll be operating in that range as we move through the year with the usual program development expenses that could cause you to move one direction or the other. I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range as we move towards the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, it's probably at the higher end. \nOperator: The next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Co. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I just had a quick one, Rick, you kind of spoke about how Gen5 is going to double in 2020. Is that primarily coming from foundry's 5 nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption, too? \nBren Higgins: So Krish, that was -- the comments were that we saw a doubling in '19 from '18. And although, to Rick's earlier point about Gen5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in, in terms of how it supports EUV reticle qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen5. But we haven't quantified how much more. I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity, both for 7-nanometer and for 5, but you'll see more adoption of Gen5 in production as N5. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. And just to add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer, in terms of the early evaluation and use so that sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19, where we got it out and established in all the leading jobs. \nBren Higgins: Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing, as I look at the order profile, it would imply we're going to have growth in the number of units as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. \nOperator: The next question is from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. On EUV litho adoption and your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think we could gather that your reticle inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year, up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML, let's say, over the next couple of years, it's still a runway for very strong growth, around 25%, 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mask inspection business looking into next year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I mean, I think, Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE year in reticle inspection and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer side as we see incremental capacity there. And then you'll start to see some activity as we move into next year. As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that we'll start shipping in 2020 also. So you'll see a mix and match. But as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV, we believe we've got the market pretty well served with the capabilities that we're offering. \nHarlan Sur: Yes, makes a lot of sense. And then on the Specialty Semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so again, if I look at the trends heading into next year, you've got a big step up in RF content, in 5G smartphones, in infrastructure, you've got more power products in auto and industrial, and of course, all this advanced packaging and things like system and package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year, but wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS? \nRichard Wallace: Right. Well, obviously, we're newer to that business. But as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers, it does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you've pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. '20 looks like a good year for SPTS. And our current modeling of it, based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G, it looks like a, hopefully, a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So we feel good about it, and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. \nOperator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year, you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share, but I think a lot of people are looking at foundry CapEx and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak, at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers, like, we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity point of view for nonmemory. So -- also people are looking at TSMC CapEx, and it's kind of $5 billion in Q4, and that's kind of a $20 billion run rate. So how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of a near-term peak in foundry logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipment rates continuing to grow in foundry/logic next year? \nRichard Wallace: Sure, Tim. Well, it is true that we had strength, as we mentioned, and you're -- half-on-half considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers. There are other customers that will broaden out in next year, and so we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing. So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half to this year. But we're counting on some broadening. And again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefit of that revenue next year. \n Bren, do you want to add any color to that? \nBren Higgins: No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year has been from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified end demand environment into next year, we feel comfortable given the comments we made in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability in foundry and logic as we move into 2020. \nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, I guess, I had a question on Orbotech. If you look at systems revenue, it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December, Bren, for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat-panel display and the PCB business? I guess, the real question is, why is the flat-panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows, and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much, much lower margins. So just -- can you just, kind of, talk through all that? \nBren Higgins: Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter and lead times there, that -- those deliveries happen in December. In that business, it's a build-to-order business, so usually when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well. So I would expect it to uptick. I think as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after 6 years of growth, we saw 2020 -- or 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020 either.\n So we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your points, and we're -- some of the actions we're taking that I referred to in terms of cost, structural cost, reduction actions are particular to that business. And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability at these trough levels and position that we can -- as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first. I hear your point, and we'll see how it plays out over time. \nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nVivek Arya: Congratulations on the strong growth. I had 2 questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious, what is the right way to think about process control and density in EUV versus non-EUV systems? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year. Do you think it's a bigger factor for you next year? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers. I mean, obviously, the value of EUV is a reduction in layers. And so we would see that, that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV, but you really get process control intensity in a couple of ways: one, you get it in a mask shop because you have to do more inspection to assure that you have a high-quality mask. And we're still, as an industry, trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, nonpellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask; the other thing is in print check to verify and validate that Bren mentioned in an earlier question, we see that as an opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall, it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA. \nVivek Arya: And my follow-up, how large was domestic China spend for you this year? And just conceptually, how are you thinking about it going into next year? \nBren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said in the remarks, I mean, at the beginning of the year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18. And it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up about flat. And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in, but it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the company. And I would expect that to stay relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. \nVivek Arya: So that is not part of the outperformance assumption for next year? \nBren Higgins: No. I think -- look, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly, it improved the performance in -- with a factor in performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year, no, I don't -- I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of how we're planning. I expect a flattish environment in native China. \nOperator: The next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. \nQuinn Bolton: Just wanted to follow up on the question from Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assume that that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then 1 Alpha processes, do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps as we see EUV coming into high-volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense, again, for the same reasons. You have the mask shop and you have on the wafer, and you have a reduction in layers counterbalancing it. I don't think it's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of, say, 10% process control intensity, you might get 0.5 point to 1 point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it will also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do -- have pellicles. It will change a little bit in how it plays out for us. \nQuinn Bolton: Okay, great. And then a follow-up question was just, it sounds like you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business, and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guys. But just wondering if you could comment based on, sort of, orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing -- starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to certain customers at this point? You wouldn't call it, kind of, the beginning of a broader-based recovery? \nBren Higgins: No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly, that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18, and so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which, ultimately, supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that impact. So I wouldn't say I see that as a leading indicator of new business. But certainly, given the market position of that product and how memory drives wafers, if you do see a pickup in memory, we will see that business impacted. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Congrats on the results. As it relates to your service business, I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen, particularly around the memory side in your installed base? And maybe, how do we think about that relative to your gross margin guide for the December quarter? \nBren Higgins: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing that drove an uptick in the revenue level for Service quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the Service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So look, you do have a gross margin impact to growth in Service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally. And the thing to keep in mind is it with our Service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe, is an accretive stream to the overall total. So it's not affecting, I think, quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter, it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the specialty semi side, now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand the -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei? Or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It -- I wouldn't say it's the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter. So we continue to see that. And we talked about, if I recall, $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular. There are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean OSATs. So there are number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business. Now in the long run, as those customers in that area -- or the end customer, the customers' customer starts to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us. So -- but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also, automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing, I think, a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in and would expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier, but it's a business that has a really good market position. I think the long-term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging, power, and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see, and we like the business model of that business. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. And more specifically, I think on Huawei, if you thought about the reactions of the suppliers to Huawei was there was uncertainty when the -- they had first came in and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain. So we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now I think people are dealing with it and that will actually cause the business to resume its growth. \nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. \nPatrick Ho: Rick, maybe first off, in the past, you've talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side of things, particularly as layers increased. As the industry starts shipping to 128 layers, do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side given the complexity of the layers and the increased number of layers for next-generation devices? \nRichard Wallace: I think the main opportunity -- it's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really in what's happening on the bare wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher, both the cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects and deep trenches, but it's probably more flatness-driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities. We talked about at the Analyst Day with the work we have on CD-SAXS, in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection, it's more about Surfscan. \nPatrick Ho: Great. As my follow-up question, in terms of the domestic China opportunity, obviously, we're seeing some of these capacity built begin and you're benefiting from new capacity build out. But given some of it is also trailing edge logic-type of capacity builds, is this simply because they are new capacity? Or are there opportunities within the, I guess, the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities, both for your inspection and metrology products? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I think that the -- there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale, in terms of what you think of it as the larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region -- reason. So that, kind of, creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that. Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto, as China is an important auto market, there are more Specialty Semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China. Not by much, I'd say, probably of our mix of semiconductor business, it's 55-45 to memory. I look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT. Rick talked about automotive. And so the yield earnings challenges in logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shifting are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade pass as they start to progress some of their technologies. So -- and they're serving, I think, real markets ultimately. And so I think that they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment and their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. \nOperator: Your final question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: Congrats on the very strong results. I just wanted to go back to the half-over-half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up, I guess, every quarter on a sequential basis, this year, a couple of quarters ago. So I guess the question is, based on customer projects, based on customer conversations, what are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business? Or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on a half-over-half basis? \nBren Higgins: Well, like I said, I think we're little early to guide second half -- or half-to-half trajectory, then obviously, I think a part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments, again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry. I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half, up 20-ish percent over the first half, it does, obviously, imply that WFE is higher in the first half -- or the second half versus the first half, so the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year at these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half. You have to have that kind of growth to, sort of, sustain at this level of business. But I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I guess what I would add to that is we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're not in a great position to predict WFE. Does that make sense? \nToshiya Hari: Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up. On China -- on native China WFE, I think, Bren, you talked about 2020, at least at this point, kind of, looking kind of flattish relative to 2019. When you think about the mix of spend on process control, could that move higher? Or what are your preliminary thoughts on that? \nBren Higgins: Yes -- no, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business that we expect, and we expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So I'm not expecting -- at least for our business, not expecting growth but not expecting decline in 2020 at this point. We'll see how it plays out. But that's the least where we stand today. \nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks. \nKevin Kessel: Yes. Thank you, Christian. And thank you, everyone, for your time today and interest in KLA. Christian, please conclude the call. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter. \n Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance, a result of strong customer pull for KLA's solutions and focused execution, despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments.\n As a global leader in process control and supplier of process-enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges is the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations in numerous key industries. \n Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses. The KLA operating model is essential to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.\n Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have 4 objectives that serve as our guide and drive our high-performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent Investor Day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These 4 objectives are: market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence, and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses, including acquired ones, with a focus on these key 4 objectives, and it shows in our overall results published today.\n Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment. \n KLA's strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum we see due to support, both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions. Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019 at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019, with KLA's Semi Process Control business, inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018. \n Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020, as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly, and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success.\n The accelerating adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen5 demand in the near term. Also, at last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new EBEAM inspection platform in several years. I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial tool performance. KLA's differentiated EBEAM inspection platform works with Gen5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes.\n Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA. In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better-than-expected demand in the September quarter helping to contribute to the revenue upside we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology road maps.\n And finally, KLA Service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi Process Control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our Service businesses, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration, and our Service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.\n Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds and the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions, sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day.\n 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our prospects for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think if I thought about Gen5 right now and you want to use baseball, it's the third inning. It's relatively early in the life. We're now on the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform, and there are several iterations to follow. Engineering is being dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption and really the beginning of adoption in production, where what we really had been dealing with for the most part, in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle. So we're still early on, and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become the HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production, and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is, we've seen more memory adoption in the Gen5 than we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we had originally envisioned. Yes, CJ, I'll take the question, and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry/logic is -- it's not particularly broad. We expect it to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts -- design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there are so many different devices that are being introduced at these advanced nodes. So we don't suspect that there will be that much. The other thing is, we have new product cycle, which are really adding lot of capabilities. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible. But we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen it in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns and also some of the additional challenges, the advanced nodes are pushing, even without broad EUV. And once you broaden out EUV, you get even more of that. Yes. And just to add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer, in terms of the early evaluation and use so that sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19, where we got it out and established in all the leading jobs. Right. Well, obviously, we're newer to that business. But as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers, it does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you've pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. '20 looks like a good year for SPTS. And our current modeling of it, based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G, it looks like a, hopefully, a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So we feel good about it, and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. Sure, Tim. Well, it is true that we had strength, as we mentioned, and you're -- half-on-half considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers. There are other customers that will broaden out in next year, and so we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing. So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half to this year. But we're counting on some broadening. And again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefit of that revenue next year. \n Bren, do you want to add any color to that? Yes. Process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers. I mean, obviously, the value of EUV is a reduction in layers. And so we would see that, that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV, but you really get process control intensity in a couple of ways: one, you get it in a mask shop because you have to do more inspection to assure that you have a high-quality mask. And we're still, as an industry, trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, nonpellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask; the other thing is in print check to verify and validate that Bren mentioned in an earlier question, we see that as an opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall, it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA. Yes. I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense, again, for the same reasons. You have the mask shop and you have on the wafer, and you have a reduction in layers counterbalancing it. I don't think it's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of, say, 10% process control intensity, you might get 0.5 point to 1 point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it will also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do -- have pellicles. It will change a little bit in how it plays out for us. Yes. And more specifically, I think on Huawei, if you thought about the reactions of the suppliers to Huawei was there was uncertainty when the -- they had first came in and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain. So we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now I think people are dealing with it and that will actually cause the business to resume its growth. I think the main opportunity -- it's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really in what's happening on the bare wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher, both the cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects and deep trenches, but it's probably more flatness-driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities. We talked about at the Analyst Day with the work we have on CD-SAXS, in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection, it's more about Surfscan. Yes. I think that the -- there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale, in terms of what you think of it as the larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region -- reason. So that, kind of, creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that. Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto, as China is an important auto market, there are more Specialty Semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. Yes. I guess what I would add to that is we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're not in a great position to predict WFE. Does that make sense?"

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA, with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also marked a new record for the company. Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was $1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61%, driven by incremental revenue growth and a stronger-than-expected semi process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of $1.75 to $2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively. Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter, as both cash from operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of $496 million and $464 million. We are proud of our financial results this quarter, and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward, with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.\n A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the tenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it over time as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $228 million of common stock and also paid $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon divesting of restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced, that the Board of Directors authorized, an additional $1 billion share repurchase program resulting in $1.6 billion available to repurchase under Board authorization at quarter end.\n Please turn to Slide 11 for a review of the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Review of the semi process -- revenue for the Semi Process Control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the back of strength in foundry and logic. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 has improved modestly, driven by investments in EUV and stronger foundry demand. In addition, increased demand from native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong at approximately 44% of semi process control revenue, up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter; logic was 13% of total semi process control revenue versus 12% last quarter.\n I'll turn now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and edge solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications, like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we're encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market. Despite these near-term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis to calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was $179 million, down 3% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. \n Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows: wafer inspection was 32%; patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our Semiconductor Process Control segment; Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%; PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 9%; other, which includes bench-top analytical instruments and the KLA Pro mature products and enhancements business, was 3%; Service was 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, the U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4%, with the rest of Asia at 3%. \n Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income and expense in the September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long-term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in tax reserves related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S. Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as the long-term planning rate. Net income was $398 million, and we had 160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.\n Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past 5 years, we have averaged just over 100% free cash flow conversion. And over the last 12 months, it's been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross margins, and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion.\n Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchased shares being slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussions.\n Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially, roughly 4% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundry is forecasted to be about 55% of semi process control system revenue in the December quarter, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi process control system revenue next quarter.\n For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half. Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in a range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we are modeling NIM to be approximately $385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarter is due principally to the timing of non-headcount-related product engineering expenses for next-generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower-cost locations.\n We would expect to see an impact from these activities through 2020, with the return on these investments beginning in 2021. As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of $370 million to $375 million, as product development expenses normalize to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares.\n In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments in what remains an environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance, and we are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. \n Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or half-to-half trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment, with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019 as customers continue to progress their technology road maps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversified end demand.\n For memory, we expect a better year in 2020, and disciplined supply management in 2019 has improved the overall condition in both segments. Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control in foundry and logic, improving process control intensity in memory and contributions from new products, calendar 2020 is setting up for another year of relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we report earnings for December quarter.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about at our Investor Day, there is an application for reticle qualification in the fabs for EUV reticles. So we're -- as we start to progress that use case, it's how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticles as they're being used in the wafer fab. So an incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen5 as it gets adopted. Yes, John, it's a good question. I mean, I think one of the challenges in putting together the model is it reflects a different mix of business that we have today but also expected moving forward. So clearly, in the September quarter and even in December what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business and that is behaving consistent with the historical model that we've had out there. So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we tried to reflect was based on our expectations for growth over time, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. Yes, I think the big difference between this node, and let's say, 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader end market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse as that capacity is deployed to support all that activity, and a high-mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product windows. So it's a good story, and we expect this node to have some legs. And certainly, the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and strong expectations for that. Yes, CJ, I outlined it at Investor Day. There's a number of activities that are happening, and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer-term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher-cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint. So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line, we'll be operating in that range as we move through the year with the usual program development expenses that could cause you to move one direction or the other. I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range as we move towards the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, it's probably at the higher end. So Krish, that was -- the comments were that we saw a doubling in '19 from '18. And although, to Rick's earlier point about Gen5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in, in terms of how it supports EUV reticle qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen5. But we haven't quantified how much more. I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity, both for 7-nanometer and for 5, but you'll see more adoption of Gen5 in production as N5. Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing, as I look at the order profile, it would imply we're going to have growth in the number of units as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. Yes. I mean, I think, Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE year in reticle inspection and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer side as we see incremental capacity there. And then you'll start to see some activity as we move into next year. As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that we'll start shipping in 2020 also. So you'll see a mix and match. But as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV, we believe we've got the market pretty well served with the capabilities that we're offering. No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year has been from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified end demand environment into next year, we feel comfortable given the comments we made in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability in foundry and logic as we move into 2020. Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter and lead times there, that -- those deliveries happen in December. In that business, it's a build-to-order business, so usually when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well. So I would expect it to uptick. I think as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after 6 years of growth, we saw 2020 -- or 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020 either.\n So we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your points, and we're -- some of the actions we're taking that I referred to in terms of cost, structural cost, reduction actions are particular to that business. And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability at these trough levels and position that we can -- as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first. I hear your point, and we'll see how it plays out over time. Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said in the remarks, I mean, at the beginning of the year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18. And it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up about flat. And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in, but it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the company. And I would expect that to stay relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. No. I think -- look, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly, it improved the performance in -- with a factor in performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year, no, I don't -- I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of how we're planning. I expect a flattish environment in native China. No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly, that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18, and so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which, ultimately, supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that impact. So I wouldn't say I see that as a leading indicator of new business. But certainly, given the market position of that product and how memory drives wafers, if you do see a pickup in memory, we will see that business impacted. Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing that drove an uptick in the revenue level for Service quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the Service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So look, you do have a gross margin impact to growth in Service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally. And the thing to keep in mind is it with our Service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe, is an accretive stream to the overall total. So it's not affecting, I think, quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter, it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. Yes. It -- I wouldn't say it's the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter. So we continue to see that. And we talked about, if I recall, $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular. There are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean OSATs. So there are number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business. Now in the long run, as those customers in that area -- or the end customer, the customers' customer starts to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us. So -- but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also, automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing, I think, a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in and would expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier, but it's a business that has a really good market position. I think the long-term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging, power, and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see, and we like the business model of that business. Yes. Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China. Not by much, I'd say, probably of our mix of semiconductor business, it's 55-45 to memory. I look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT. Rick talked about automotive. And so the yield earnings challenges in logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shifting are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade pass as they start to progress some of their technologies. So -- and they're serving, I think, real markets ultimately. And so I think that they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment and their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. Well, like I said, I think we're little early to guide second half -- or half-to-half trajectory, then obviously, I think a part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments, again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry. I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half, up 20-ish percent over the first half, it does, obviously, imply that WFE is higher in the first half -- or the second half versus the first half, so the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year at these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half. You have to have that kind of growth to, sort of, sustain at this level of business. But I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point. Yes -- no, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business that we expect, and we expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So I'm not expecting -- at least for our business, not expecting growth but not expecting decline in 2020 at this point. We'll see how it plays out. But that's the least where we stand today."

Our IR website also contains future investor events, as well as presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRick Wallace: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom-line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading-edge R&D efforts. Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision, and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams, continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace. I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022. As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge development, fab optimization, and regional expansion, KLA offers a leading portfolio of products to solve our customer's challenges. We continue to invest in high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we are prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities and leveraging these technologies in our product and service offerings help drive adoption, differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics, and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings to deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improve time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers. Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing, KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4 times the nearest competitor, as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position when -- within the electronics ecosystem through our Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out the KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy. With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced four new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpartnered wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solution is aimed to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers. Second, KLA's strong market leadership in optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, for product segments over $1 billion of revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2 times this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020. Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation EBM-based 8xx [ph] mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales, 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates, and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semiconductor process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8 times faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announce that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren.\nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn help sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40%. Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon. Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed its initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million, cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million. The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter-end. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared to June of last year. The approximate semiconductor process control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty semiconductor process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty semiconductor process's performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection. KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from Baa1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance. We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing the balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns that at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment. Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion, and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million of free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms, in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half, as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support the strong customer demand. Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in semiconductor process control equipment systems in the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high-30s to low-40s year-over-year percentage growth for the semiconductor process control systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market. Our September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 59%, and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million, other income and expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 the $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares. In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customer's multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future. KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence, and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong financial performance, and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders. And with, that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Britney, can you please queue up for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. EUV adoption continues strong. And if I look at the outlook for EUV Litho systems expected to grow like mid-30% this year. Do you have a positive exposure here via your wafer inspection systems, but also the strong leadership in EUV mask inspection and printed. I know this doesn't represent your entire process control business, but it's sort of a good proxy. But you guys are guiding your optical inspection, your mask inspection, and your overall process control business to go well above that range. So, what are the two or three dynamics that are driving the strength above EUV adoption? And more importantly, with the visibility that you guys have, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the overall second-half momentum into the first half of next calendar year?\nRick Wallace: Hey Harlan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio driven. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is, it's a pretty good mix between Gen 4 and Gen 5. So, both of the -- Gen 5 is more exposed, I would say to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of Gen 4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of memory, logic, foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory; that's one area. We mentioned also reticles having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So, we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. That's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. Bren, you want to provide more color?\nBren Higgins: Yes. So, as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So, there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms and also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. Also 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changed all that much in the double patterning environment. As we move to EUV, reticle complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So, I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22.\nHarlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then on the gross margin front, if you could just help us understand the upticking in our gross margins into the September quarter. It looks like component costs are rising, I'm assuming the team also has to pay expedite fees for some parts and your end market mix is more weighted towards memory, which I would think would have some slight negative bias on gross margins. So, it's great to see the team driving the margin profile higher, but just help us understand some of the drivers of that?\nRick Wallace: Customer mix doesn't impact our margin profile, our products across all segments have the same margin profile. So, it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the quarter-to-quarter, 50 basis point increase we have. Most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi-process control systems and those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or EPC business. So, that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher, those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters. On the component side, there is pressure on components, there is pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically, for the frames of our tools. So, we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world, we have factories in different locations but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So, far it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So, we worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable. But I do expect we'll see some pressure on components. The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model, not a cost-based model. But we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. With these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward.\nHarlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Thanks, Rick, Bren. Congratulation on the strong quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I wanted to go back to your prepared comments about the investments that you're making in AI and ML. I mean clearly, some of your peers have talked about big investments in that area. I'd be curious if you can help us understand how you think you might differ from theirs? How -- maybe your incompetency [ph] gives you an upper hand here. And as you think about this, is this a way to maintain already outstanding share? Or do you think there is actually incremental revenue and SAM capability as you bring this out? And Bren, maybe on the gross margin; what could be the influence to gross margin? I'm assuming this is mainly software IP, which -- would it seem to be gross margin accretive?\nRick Wallace: John, thanks for the question. We've been working on what has been -- what is now called AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data in our systems, especially in optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for a signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is, just extracting more information out of that data. So, as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another but we continue to add upgrades. So, I think to answer your question, one way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms in the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to shift [ph] wavelengths for example to get more capability, we can do that with algorithm. So, one of the questions that had been brought up in the past was, for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why EBM was going to maybe take a large prior of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability, that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems. So, I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products, part of why Gen 4 has a longer life now is, we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it. To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products, those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology but also some of our traditionally lower-end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability [ph]. So, it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume, because you're -- we do make a large investment. We're by far -- we have the most investment going on, no question among our peers because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So, Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L.\nBren Higgins: Yes, John. And I think it's much more of an operating margin statement or a reduction in R&D intensity is another way to about it. Platform extendability is one of the biggest decisions we make in our product lifecycle processes. We're making choices and we can extend platforms. It means that over time we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So, by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins. Now, in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company not just within semi-process control, where we have businesses. Now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels, but we're selling software directly and we have that there, and we also have it in the EPC business where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings. So, there is a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology roadmaps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you very much.\nRick Wallace: Thanks, John.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nCJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. As you think about your implied revenue guide for December, it looks like it's about $250 million of process control. And it sounds like that is coming on, based on new manufacturing capabilities that you're bringing online. So curious, what's the impact to gross margins at that time frame? And will that satisfy all pent-up demand? Or will your lead times still be extended heading into calendar '22?\nRick Wallace: Yes, CJ. It's a great question. As far as lead times go, I think lead times are holding pretty flat. One of the challenges and we had hoped that we'd start to see those pull in a bit, but demand has continued to increase. So we're seeing stronger demand and we're doing a lot of work to add capacity, so things are extending out, but they're not necessarily pulling in either. Yes, based on our comments, you do have a ramp in our -- in semi-process control equipment into the December quarter, that's a richer mix. So, I'm not going to guide December but that should carry a richer gross margin profile, given the nature of the products that we're shipping. That capacity has come online, that's a revenue recognition dynamics related to new facilities and product transitions that's pushing some of those shipments if you will that are happening this quarter that will happen next quarter. So, that's also part of the higher sequential growth that we're seeing into the December quarter. Did I answer your questions?\nCJ Muse: Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak a second one in. As you think about your foundry logic outlook for 2022 and you talked about continued strength, I was hoping you could speak to perhaps any changes that you see in the landscape whether leading-edge, lagging-edge, EUV adoption, DRAM anything we should be thinking about portfolio wise that could be a little different than 2021?\nRick Wallace: Yes. Really, I think just in terms of overall sustainability, we would expect to see the leading edge continue to invest as we go into next year. And given the public statements that have been made there, I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the trailing edge side, we are seeing orders that are coming into backlog, but also in the funnel from a number of customers and much more meaningful levels of customers that haven't invested all that much in the past and are addressing some of these automotive and industrial, and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So, I would think from a shipment and revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into 2022. China has been mostly logic-centric this year, native China. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth. Certainly, there is -- I think sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year but I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the one area we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So, I think those are the dynamics and how they're planned. I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21.\nBren Higgins: But CJ, I mean, just one thing to add, a lot of the business that we're booking now is revenue in '22. I mean that's part of our confidence in '22. We're filled out for '21. And so, that's part of what we're seeing. And then some of the players you know who are trying to regain the lead, a lot of that investment hasn't really shown up in our revenue numbers yet.\nCJ Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. I had two of them. First one for Rick or Bren. I do want to have the December quarter question a different way, you said your semi-process control should grow 40% this year, and a half or half is mid-teens growth. So, if I look at that, it looks like December quarter is around $2.3 billion, give or take. Is that a decent proxy for December revenues? And are you not seeing any impact from any of the component shortages that's affecting some of your friends in the industry? And then I had a follow-up.\nRick Wallace: Yes. So I'm not going to guide December specifically. What we're trying to do is give you some perspective on our expectations for growth of semiconductor process control equipment for the year, that was the high '30s to low 40 statement. We also talked about the total company growing mid-teens half to half, and so that was another statement there as well. So, I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided. Components are a daily challenge, we are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long term, and so, we have to make decisions and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into '22. So, it's a challenge, we're working our way through it. I'm spending more time -- I've been with KLA for 21 years and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have. And certainly, as a CFO since 2013; so, we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it, and the guidance and context we provided contemplates what we expect to happen. It's our best expectations based on what we know today.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Bren. And then, just as a follow-up, I do got a question on China. Obviously, you had really strong sales there in the June quarter. And if I try to back out, your ex-China sales had actually declined from March to June. And you also said China is mostly logic, so I'm kind of curious, are there that many logic foundry players in China? Or is this just a long tail of smaller players buying equipment? And any kind of color you can give on China with regards to your sales and any kind of split between domestic and MNCs would be very helpful. Thank you.\nRick Wallace: Yes. You have to remember that when we just talk about our mix of business that's the total company, so that includes EPC. So, I believe, our China percentage was like 32%. If you looked at the native investment as a percent of our semiconductor process control segment, it's about 25%. So, the numbers, when you're extrapolating like that can lead you to different conclusions. There are a number of small projects that are logic-centric projects in China that are targeting specific markets around IoT and image sensors, and a bunch of those kinds of opportunity is obviously, automotive and industrial. So, I think there are new projects in a lot of cases which are going to be coming online over time. But there is a lot of activity there. So, yes, there are.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about -- you mentioned having new products for the automotive sector. And how are you thinking about this, you sort of see the older foundry nodes, looks like it's going to be a source of sustainable strength for a while. Can you actually target that business a little bit more directly than you have? And just generally, what kind of activity are you seeing in the older foundry nodes?\nRick Wallace: Yes. Sure, Joseph. We've actually been engaged for quite a while with some of the leading automotive -- even the automotive customers coming to us asking us to help them with their suppliers. That's been going on for a few years. What's really happened now is, it's broadened, the number of customers that are recognizing and of course the shortage of automotive semiconductors contributed to that. So, we've been developing products that have, I would say, are adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, whereas you know, they're looking for more reliability, there is some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs. So, yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start to 2020 where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on. And so, we do have those products, we're engaging with customers, and there is a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So, we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that and it's also where our business that we got through, Orbotech, SPTS works also some of the process capability there. So, it's more than just inspection, it's broader for us than that. So, it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area and I think it's one that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters.\nJoseph Moore: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Curious on your advanced packaging. You recently talked about packaging becoming more like front-end. I was curious you know, how would you compare maybe contrast the two in terms of just the increasing capital intensity. And then maybe can you touch on your position in front-end and how that maybe drive differentiation for the packaging?\nRick Wallace: Joe, I think there's a couple of things. One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there is more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their best behind a proven player. So, we have the capability. We have some products. We're doing some product developments, some product adaptations in support of that, but the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is of course in the leading edge, but the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth of process control. So, I would say, we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so, we're engaging with our customers in that. And I can tell you, we're getting as much pool there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their roadmap. So, we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity and it's not just process control, once again some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement. So, we do see strong growth. We see a lot of potential consistent with the plans we laid out in 2019 at our Investor Day.\nBren Higgins: You also have the integration of the PCB board to IC substrate into the package and so that's a good driver for us moving forward. We're working on new capability to better address that market. We also -- the ICOS' finished component inspection business is inspecting the packages, so that complexity is also driving an inflection in that market. We're seeing very strong growth in that market as well. Probably the fastest-growing part of EPC is today is through ICOS. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities as Rick said and some of it's dependent on us bringing new capability to market. But certainly, customers are trying to leverage the different positions we have across a number of different applications, trying to leverage the relationship with us to do more there.\nRick Wallace: Yes. And just to put a number on it, we said $400 million in 2019. We're ahead of plan and we can beat that, do more than that with some of the developments we're contemplating. So, I think we've got the products now to perform to that and we can do more. And we're getting encouraged by the signs that we're seeing and engaging with these customers.\nJoe Quatrochi: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. Rick, maybe first off, big picture, kind of the long-term outlook for the process control industry and your positioning gate-all-around [ph] is becoming or it will be coming on board in the next few years. And I know you probably are working with your customers. You've got an incremental benefit when the industry transitions to FinFET transistors. How do you see the incremental opportunities as you go to gate-all-around where not only are you seeing new materials but more materials in that transistor area.\nRick Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. And as you know, with all our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So, I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters, because in the case of gate-all-around, adaptation to the Gen 4 wafer inspection in some ways is more important than what Gen 5 does. Gen 5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates but Gen 4 for the contrast. And so, some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. So, I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of half a percentage point if we're going from 15 to 15.5 depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between logic and memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections, provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So, we feel like we're really good position to support our customers to do that.\nPatrick Ho: Great, that's helpful. And my follow-up question may be for you, Bren, in terms of the investments you're making. We talked about systems, picking up expanding capacity, bringing people on board to meet the increased shipments. Services are also growing quite rapidly and you've mentioned that, it's growing faster than the target CAGR you are looking at. What are the types of investments you need to make in services given that not only is your semi services growing as the installed base grows, but PCB tends to be a very service-intensive business as well. And that marketplace is also showing signs of some more secular growth trend given some of the marketplaces that they penetrated. How do you look at service investments, both near term and over the next few years?\nBren Higgins: That's a great question. And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service business is of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been one of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint. So, being able to leverage our infrastructure now the go-to-market is different, how we engage with those customers is different. So, leveraging the infrastructure we have is I think a big part of that so there is a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if we see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so, whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities, so we can do a lot more diagnostic, these diagnosis tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation. So, I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing and it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using them from a utilization point of view.\nRick Wallace: Yes. And then, the biggest investment really right now is in the workforce to support that. And so, as Bren mentioned, we're working on that. I think that hiring, training, on-boarding as we anticipate the continued growth is an area we've done well with. But as you know, there is a big demand for talent out there. So, we have to keep on it, keep hiring and doing that training. So, that's probably the biggest area of investment, over time that's going to be the workforce.\nPatrick Ho: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I had two clarifications, Bren. And then I had a real question. The first two clarifications are, the comment you made about 15% half-on-half, that was a corporate revenue comment. Somebody attach that to a process control systems, but I don't think -- I think your process control systems comment was up like mid-30, high-30s to 40% for the year. That half-on-half comment was a corporate revenue comment. Correct?\nBren Higgins: That's correct, yes. And I attempted to clarify that in one of the earlier questions. But yes, you're right. That's the total company aggregate revenue expectation second half versus first half, mid-teens.\nTimothy Arcuri: Perfect. And then the second clarification, did you say that domestic China is 25% of your process control systems revenue. Because WFE, it's like 15% of total WFE.\nBren Higgins: In the quarter that we just completed.\nTimothy Arcuri: Yes. Okay, got it. Okay. So for my real question, I guess. So I wanted to ask about actinic. And it's always really been Tier to high NA for EUV. Otherwise, you use the 8xx and now you have the big microprocessor maker that's now pushing more aggressively on high NA. So, are you going to accelerate your development timeline for actinic?\nRick Wallace: Yes. Tim, it's a great question. We feel confident that we will have the capability we need when it is needed for the high NA. So, I understand what your question is, we believe that with the products that we have, with the 8xx in particular, and actually the continued capability we're seeing in 6xx, we feel that we will be there when the market is needed for the high NA.\nBren Higgins: Hey, Tim, just to also clarify on the China statement. So, that's of the semiconductor process control segment, which includes the service. It was 25% of the revenue in the June quarter.\nTimothy Arcuri: I see, including service. Okay, Bren. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if let's say hypothetically, WFE is 90 billion or 100 billion next year, are you prepared to support that right from your capacity perspective? Or I guess a different way of asking the question is, how much additional capacity are you planning to bring online next year?\nRick Wallace: Yes Vivek, that's an interesting question. And right now, what we're trying to do is ramp up to support the customer demand that we have. And I have expectations for incremental capacity as we move forward now. I feel like these are good investments to make for us over the long run given our expectations for multi-year growth in WFE. I think given the strength of the WFE investments in some of the end market drivers that we're talking about, that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that. So, these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward sort of a through cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. So, I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year, in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and in our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that.\nBren Higgins: I think the one thing I would add is, we are cognizant of our customers' desire to get more capability sooner and we're doing everything we can to size it. But the numbers you've talked about, we have contemplated in our plans.\nVivek Arya: Maybe a quick follow-up if I can. At what point do you sense that because of all the headlines around the capacity crunch, you have players who are now trying to become foundries on their own. That there is a pull-forward of demand that at what -- what's on your dashboard to tell you that whatever you're shipping right that the utilization levels are quite high and it's not just customers scrambling to add more capacity. Like, do you track what the usage is of the equipment that you ship?\nRick Wallace: Yes. Of course, we track the usage. I mean that's a metric that we're looking at all the time. But I would back up a little bit and say that the industry actually has a self-governing mechanism in it, which is the ability of all the equipment companies to ramp to the demand. And right now, when you talk to customers, they would take more shipments I think from everyone if they could get them sooner. So, there is a natural governance. And I'm sure you've heard, ASML talk about EUV through '22. So, it's naturally governed by that. So, I don't -- I think we're in a good place for a sustained run at this point.\nKevin Kessel: Thanks for that. Britney, we have time, it looks like for one last question.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, speaking of this multiyear investment plans that you just talked about, there -- obviously, there is a lot of new fabs being announced in the past few months. When do you expect those new fab investment to start generating revenue for you? And when do you expect to start seeing those orders coming in?\nRick Wallace: Well, in a lot of cases, we're already seeing the orders, right? So, I think that customers are getting into the queue for deliveries. And in some products, deliveries could be 12 months from now. So, it's absolutely happening and customers are trying to make those commitments as they're planning for their facilities. Obviously, they plan across a lot of different types of equipment. And so, those planning cycles tend to move around a little bit. Sometimes they are also dependent on winning business and product ramps and so on. So, there's always a little bit of variability around the timing. And then of course, generally as you try to build something, there's always infrastructure and delays and pull-ins that can happen associated with just construction overall. But yes, we're absolutely seeing that demand in the backlog and certainly in the sales funnel.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. Maybe my follow-up; it's a lot of questions on the semi process control side but, on the EPC business, is 15% growth for this year still a realistic assumption given the strength in auto and 5G? And maybe you can talk about with or without the display side of things. Thanks.\nRick Wallace: Yes. Including display, we're in the high teens for that business. So, we're seeing strength there. Display is about as we expected and we're seeing strength, I mentioned earlier about component inspection. Especially, semiconductor is also seeing strength. PCB is ahead of plan a little bit so I think that's moving along. Obviously, it's very tied to mobility and 5G. So, yes, we're seeing that pick up in terms of expectations for growth out of that product group.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the program back over to Kevin Kesseler -- Kessel, I apologize for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you very much. And wanted to thank everybody for their time, their interest, and their questions. We will be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's KLA Corporation June quarter 2021 post earnings call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom-line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading-edge R&D efforts. Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision, and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams, continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace. I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022. As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge development, fab optimization, and regional expansion, KLA offers a leading portfolio of products to solve our customer's challenges. We continue to invest in high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we are prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities and leveraging these technologies in our product and service offerings help drive adoption, differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics, and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings to deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improve time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers. Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing, KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4 times the nearest competitor, as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position when -- within the electronics ecosystem through our Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out the KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy. With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced four new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpartnered wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solution is aimed to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers. Second, KLA's strong market leadership in optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, for product segments over $1 billion of revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2 times this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020. Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation EBM-based 8xx [ph] mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales, 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates, and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semiconductor process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8 times faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announce that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Hey Harlan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio driven. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is, it's a pretty good mix between Gen 4 and Gen 5. So, both of the -- Gen 5 is more exposed, I would say to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of Gen 4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of memory, logic, foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory; that's one area. We mentioned also reticles having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So, we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. That's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. Bren, you want to provide more color? Customer mix doesn't impact our margin profile, our products across all segments have the same margin profile. So, it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the quarter-to-quarter, 50 basis point increase we have. Most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi-process control systems and those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or EPC business. So, that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher, those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters. On the component side, there is pressure on components, there is pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically, for the frames of our tools. So, we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world, we have factories in different locations but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So, far it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So, we worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable. But I do expect we'll see some pressure on components. The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model, not a cost-based model. But we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. With these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward. John, thanks for the question. We've been working on what has been -- what is now called AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data in our systems, especially in optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for a signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is, just extracting more information out of that data. So, as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another but we continue to add upgrades. So, I think to answer your question, one way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms in the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to shift [ph] wavelengths for example to get more capability, we can do that with algorithm. So, one of the questions that had been brought up in the past was, for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why EBM was going to maybe take a large prior of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability, that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems. So, I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products, part of why Gen 4 has a longer life now is, we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it. To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products, those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology but also some of our traditionally lower-end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability [ph]. So, it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume, because you're -- we do make a large investment. We're by far -- we have the most investment going on, no question among our peers because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So, Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L. Thanks, John. Yes, CJ. It's a great question. As far as lead times go, I think lead times are holding pretty flat. One of the challenges and we had hoped that we'd start to see those pull in a bit, but demand has continued to increase. So we're seeing stronger demand and we're doing a lot of work to add capacity, so things are extending out, but they're not necessarily pulling in either. Yes, based on our comments, you do have a ramp in our -- in semi-process control equipment into the December quarter, that's a richer mix. So, I'm not going to guide December but that should carry a richer gross margin profile, given the nature of the products that we're shipping. That capacity has come online, that's a revenue recognition dynamics related to new facilities and product transitions that's pushing some of those shipments if you will that are happening this quarter that will happen next quarter. So, that's also part of the higher sequential growth that we're seeing into the December quarter. Did I answer your questions? Yes. Really, I think just in terms of overall sustainability, we would expect to see the leading edge continue to invest as we go into next year. And given the public statements that have been made there, I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the trailing edge side, we are seeing orders that are coming into backlog, but also in the funnel from a number of customers and much more meaningful levels of customers that haven't invested all that much in the past and are addressing some of these automotive and industrial, and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So, I would think from a shipment and revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into 2022. China has been mostly logic-centric this year, native China. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth. Certainly, there is -- I think sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year but I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the one area we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So, I think those are the dynamics and how they're planned. I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21. Yes. So I'm not going to guide December specifically. What we're trying to do is give you some perspective on our expectations for growth of semiconductor process control equipment for the year, that was the high '30s to low 40 statement. We also talked about the total company growing mid-teens half to half, and so that was another statement there as well. So, I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided. Components are a daily challenge, we are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long term, and so, we have to make decisions and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into '22. So, it's a challenge, we're working our way through it. I'm spending more time -- I've been with KLA for 21 years and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have. And certainly, as a CFO since 2013; so, we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it, and the guidance and context we provided contemplates what we expect to happen. It's our best expectations based on what we know today. Yes. You have to remember that when we just talk about our mix of business that's the total company, so that includes EPC. So, I believe, our China percentage was like 32%. If you looked at the native investment as a percent of our semiconductor process control segment, it's about 25%. So, the numbers, when you're extrapolating like that can lead you to different conclusions. There are a number of small projects that are logic-centric projects in China that are targeting specific markets around IoT and image sensors, and a bunch of those kinds of opportunity is obviously, automotive and industrial. So, I think there are new projects in a lot of cases which are going to be coming online over time. But there is a lot of activity there. So, yes, there are. Yes. Sure, Joseph. We've actually been engaged for quite a while with some of the leading automotive -- even the automotive customers coming to us asking us to help them with their suppliers. That's been going on for a few years. What's really happened now is, it's broadened, the number of customers that are recognizing and of course the shortage of automotive semiconductors contributed to that. So, we've been developing products that have, I would say, are adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, whereas you know, they're looking for more reliability, there is some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs. So, yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start to 2020 where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on. And so, we do have those products, we're engaging with customers, and there is a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So, we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that and it's also where our business that we got through, Orbotech, SPTS works also some of the process capability there. So, it's more than just inspection, it's broader for us than that. So, it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area and I think it's one that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters. Joe, I think there's a couple of things. One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there is more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their best behind a proven player. So, we have the capability. We have some products. We're doing some product developments, some product adaptations in support of that, but the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is of course in the leading edge, but the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth of process control. So, I would say, we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so, we're engaging with our customers in that. And I can tell you, we're getting as much pool there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their roadmap. So, we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity and it's not just process control, once again some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement. So, we do see strong growth. We see a lot of potential consistent with the plans we laid out in 2019 at our Investor Day. Yes. And just to put a number on it, we said $400 million in 2019. We're ahead of plan and we can beat that, do more than that with some of the developments we're contemplating. So, I think we've got the products now to perform to that and we can do more. And we're getting encouraged by the signs that we're seeing and engaging with these customers. Yes, it's a great question. And as you know, with all our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So, I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters, because in the case of gate-all-around, adaptation to the Gen 4 wafer inspection in some ways is more important than what Gen 5 does. Gen 5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates but Gen 4 for the contrast. And so, some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. So, I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of half a percentage point if we're going from 15 to 15.5 depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between logic and memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections, provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So, we feel like we're really good position to support our customers to do that. Yes. And then, the biggest investment really right now is in the workforce to support that. And so, as Bren mentioned, we're working on that. I think that hiring, training, on-boarding as we anticipate the continued growth is an area we've done well with. But as you know, there is a big demand for talent out there. So, we have to keep on it, keep hiring and doing that training. So, that's probably the biggest area of investment, over time that's going to be the workforce. Yes. Tim, it's a great question. We feel confident that we will have the capability we need when it is needed for the high NA. So, I understand what your question is, we believe that with the products that we have, with the 8xx in particular, and actually the continued capability we're seeing in 6xx, we feel that we will be there when the market is needed for the high NA. Yes Vivek, that's an interesting question. And right now, what we're trying to do is ramp up to support the customer demand that we have. And I have expectations for incremental capacity as we move forward now. I feel like these are good investments to make for us over the long run given our expectations for multi-year growth in WFE. I think given the strength of the WFE investments in some of the end market drivers that we're talking about, that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that. So, these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward sort of a through cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. So, I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year, in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and in our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that. Yes. Of course, we track the usage. I mean that's a metric that we're looking at all the time. But I would back up a little bit and say that the industry actually has a self-governing mechanism in it, which is the ability of all the equipment companies to ramp to the demand. And right now, when you talk to customers, they would take more shipments I think from everyone if they could get them sooner. So, there is a natural governance. And I'm sure you've heard, ASML talk about EUV through '22. So, it's naturally governed by that. So, I don't -- I think we're in a good place for a sustained run at this point. Well, in a lot of cases, we're already seeing the orders, right? So, I think that customers are getting into the queue for deliveries. And in some products, deliveries could be 12 months from now. So, it's absolutely happening and customers are trying to make those commitments as they're planning for their facilities. Obviously, they plan across a lot of different types of equipment. And so, those planning cycles tend to move around a little bit. Sometimes they are also dependent on winning business and product ramps and so on. So, there's always a little bit of variability around the timing. And then of course, generally as you try to build something, there's always infrastructure and delays and pull-ins that can happen associated with just construction overall. But yes, we're absolutely seeing that demand in the backlog and certainly in the sales funnel. Yes. Including display, we're in the high teens for that business. So, we're seeing strength there. Display is about as we expected and we're seeing strength, I mentioned earlier about component inspection. Especially, semiconductor is also seeing strength. PCB is ahead of plan a little bit so I think that's moving along. Obviously, it's very tied to mobility and 5G. So, yes, we're seeing that pick up in terms of expectations for growth out of that product group."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn help sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40%. Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon. Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed its initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million, cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million. The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter-end. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared to June of last year. The approximate semiconductor process control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty semiconductor process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty semiconductor process's performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection. KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from Baa1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance. We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing the balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns that at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment. Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion, and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million of free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms, in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half, as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support the strong customer demand. Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in semiconductor process control equipment systems in the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high-30s to low-40s year-over-year percentage growth for the semiconductor process control systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market. Our September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 59%, and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million, other income and expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 the $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares. In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customer's multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future. KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence, and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong financial performance, and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders. And with, that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Yes. So, as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So, there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms and also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. Also 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changed all that much in the double patterning environment. As we move to EUV, reticle complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So, I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22. Yes, John. And I think it's much more of an operating margin statement or a reduction in R&D intensity is another way to about it. Platform extendability is one of the biggest decisions we make in our product lifecycle processes. We're making choices and we can extend platforms. It means that over time we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So, by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins. Now, in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company not just within semi-process control, where we have businesses. Now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels, but we're selling software directly and we have that there, and we also have it in the EPC business where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings. So, there is a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology roadmaps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time. But CJ, I mean, just one thing to add, a lot of the business that we're booking now is revenue in '22. I mean that's part of our confidence in '22. We're filled out for '21. And so, that's part of what we're seeing. And then some of the players you know who are trying to regain the lead, a lot of that investment hasn't really shown up in our revenue numbers yet. You also have the integration of the PCB board to IC substrate into the package and so that's a good driver for us moving forward. We're working on new capability to better address that market. We also -- the ICOS' finished component inspection business is inspecting the packages, so that complexity is also driving an inflection in that market. We're seeing very strong growth in that market as well. Probably the fastest-growing part of EPC is today is through ICOS. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities as Rick said and some of it's dependent on us bringing new capability to market. But certainly, customers are trying to leverage the different positions we have across a number of different applications, trying to leverage the relationship with us to do more there. That's a great question. And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service business is of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been one of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint. So, being able to leverage our infrastructure now the go-to-market is different, how we engage with those customers is different. So, leveraging the infrastructure we have is I think a big part of that so there is a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if we see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so, whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities, so we can do a lot more diagnostic, these diagnosis tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation. So, I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing and it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using them from a utilization point of view. That's correct, yes. And I attempted to clarify that in one of the earlier questions. But yes, you're right. That's the total company aggregate revenue expectation second half versus first half, mid-teens. In the quarter that we just completed. Hey, Tim, just to also clarify on the China statement. So, that's of the semiconductor process control segment, which includes the service. It was 25% of the revenue in the June quarter. I think the one thing I would add is, we are cognizant of our customers' desire to get more capability sooner and we're doing everything we can to size it. But the numbers you've talked about, we have contemplated in our plans."

Rick?\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining KLA\u2019s earning calls today. KLA\u2019s March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst the dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers, and shareholders. We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customer's needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA\u2019s record results in momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership, two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce, and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model. Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading-edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. In this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we are experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business. KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations. KLA\u2019s market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies, and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control. Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCP product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailored to the automotive industry. This quarter expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward. Calendar year 2021 is position to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customer's plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, but the demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA\u2019s essential role in supporting our customers drive to innovate and continuing to invest in future technology notes. Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA\u2019s share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA\u2019s market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show, KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum and gains EBM inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic, the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors, driving equipment spending. KLA\u2019s market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading-edge. Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our electronics packaging and components or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor \u2013 the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors, and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA strengthened our engagement with the top five semiconductor market leaders in packaging. And we're expanding our reach with those sets. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid a $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July KLA\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the 11 consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA\u2019s track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA\u2019s March, 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA\u2019s products and services and enabling the digital transformation with our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding and customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren.\nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range is stronger revenue in favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million to the June quarter. We were budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter or the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years. We expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%, and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 28% year-over-year with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection. Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agents. In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January, where we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low-to-mid 20s with a bias to the upside at calendar 2021 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments. Also in earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year 2021. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021, relative to the overall WFE market. Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenues expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.8. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. In closing the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets in a multiple technology nodes. We\u2019re encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment. KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we're on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustain technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, we're ready to queue for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulate on a really strong results. Rick or Bren, the first question I had was you're guiding to WFE obviously update since three months ago, similarly the mid-20 range. I'm kind of curious, if I look at some of your peers, they're talking about 30% range, but either way from your vantage point, how do you think KLA has any process controlled revenues are going to do relative to your mid-20\u2019s WFE growth on a calendar of 2021 basis, and then I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: Yes, Krish. Thanks for the comments. Hey, I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why I put the baseline in there. So I said that against the baseline of 2020 of $61 billion, we saw a \u2013 we see growth from there in the low-to-mid 20s percentile as \u2013 with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that, that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE, and certainly the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments. So we feel pretty good, not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us, we have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Super helpful, Bren. And then as a follow-up, and thanks for the color on the market share data from last year. I'm just looking more \u2013 looking ahead, can you talk a little bit for the market share dynamics, obviously a large U.S. company has spoken about gaining traction in process control, introduced a new optical inspection tool with the EB combo along with AI. So I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that impact, especially in foundry and logic? Or how do you kind of counteract that especially given that you are obviously the leader in this space today?\nRick Wallace: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said, and we view process control in 2021 is outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 \u2013 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the gardener data, as we highlighted over time, KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but \u2013 and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we\u2019re also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so, so we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall at a corporate level you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just first on the gross margin in the March quarter, what drove the upside and I guess importantly, as you look at June and full calendar year guide, what are the assumptions that you're making for kind of mix? And to what extent are you above target because of cyclical, because of mix, or should we just start thinking about 62 plus is being kind of a new target?\nBren Higgins: Yes, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business. And as Rick just mentioned and that's a richer business for us overall. So that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It\u2019s still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC, and so that's diluted from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities \u2013 the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year, certainly the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about on prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more biased to the upper end of that range. So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth and optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Rick as my follow-up going back to kind of the market share question, which I think is one of the key investor concerns out there. I think the concern that some investors have is that as we hit this inflection from optical to more exotic like \u2013 sources like e-beam an x-ray, there is sort of a view that the incumbency advantage kind of goes away. And perhaps we're all kind of estimating that inflection to happen more quickly than it will. But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world? How does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies?\nRick Wallace: Yes, thanks, John. I think the \u2013 I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. There is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi beam \u2013 e-beam solution are KLA, we're the ones that have it, that we're developing and introducing in the radical space which is I think \u2013 where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change, the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that Bren and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which has it slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition, it hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make at e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam \u2013 pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea, that's been around quite a while, and at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening.\nBren Higgins: John, I\u2019d just add \u2013 I'm sorry, just one other thing \u2013 I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right, so we talked about the accelerated growth relative to the market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right, that's the market, that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So to give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here, that's validating, I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways.\nJohn Pitzer: And Rick, does the incumbency advantage you enjoy at optical transferable as the world starts to move to e-beam?\nRick Wallace: Yes. John, I \u2013 again, I don't think the world is going to move large scale to e-beam. I mean, we're well-positioned if it does, but I just don't think that the \u2013 I think there is going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still on the early iterations. We have more capability to add to GEN5, it's \u2013 we've been adding \u2013 have for awhile added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy, especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s, even past when we get the high end \u2013 EUV, and remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market. Not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capabilities just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam.\nJohn Pitzer: Great color. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, Rick, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment around process control outgrowing WFE, and to me logically, when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and process control would underperform, not any hit to you, but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. And here you've outlined mid-20s kind of growth for the industry, whereas we've heard 37% growth from ASML, we've got 30 plus percent growth from Lam. How in that world does process control outperform? Is it Intel coming back? Is it at mask inspection spend from China, what are the moving parts that can allow that to happen?\nRick Wallace: Yes, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details. But if you \u2013 if we assume the market is, let's say, just pick a number 22% WFE growth this year, what we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is \u2013 will significantly outgrow that. I don't know if it'll be 38%, but it'll probably start with a 3, in terms of what it is. Now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that businesses and calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across his portfolio, I get pulled into them occasionally, but that's the conversation, it\u2019s how can we support that. And when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on to your other question CJ, it's \u2013 of course it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules, it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year. And we know what Intel has said publicly, but it's not just that we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for \u2013 specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in.\nBren Higgins: Yes CJ, I always struggle a little bit with these questions just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, that KLA\u2019s performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went from $50 million to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi-PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus I think that's where the industry is against the $61 million baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks and against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes, I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here, but that's \u2013 I think that's how I see it at this point.\nCJ Muse: Yes. Very helpful. As my follow-up, you alluded to supply constraints or adding on additional capacity. We'd love to hear \u2013 you guys typically run your business to roughly seven months backlog, has that extended? And I guess, how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model, either gross margins of OpEx, if at all? And if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of seven month timeframe, do you have visibility now into the first half of 2022? Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can, now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high end systems, the timing to procure and optical components, and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six, and we're probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today. And capacity is coming online, really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories worldwide. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers, suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around six months of \u2013 in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we\u2019re facing. At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead time. So all those activities are ongoing, and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself.\nCJ Muse: Thanks, Bren.\nBren Higgins: And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of \u2013 I don't see anything falling off anytime soon.\nRick Wallace: Thanks, CJ.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Okay, good afternoon.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In foundry I know most of the discussion has been focused on leading edge, but there is significant wafer tightness on lag in the c-mass technologies 16, 28, 40 nanometer and higher. I know your sweet spot is advanced technologies, but there is some part of the demand strength in process control coming from these bagging-edge processes as capacity gets built out. So what percentage of your business and process control is exposed to mature technology nodes?\nBren Higgins: So the full China, all the business in China I\u2019d classify as mature. And most of that is pretty boundary weighted this year. There is some wafer investment that's happening, there is some memory investment, but I'd still say it's probably greater than 60%, 65% boundary, I don't have it in front of me. And so you've got that, plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue, I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect.\nRick Wallace: Just to add to it. It's not just tight there as you know, it's tight everywhere. And so you do remember years ago, if you think back to when there was one product and that would transition to the next product and people would reuse capabilities, that's really not an option now. And so what you get is that heavily utilization that benefits that sales, but also we see that in service. So that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service.\nHarlan Sur: Great, good insights there. And then as a follow-on, I mean, on the EPC business with \u2013 again with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial focused and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates. I would assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPCs portfolio of products, because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB. And I think last call, I think your view was that x-display that EPC would go 15% this year, but just given the strong demand for analog RF, power transistors, advanced substrates, PCB capacity. Do you guys have a new view of EPC growth for this year?\nRick Wallace: We do. I think you hit it, and again, if you take out the display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by \u2013 and we talked about this in past Harlan, but by 5G largely if you think about it, most of 2020 and early. Now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive. And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that in some other factors that would have contributed to this chip shortage. And so now they're back on and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC as PTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yields, which is really the near-term, the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield.\nBren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that the expectations about \u2013 for EPC are in the mid-teens. So with that reflects some of the growth drivers in growth that we're seeing in the businesses that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half, I think it will be reasonably balanced. We are doing a ERP integration on one of those businesses. And so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that. But pretty consistent level of business, and as I said overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of meet 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're at with those businesses and particularly on that growth, I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those \u2013 in that group really pleased with the operating leverage as well.\nHarlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. You mentioned China and that the activity is mostly foundry. Can you give us an update on how big you see the China sovereign business, how much growth you see coming this year? And how fragmented is it, how many different customers are you seeing that are kind of spread out across that WFE?\nRick Wallace: It would probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented lots of customers.\nJoe Moore: Okay, great.\nRick Wallace: And also included in that Joe \u2013 Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening, where you're in mask, where there some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem.\nJoe Moore: Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then as it comes \u2013 pertains to regulation, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the export controls reform, that's kind of going through. I guess, do you feel like the equipment industry in KLA specifically has kind of a voice in the government in terms of the direction of these things and \u2013 or is it kind of more dictated by the semiconductor customers? Just how big is the lobbying kind of government affairs efforts from the equipment companies these days?\nRick Wallace: Joe, I think what's really happened is there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might've been unilateral action if you go back a year or so. And it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now it's going to be multilateral. It's going to be thoughtful. And we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there's a constructive dialogue around that, and it's not just the semiconductor guys. It's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.\nRick Wallace: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move now to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. On EUV, I\u2019m just curious you talked a lot about process control intensity, clearly benefiting from EUV. But I guess at 3-nanometer, we're starting to see a big step up in the number of EUV layers. Is that something we should think about as maybe an incremental driver is for you guys?\nRick Wallace: Yes, Joe, for sure. I mean, we're having, as you know, the development work, there's a lot of process control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development for our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the radicals and when they're printed that the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of Gen 5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general, that shifts the dynamic. If you thought about a blend between Gen 4 and Gen 5, Gen 4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being Gen 5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on Gen 5 as we move forward. I think we mentioned I the past, Gen 5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced. So those are just two areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges, but in general, the process control challenges as we move forward especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development. So Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers in these no transitions that forced customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements. And so the ability to reuse a lot of the capacity they might've purchased in a prior node is harder because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening. Today, particularly at the 5-nanometre node, but then also the technical drivers of that, even if they could use the tool, it doesn't meet the technical requirements. So that's another factor that drives intensity, that's pretty important to our overall business.\nJoe Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then maybe one for Bren, on the capacity increasing for your manufacturing footprint, I mean, how do we think about your planning in terms of, supporting overall WFE? Because I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about sustained growth looking even into next year?\nBren Higgins: Yes. Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the windows that we talk about. Just in general that we think that we \u2013 there is no upper limit, right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly, there's some time to some of the lead time on our parts, but whether it's facilities, we like to think about people, parts and space at KLA, typically our long-term goal is around parts around some of the components we talked about. So we're going to continue to add capacity and send a strong signals into a supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will based on customer readiness and customer expectations. We'll do what we need to continue to support those activities as we go forward, even beyond 2021. So I'm not worried about our ability though. I'm worried with that we're challenged and it's not easy, and there's a lot of work going on here. But at the same time, we know how to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in.\nRick Wallace: Thanks Joe.\nJoe Quatrochi: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats. Rick, not to make you sound old, but you've been in this industry for awhile given that you've seen previous cycles and how they've acted in terms of these kinds of first volumes, where you've had to accelerate capacity. Bren, just mentioned that he's not particularly worried about meeting customer demand, but as we get into the secular change in terms of the industry where we may have sustained an elevated spending, how do you look at, I guess meeting the challenges of supply as well as meeting customer demand, particularly for both, for new tools for their needs, how do you manage potentially an extended period of spending at very elevated levels?\nRick Wallace: Yes, Patrick. Thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle as I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on though, is to look at follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right. So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean, there are some examples where customers are investing in, and we see this in China where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment. But those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it presumes it's growth at a more reasonable, upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of modeled. But the step up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think that the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives. And that's really the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick?\nPatrick Ho: No, that's very helpful. And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you the follow-up as well. As we look forward and we know process control does get, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of Gen 5. As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes, the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition of structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?\nRick Wallace: Yes, I think it's a great question. Just as you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance, to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate all around is an interesting one, because there it's actually an adaptation to Gen 4, that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices. So we think that'll be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall, and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60/40, maybe even 65/35, that it'll be the advanced design rules that drive it more. And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing, even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that will base anytime soon.\nPatrick Ho: Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks a lot. I guess, I had the first question was on the whole e-beam versus optical thing. Applied to launch the enlightened tool in March and idea that you combine optical and e-beam and you do synchronizing to sort of determine what defects matter. You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with the eSL10. So I guess, conceptually, it's not new, but they had a pretty strong e-beam review presence. So I guess in theory, that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market and your position?\nRick Wallace: Yes, Tim. Thank you for remembering what we said in 2019. I could go back even further when we introduced some spec back years and years ago, and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the 90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that \u2013 the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is, do you have systemic defects? Do you really \u2013 can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the AI? If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean, there are very few, so you need to cover a lot of area. And that's what optical is really good at. The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA sweet-spot for years, and we continue to do that. So I don't think that the announcement of two and a half year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary, other than \u2013it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability, the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of, and that'll help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has in general, we'll be able to move forward. But I don't think this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might've been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks, Rick. And then, I guess just last thing for me, so service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total, rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys given the nature of their technologies, some of their tools eat themselves. So, obviously it's sort of like apples and oranges there, but some of them also were sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that. And they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster? Thanks.\nRick Wallace: Yes, Tim. I mean, I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that, and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for \u2013 when customers buy process control, they buy what they need. And then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure and ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to the process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the \u2013 in the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements. Particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today, with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required. And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement. That's happening through our service business with those customers to support the install base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you see them staying in service. And that's what, it's probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer. And some of these other markets are inflecting.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. You will be at your 2023 target model this year, basically two years ahead, but that seems to have been driven a lot more by market growth, rather than I think in your target model, you had penciled in one to two points of share gains. And I know Rick, you highlighted a third-party survey that had your share kind of slipping a little bit last year. I'm just curious, when do you think we should start expecting share gains for you over the next few years. And will that be driven by the launch of new products or will that be driven by share in a like-to-like category, will that be driven by spending being more foundry/logic based. Just how do we think about what you had talked about share gains at the analyst day versus what you have seen so far and how we should think about this share shift over the next one to two years?\nRick Wallace: Yes, Vivek, I'll take the first part and let Bren talk about model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the analyst day. In 2019, we gained 3.3 \u2013 3% share and that got a 0.7 down. This is what the survey says, but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year. So I mean, these things move \u2013 annually it\u2019s kind of hard because there are puts and takes, but competitively we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had today. And then Bren can talk more about the model.\nBren Higgins: From a top line point of view, you're right. It's been \u2013 what's driven, it mostly has been, yes. We had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions. We talked about radical inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the radical inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenues, almost irrespective of the WFE level. If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call the normal products and the regular products and share opportunities driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about 2021 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products. So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still coming over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that. And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue, that's growing what we saw in calendar 2020, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about four points in operating margin today. Do I think that that's sustainable at four points? Probably not, but do I think there's a couple points for sure sustainability there, I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. So yes, we're I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters.\nVivek Arya: If I can squeeze in a quick one, automotive, from your perspective, when do you think the automotive industry is able to address all these supply shortages that it's seeing from the semiconductor industry?\nRick Wallace: I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand. But I know that, there've been contributing factors and you've heard of some of them. Projects that weren't started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than them and retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but they're the best people to ask for that.\nBren Higgins: Thanks Vivek.\nOperator: Sorry, I\u2019m just going to conclude the Q&A and turn the call back to you, Kevin.\nKevin Kessel: Yes. Sorry about that. Again, we appreciate everybody's time. We know it's been a bit very busy week for earnings, very busy day for earnings. Won't be busy this summer here with a lot of investor events, we look forward to seeing you again then. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation March Quarter\u2026",

            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining KLA's earning calls today. KLA's March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst the dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers, and shareholders. We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customer's needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA's record results in momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership, two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce, and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model. Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading-edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. In this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we are experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business. KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations. KLA's market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies, and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control. Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCP product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailored to the automotive industry. This quarter expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward. Calendar year 2021 is position to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customer's plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, but the demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers drive to innovate and continuing to invest in future technology notes. Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA's share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA's market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show, KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum and gains EBM inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic, the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors, driving equipment spending. KLA's market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading-edge. Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our electronics packaging and components or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor \u2013 the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors, and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA strengthened our engagement with the top five semiconductor market leaders in packaging. And we're expanding our reach with those sets. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid a $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11 consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA's March, 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation with our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding and customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said, and we view process control in 2021 is outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 \u2013 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the gardener data, as we highlighted over time, KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but \u2013 and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we're also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so, so we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall at a corporate level you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength. Yes, thanks, John. I think the \u2013 I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. There is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi beam \u2013 e-beam solution are KLA, we're the ones that have it, that we're developing and introducing in the radical space which is I think \u2013 where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change, the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that Bren and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which has it slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition, it hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make at e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam \u2013 pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea, that's been around quite a while, and at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening. Yes. John, I \u2013 again, I don't think the world is going to move large scale to e-beam. I mean, we're well-positioned if it does, but I just don't think that the \u2013 I think there is going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still on the early iterations. We have more capability to add to GEN5, it's \u2013 we've been adding \u2013 have for awhile added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy, especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s, even past when we get the high end \u2013 EUV, and remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market. Not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capabilities just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam. Yes, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details. But if you \u2013 if we assume the market is, let's say, just pick a number 22% WFE growth this year, what we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is \u2013 will significantly outgrow that. I don't know if it'll be 38%, but it'll probably start with a 3, in terms of what it is. Now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that businesses and calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across his portfolio, I get pulled into them occasionally, but that's the conversation, it's how can we support that. And when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on to your other question CJ, it's \u2013 of course it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules, it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year. And we know what Intel has said publicly, but it's not just that we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for \u2013 specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in. Thanks, CJ. Just to add to it. It's not just tight there as you know, it's tight everywhere. And so you do remember years ago, if you think back to when there was one product and that would transition to the next product and people would reuse capabilities, that's really not an option now. And so what you get is that heavily utilization that benefits that sales, but also we see that in service. So that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service. We do. I think you hit it, and again, if you take out the display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by \u2013 and we talked about this in past Harlan, but by 5G largely if you think about it, most of 2020 and early. Now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive. And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that in some other factors that would have contributed to this chip shortage. And so now they're back on and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC as PTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yields, which is really the near-term, the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield. It would probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented lots of customers. And also included in that Joe \u2013 Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening, where you're in mask, where there some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem. Joe, I think what's really happened is there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might've been unilateral action if you go back a year or so. And it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now it's going to be multilateral. It's going to be thoughtful. And we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there's a constructive dialogue around that, and it's not just the semiconductor guys. It's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is. Thank you. Yes, Joe, for sure. I mean, we're having, as you know, the development work, there's a lot of process control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development for our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the radicals and when they're printed that the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of Gen 5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general, that shifts the dynamic. If you thought about a blend between Gen 4 and Gen 5, Gen 4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being Gen 5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on Gen 5 as we move forward. I think we mentioned I the past, Gen 5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced. So those are just two areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges, but in general, the process control challenges as we move forward especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development. So Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers in these no transitions that forced customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements. And so the ability to reuse a lot of the capacity they might've purchased in a prior node is harder because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening. Today, particularly at the 5-nanometre node, but then also the technical drivers of that, even if they could use the tool, it doesn't meet the technical requirements. So that's another factor that drives intensity, that's pretty important to our overall business. Thanks Joe. Yes, Patrick. Thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle as I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on though, is to look at follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right. So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean, there are some examples where customers are investing in, and we see this in China where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment. But those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it presumes it's growth at a more reasonable, upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of modeled. But the step up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think that the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives. And that's really the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick? Yes, I think it's a great question. Just as you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance, to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate all around is an interesting one, because there it's actually an adaptation to Gen 4, that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices. So we think that'll be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall, and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60/40, maybe even 65/35, that it'll be the advanced design rules that drive it more. And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing, even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that will base anytime soon. Yes, Tim. Thank you for remembering what we said in 2019. I could go back even further when we introduced some spec back years and years ago, and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the 90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that \u2013 the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is, do you have systemic defects? Do you really \u2013 can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the AI? If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean, there are very few, so you need to cover a lot of area. And that's what optical is really good at. The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA sweet-spot for years, and we continue to do that. So I don't think that the announcement of two and a half year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary, other than \u2013it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability, the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of, and that'll help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has in general, we'll be able to move forward. But I don't think this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might've been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers. Yes, Tim. I mean, I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that, and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for \u2013 when customers buy process control, they buy what they need. And then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure and ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to the process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the \u2013 in the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements. Particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today, with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required. And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement. That's happening through our service business with those customers to support the install base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you see them staying in service. And that's what, it's probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer. And some of these other markets are inflecting. Yes, Vivek, I'll take the first part and let Bren talk about model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the analyst day. In 2019, we gained 3.3 \u2013 3% share and that got a 0.7 down. This is what the survey says, but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year. So I mean, these things move \u2013 annually it's kind of hard because there are puts and takes, but competitively we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had today. And then Bren can talk more about the model. I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand. But I know that, there've been contributing factors and you've heard of some of them. Projects that weren't started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than them and retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but they're the best people to ask for that."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range is stronger revenue in favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million to the June quarter. We were budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter or the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years. We expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%, and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 28% year-over-year with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection. Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agents. In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January, where we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low-to-mid 20s with a bias to the upside at calendar 2021 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments. Also in earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year 2021. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021, relative to the overall WFE market. Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenues expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.8. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. In closing the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets in a multiple technology nodes. We're encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment. KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we're on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustain technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Yes, Krish. Thanks for the comments. Hey, I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why I put the baseline in there. So I said that against the baseline of 2020 of $61 billion, we saw a \u2013 we see growth from there in the low-to-mid 20s percentile as \u2013 with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that, that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE, and certainly the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments. So we feel pretty good, not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us, we have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry. Yes, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business. And as Rick just mentioned and that's a richer business for us overall. So that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It's still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC, and so that's diluted from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities \u2013 the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year, certainly the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about on prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more biased to the upper end of that range. So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth and optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business. John, I'd just add \u2013 I'm sorry, just one other thing \u2013 I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right, so we talked about the accelerated growth relative to the market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right, that's the market, that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So to give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here, that's validating, I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways. Yes CJ, I always struggle a little bit with these questions just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, that KLA's performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went from $50 million to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi-PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus I think that's where the industry is against the $61 million baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks and against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes, I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here, but that's \u2013 I think that's how I see it at this point. Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can, now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high end systems, the timing to procure and optical components, and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six, and we're probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today. And capacity is coming online, really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories worldwide. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers, suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around six months of \u2013 in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we're facing. At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead time. So all those activities are ongoing, and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of \u2013 I don't see anything falling off anytime soon. So the full China, all the business in China I'd classify as mature. And most of that is pretty boundary weighted this year. There is some wafer investment that's happening, there is some memory investment, but I'd still say it's probably greater than 60%, 65% boundary, I don't have it in front of me. And so you've got that, plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue, I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%. Yes, Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that the expectations about \u2013 for EPC are in the mid-teens. So with that reflects some of the growth drivers in growth that we're seeing in the businesses that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half, I think it will be reasonably balanced. We are doing a ERP integration on one of those businesses. And so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that. But pretty consistent level of business, and as I said overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of meet 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're at with those businesses and particularly on that growth, I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those \u2013 in that group really pleased with the operating leverage as well. Yes. Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the windows that we talk about. Just in general that we think that we \u2013 there is no upper limit, right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly, there's some time to some of the lead time on our parts, but whether it's facilities, we like to think about people, parts and space at KLA, typically our long-term goal is around parts around some of the components we talked about. So we're going to continue to add capacity and send a strong signals into a supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will based on customer readiness and customer expectations. We'll do what we need to continue to support those activities as we go forward, even beyond 2021. So I'm not worried about our ability though. I'm worried with that we're challenged and it's not easy, and there's a lot of work going on here. But at the same time, we know how to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in. From a top line point of view, you're right. It's been \u2013 what's driven, it mostly has been, yes. We had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions. We talked about radical inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the radical inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenues, almost irrespective of the WFE level. If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call the normal products and the regular products and share opportunities driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about 2021 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products. So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still coming over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that. And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue, that's growing what we saw in calendar 2020, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about four points in operating margin today. Do I think that that's sustainable at four points? Probably not, but do I think there's a couple points for sure sustainability there, I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. So yes, we're I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters. Thanks Vivek."

As many of you now know, we changed the format of our earnings two quarters ago to include pre-publishing a detailed shareholder letter that provides updates on our business performance. The pre-publishing allows this call to be efficient by providing more streamlined comments while also freeing up more time for your questions and answers. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA. As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it\u2019s important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen and while our teams have not been physically together for the most part; our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever. In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA\u2019s record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow, while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remained focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong returns to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market. Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I\u2019d like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the December quarter, we saw a diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging, and Components group met its target and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage. We ended the year with strong backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We are operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers\u2019 technology roadmaps and enhancing their return on capital investment. Moving to today\u2019s demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several Semiconductor and Electronics industry growth drivers that we have been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics, and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation in advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices, as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB, and finished die inspection in our EPC Group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world. As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that\u2019s remained a constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives. Let\u2019s turn now to five top highlights for our -- in our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw a continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA\u2019s essential role in supporting our customers\u2019 drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. Second, we are seeing strong momentum in the marketplace from new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC Groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment and EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio such as EUV print check for GEN5 and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of X-ray technologies for metrology applications. Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our install base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC Group. The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet and we have seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generates strong operating leverage and cash flows. Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC Group, demonstrating success and KLA\u2019s growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio, and addressing fast growing new markets in the Electronics value chain such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the Electronics value chain as well. The EPC Group ended the year with record backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned to $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow. Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we have adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength, while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The Semiconductor and Electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest, which was being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I will pass the call over to Bren.\nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. KLA\u2019s December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, a very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 billion to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, probably, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27. Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs, as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs. Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given topline expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States and we will provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future. Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC Group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment including its associated Service business was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows; foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM. Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether our customers in one category or another given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry-reporting practices. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020, as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA return $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million and share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to guidance as we begin the New Year, our view is that the fab -- wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth. Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year. Our March quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million; foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of semi process control systems\u2019 revenue; memory is expected to be approximately 32%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25%, as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume will lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $155 million shares. In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guide our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, if you could provide the instructions for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much and a belated Happy New Year and congrats to you guys. Rick, maybe first off, in terms of process control intensity, we have seen foundry and logic continue to grow as we go through these node migrations. And NAND flash has obviously seen intensity rise with the increasing layer counts. As we look at DRAM and the projected pickup that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what types of process control intensity increases are you seeing in that marketplace? Maybe even excluding some of the EUV options that are out there, what other types of process control intensity trends are increasing in DRAM?\nRick Wallace: Sure. I think that there -- if you think about DRAM, what they have really been pushing on and it\u2019s very difficult as you know to do it is to continue scaling and we do think that there is going to be some EUV that comes in. But there is no question that there is scaling happening, and of course, that drives more process control intensity. The other thing that\u2019s pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we are seeing increased -- trying to understand how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they have got. And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there will be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that\u2019s what we are seeing as a trend. It\u2019s not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we would see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick?\nPatrick Ho: Hey. It does, Rick. Thank you. Bren, as a follow-up to that question, you guys as you are seeing demand pickup and revenues grow, your working capital metrics have actually also improved. What changes have you made, particularly given that you have added Orbotech over the last few years, but you see the inventory turns actually improving even as demand picks up. What are some of the dynamics there?\nBren Higgins: Well, hey, Patrick. It\u2019s a great question. And certainly adding Orbotech in and I think we have done a pretty good job of improving overall asset velocity in that business so far. I think there is room for us to improve it going forward. But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model. Both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products but also that enables our service business. So we have always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we are supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships and a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said protect differentiation. So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments and we carry that risk, if you will. Although, we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength of the Service business we tend to move the part. So we think it\u2019s a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. And the volume we have seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It\u2019s -- this is not a turns business for the most part. So I think there\u2019s probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on and I think we have improved it a little bit over time.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to your comment about revenues should be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2021. Is that a process control tool comment as well, I guess what I am trying to understand is, what you are seeing relative to maybe peers talking about WFE being a little bit more first half weighted?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. Joe, so it\u2019s a good question. So what we are trying to do, first of all, it\u2019s really for both groups of our business, if you look at the EPC Group and as well as the process control equipment part of the business. I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we are guiding March and we have got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for \u201821 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I am not guiding the June quarter, I am not guiding September, I am not guiding December, but what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment, the customer acceptance, the consignment buyout and so on. But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view, and I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement.\nJoe Quatrochi: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you talked about the other investments you are making on the product development side, and clearly, you guys are strongly outperforming your long-term profitability targets. I was curious, how do you think about opportunities to maybe even spend a little bit more and accelerate some of the product development projects you have got going on?\nBren Higgins: Sounds like you have been talking to some of our guys inside it. Sometimes Rick and I are the only two people in the company, I think, we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio. So we have ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that\u2019s driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at \u201821 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on. So I think that that\u2019s been an area of focus for us. But we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements and it\u2019s worked pretty well for KLA. I think what\u2019s driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic. And so, I think, the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we are adding to our customers. So hopefully that answers your question.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess two questions if I could put them together. The first one would be around EUV shortages at ASML, is that impacting GEN5 optical demand at all? And then, I guess, secondly, I am a little bit surprised that you are guiding Orbotech business is flat half-on-half, typically there is a seasonal uplift into the back half. I am curious if that\u2019s a conservative outlook, whether seasonality has changed or there is something that we should be kind of thinking about? Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Yeah. CJ, nicely done, those are not related at all, those two questions, as you know. But I will take them. The first one, no, we don\u2019t see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5, if anything, it\u2019s kind of gone the other way. What\u2019s happened in the last few months is, I think, the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with the EUV are best approach -- best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity and so we are actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5, we don\u2019t see any delay in that and we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that. In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, I would say, it\u2019s a complicated business overall to aggregate and so we don\u2019t really see anything, any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlaid at the Investor Day and we are on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it. We will have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand just the dynamics of the Orbotech business. But we feel good about the signs that we are seeing, and as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year.\nRick Wallace: So, CJ, the only thing that I will add to that is we were guiding it right. This still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter as is -- at a different obviously order of magnitude than our Semiconductor Process Control equipment business. But if you look at what\u2019s driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within specialty, and then just all -- the overall PCB dynamics and how it\u2019s changing relative to integration and packaging and high performance computing. It\u2019s all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses. So while the display business is, I expect a down year in \u201821 versus \u201820, the other businesses are more than making up for it. So I think that, overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year.\nCJ Muse: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for letting me ask the question. First one is for Bren. Bren, I am wondering if you just give a little bit more detail around what happened to mix in the December quarter that drill gross margins a little bit light relative to revenues being at the high end of the range and as we look out beyond March, are there any other mix considerations we should think about as we think about gross margins?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. John, it\u2019s the usual quarter-to-quarter variability. So it was a little bit weaker in the December quarter and you see a bit of a bounce back into the March quarter. So we were 20 basis points below and we just guided 25 basis points over the midpoint or over that 62%. And as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we are operating in the 61.5% to 62% range. So it was really just a function of the products that actually revenue in the quarter. It\u2019s a customer acceptance timing dynamic and not any other reason.\nJohn Pitzer: Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Rick, as my follow up, maybe I will go back to the memory question that Patrick asked first, but ask it a little bit differently. If we are doing the math right, December quarter memory was a new record. You have to go back to kind of June of 2018 to see memory this high, and as you know, we in the investment community always think about that space is being kind of hyper-cyclical. We are willing to underwrite some of the structural drivers in logic and foundry, maybe not as much in memory. When you look at the level of memory business today, how do you kind of parse out where we are in the quote-unquote CapEx cycle for memory versus some of the structural drivers you outlined in Patrick\u2019s answer?\nRick Wallace: Yeah. John, I think, as you know, since we are a little more dependent on technology transition than we are at volume, our answer is a little different, because it has more to do with the migration and the yield challenges associated with advanced nodes and what we see there is a pretty steady commitment toward additional capability to drive next-generation and we are seeing that for multiple players. So I think like a lot of things in this industry KLA\u2019s exposure is -- there is less variability in it based on that fact. And so the volume considerations associated with CapEx impact us less than that. And maybe Bren can give some color on how that looks for the -- as we go through the year.\nBren Higgins: Well, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020 and we saw this increase in the December quarter, which had some breath to it and we expected to see that, so we weren\u2019t surprised by it and then as we look at \u201821, we expect to see growth overall. We articulated our view earlier about just -- we think the DRAM market overall probably grows at a higher percentage level than in the flash market, but we would expect to see growth in the business into \u201821. But it\u2019s been pretty disciplined. So seen it bounce back in the December quarter and some sustainability here at these levels as we move through the first part, at least here of \u201821, it\u2019s encouraging.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them to Rick. Just to follow along the thought process on memory, it seems like KLA the way it is today is relatively more exposed to NAND than DRAM. Do you think that exposure or process control intensity increases in DRAM as DRAM goes more EUV? And if so, how should we think about KLA\u2019s revenue mix and then I had a follow-up.\nRick Wallace: Yeah. I mean, I think, that the differences are pretty slight, in terms of what the drivers are. It\u2019s actually different products that are getting impacted. So if you think about DRAM, we are more -- obviously scaling is more of a factor there and so you will see more of what we are doing in terms of whether it\u2019s GEN5. You don\u2019t really see that and what\u2019s going on in NAND, but you do have some of the new products, we talked about the X-ray technology is really more applicable of that, some of the challenges associated with metrology. And even how it impacts our wafer business or Surfscan business, because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality that those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield. So they are different, I think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they are both kind of increasing at similar amounts.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it.\nBren Higgins: Krish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is, with the introduction of EUV and want to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure. Now that\u2019s one level of investment and is that sustainable over time is I think a challenge for our teams. But as customers start to deploy EUV, it will require EUV related infrastructure to help manage that. So that\u2019s a factor that\u2019s out there that also a -- maybe a change moving forward.\nKrish Sankar: Fair enough, Bren. And then another follow up for you on Services. In the shareholder letter, you spoke about how the Services attach rate grew from 70% to over 75% through the course of last year. I am just curious how high can it realistically get or put it another way, Service is running at 25% of total sales, can it get to over 30%? Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Well, Krish, it will. It\u2019s two separate questions. It will because it\u2019s growing faster than the underlying systems business. If you look at our service model, it\u2019s a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day and I\u2019d argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we have seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward. There is clearly customers are valuing the service offerings particularly as you are seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and that with the need for those customers to keep those tools up. A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing increasing reliability requirements and that\u2019s driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking -- look 80%, 85%, I think, that\u2019s probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There is always dynamics of certain customers that prefer billable model and so we will have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure. At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through cycle profitability. So that\u2019s what we aspire to. So I think there\u2019s opportunities but I think there\u2019s always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers will prefers a total structure in parts of their installed base.\nRick Wallace: Just to add to that, I mean, one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it\u2019s pretty much service your own car today, 15 years ago it might have been different. And so you think about over time, the complexity in the associative, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system and it just becomes more economical to rely on us. And then there is no question that a service model -- a customer benefits from having a contract over the long-term. They take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime. So I agree with, Bren, I think it goes up over time. But nothing moves particularly fast in the Services world given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we are firmly convinced and committed to driving it.\nKrish Sankar: Very helpful. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren.\nRick Wallace: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First is, if I take your March quarter outlook and annualize it, it suggests this calendar year growth in line with WFE growth. But when I look at some of the investments that are being made and 5-nanometer and then 3-nanometer on the foundry side and then the DRAM, which is more kind of logic like. I am curious what are the prospects of outgrowing WFE? I guess it\u2019s the process control intensity question just asked in a different way, like, what would help you grow above or below WFE this year?\nRick Wallace: So when I look at it, Vivek, I think, that there is -- we have a little bit more memory investment this year than in \u201820 and so that puts downward pressure on process control intensity. But you are right about the opportunities in foundry/logic and some of the product offerings that we expect to have over the course of 2021. So when I look at it and I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we will probably do a little bit better. There\u2019s some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at \u201821. But overall, I think that that\u2019s where process control intensity kind of plays out. And then from a share if we execute, I think, there\u2019s probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I do think KLA\u2019s share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at \u201821 from where we sit today.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And a follow up is a question on cash returns to shareholders, your profitability is very analog semi like, right, almost 37%, 38% operating margins, but free cash flow returns are -- do leave a lot more room for improvement, even when I look at the buybacks that you had in December, they were somewhat lower than the average we have seen in the last two years. So I am curious, how are you looking at cash returns going forward, if you are going to have such strong growth this year and the longer term trends are there, why not look at 100% free cash flow returns and looking at boosting dividends or the buyback?\nBren Higgins: Well, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think, even over time it, every time we get the question, we have been very explicit about how we think about the -- about capital allocation in the company and our belief that generally cash doesn\u2019t get valued unless it\u2019s deployed productively. And so when you look at what we are doing going forward, we expect that, at a minimum, we would be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We were right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you are right, given the growth of the business I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it and we are operating at that level today and so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. I think we have done a pretty good job with that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor, and given the uptick in the business that we are describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here. Now, on the dividend side, A, we have raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in, year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years. We are going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that\u2019s our model and we will -- we do our exercise here and each year and we will continue to do it that way, I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed.\nVivek Arya: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on China. I think China was -- if my math is right, the Chinese revenue was down about 20% quarter-over-quarter after pretty good third quarter but still up very solidly for the year by 20%. What are your expectations for your opportunity in China this year?\nBren Higgins: So, I would expect WFE in China to be flat to up. I am looking at our business levels and they match that. So it -- I would say, it\u2019s very consistent with the profile of 20%, maybe a little bit better and it\u2019s different customers...\nSidney Ho: Okay.\nBren Higgins: \u2026that are investing. But in general, that\u2019s how we see it.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Great. Maybe my follow-up question is related to your target model. You printed operating margin 38%, guiding up to 39% plus, well ahead of your target model and it sounds like you are comfortable with that, you will continue to exceed that. But are there things that we should be aware of that may bring down operating margin as your revenue continue to grow either in next few years in terms of either cost of goods sold side of things, gross margin obviously, offerings expenses side, then we try to normalize a little bit over the next few years? Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Well, there is always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. But when you look at our long-term plan of growing our top line at least in the 7% to 9% range and dropping 1.5 times that revenue growth rate in terms of EPS growth. But that drives effectively an incremental operating margin that\u2019s between 40% and 50% and that\u2019s how we are going to run the company over time. So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- your gross margin, whether it\u2019s a product mix, obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model we put out there. So, yes, we are outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we have seen in the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business. And I think that a lot of, as I said earlier and said in the prepared remarks, a lot of its sustainable. So that\u2019s our model and we are outperforming it and expect to over the next number of quarters as I outlined.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Bren, I am sorry, you might have already talked about this, but I actually jumped on late. So it seems like if you are going to hold WFE share pretty flat, which I think is pretty reasonable in the 6.3% or 6.4% range. It seems like process control shipments are going to be or revenue is going to be in the 1.05% range for March and then it\u2019s going to sort of stay in that range throughout the rest of the year. So you are not going to see this pronounced half-on-half decline that maybe some others will. Is that sort of the right way to think about the semis process piece?\nBren Higgins: So, Tim, yeah, you missed it. I covered it earlier and there were some prepared remarks that I had that were about a sustained or a consistent demand profile over the next number of quarters. So that isn\u2019t guidance but that was just to give some context on how we see the year shaping up. Notwithstanding the issue that we have around, just general ASPs of our tools that can cause some variability quarter-to-quarter. If you look at the March quarter, and again, we run the -- we guide one revenue number, but my expectations around the semi process control business are somewhere between 1.435% and 1.455% including Service, somewhere in that ballpark.\nTimothy Arcuri: Including service. Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Yeah.\nTimothy Arcuri: And then, I had a question on NAND, so I know you don\u2019t have a ton of visibility there. But your commentary that NAND is going to be sort of the weakest in terms of the relative end markets on a year-over-year basis this year is kind of interesting. I think some others are beginning to try to say the same thing, it sounds like about flat as the growing consensus. There was a pretty big budget flush from one of the big customers in the fourth quarter, so that was higher. But I guess my question is, is your view on NAND is it, because things have been cut, so because the procurement has been cut later on in the year as to why it\u2019s flat or is it because the number\u2019s the same, it\u2019s just as off of the bigger base in 2020? Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Yeah. I think there is some growth in NAND. It\u2019s the lowest percentage growth rate of the three segments that we articulated. So I think it\u2019s probably a mid-single-digit type growth rate and that\u2019s obviously off a bigger base as we look at \u201821.\nTimothy Arcuri: But it\u2019s not because things have been cut, Bren, that\u2019s what I guess.\nBren Higgins: No.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay.\nBren Higgins: I am not so sure I understand the question. But I think it\u2019s been fairly consistent I think here. I think it upticked a little bit in the second half to your point and I think that there is some growth next year off of \u201820.\nTimothy Arcuri: Cool. Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In 2019 in Semiconductor Process Control, you guys gained about 300 basis points of share on the systems side. Revenue-wise you were about 5 times larger than your nearest competitor. It looks like your process control systems business grew about 17% in 2020. Do you guys think you sustained or gained overall process control market share in 2020 and then what areas do you think you drove the most share gains, then on your view of double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2021, what are going to be the fastest growing segments within process control?\nRick Wallace: Harlan, I think, it kind of -- there\u2019s kind of two ways to answer it. What were the end drivers for it and what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn\u2019t necessarily the only thing BBP is used for. So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We will see what the final numbers come out. But you remember, Investor Day we are modeling a slower growth in share than what we are actually seeing. So we feel really good about...\nHarlan Sur: Right.\nRick Wallace: \u2026where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar \u201820. As you shift to \u201821, we feel like we are well-positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had. Again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable and we feel good about how we are positioned there. So I think that you are right, we gained more in \u201819 than in 2020. We held our gains may be built on it a little and I think we are positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our \u201823 plan but, certainly, for \u201821. That\u2019s the way the year\u2019s lining up. That\u2019s we are build plans look right now.\nBren Higgins: Yeah. The product families overall\u2026\nHarlan Sur: Yeah. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: \u2026all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma in the strength there. Because of the memory uptick we are seeing and after a couple of years now of digesting, we are seeing more patterned inspection or unpatterned inspection investment and so that\u2019s a good indicator both to support the wafer output, but also which memory tends to drive wafer so that drives that business. And then the tool monitoring that is done with un-patterned inspectors for any monitor wafers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insight there. And on the EPC side, I spot very good diversification to the business. Going back to the 2019 Analyst Day, the team\u2019s outlook for EPC was kind of like a 9% to 10% CAGR, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in revenues in 2023. Based on the results that you put up in 2020, looks like you guys grew that business about 10%, 11%, if you included the full quarter of Orbotech in your March 2019 quarter. So we can see the team tracking to or slightly ahead of those targets. What sort of growth are you guys expecting for EPC this year, would it be more in line with that 9% to 10% CAGR that you have been targeting or could it be more in line with the overall topline growth of sort of mid-teens and what segments are going to be driving the largest growth in any segments that will lag the growth?\nRick Wallace: Sure. Harlan, great question. We do feel good about where we are positioned. And as you know, I think we are fully integrated now and feel really good about the message we have for our customers. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we feel good about the progress we have made on the synergies. We have seen the target that we laid out in 2023, we are on track. But to your point and Bren mentioned it, FPD will be down in calendar \u201821, which means -- and we think overall, the rest of the business if you take out FPD probably be up closer to 15%. So -- and FPD was relatively weak in \u201820. So the parts of the business that were I think the most levered to in terms of the advanced packaging and a lot of the work that\u2019s going on, where we have overlap with some of our existing front-end customers, really a lot of good progress, and as you know, Oreste is running that. I think he\u2019s confident that we can build on our success as we go forward, based on the interactions that we are having with customers. We feel good about specialty, PCB has been great and we have been really happy with the work that\u2019s going on in the packaging inspection, the ICOS businesses. So those three are really hitting it and feel really good about it. I also mentioned, we are seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously those are lower profitability businesses but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thank you.\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Harlan. Priscilla, looks like we are coming up on time here, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: We will take our final question today from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Someone addressed it in answering Harlan\u2019s question there, but I was looking at the wafer inspection business up 32%. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what\u2019s driving that strength. Is it mostly GEN5? Is it Surfscan? And in the script, I think, you also mentioned some new applications in optical inspection? So I was just looking for some more color there.\nBren Higgins: Yeah. It\u2019s really related, Quinn, to the optical inspection in GEN4, GEN5. So it\u2019s not just what we are seeing in GEN5. But GEN5 is certainly where we are seeing the increased application around specifically supporting EUV. And there -- that\u2019s -- we laid out that thesis at Investor Day. We haven\u2019t really seen it at that time that we thought the print check. So when customers will print down the EUV and they will validate that image that was going to be an application. We believe there is a big market requirement for. That\u2019s proving to be true and that\u2019s driving a lot of the business success going forward. The other thing that\u2019s happening, of course, as EUV is becoming more prevalent then just in general scaling matters more smaller defects and that pushes the mix toward more GEN5 than perhaps would have been GEN4. So we are benefiting from both of those trends, new applications, additional scaling.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.\nRick Wallace: All right. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time and interest. And I will pass the call back over to Priscilla to end.\nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA. As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it's important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen and while our teams have not been physically together for the most part; our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever. In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA's record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow, while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remained focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong returns to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market. Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I'd like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the December quarter, we saw a diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging, and Components group met its target and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage. We ended the year with strong backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We are operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers' technology roadmaps and enhancing their return on capital investment. Moving to today's demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several Semiconductor and Electronics industry growth drivers that we have been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics, and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation in advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices, as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB, and finished die inspection in our EPC Group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world. As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that's remained a constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives. Let's turn now to five top highlights for our -- in our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw a continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. Second, we are seeing strong momentum in the marketplace from new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC Groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment and EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio such as EUV print check for GEN5 and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of X-ray technologies for metrology applications. Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our install base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC Group. The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet and we have seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generates strong operating leverage and cash flows. Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC Group, demonstrating success and KLA's growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio, and addressing fast growing new markets in the Electronics value chain such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the Electronics value chain as well. The EPC Group ended the year with record backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA's Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned to $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow. Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we have adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength, while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The Semiconductor and Electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest, which was being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I will pass the call over to Bren. Sure. I think that there -- if you think about DRAM, what they have really been pushing on and it's very difficult as you know to do it is to continue scaling and we do think that there is going to be some EUV that comes in. But there is no question that there is scaling happening, and of course, that drives more process control intensity. The other thing that's pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we are seeing increased -- trying to understand how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they have got. And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there will be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that's what we are seeing as a trend. It's not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we would see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick? So, CJ, the only thing that I will add to that is we were guiding it right. This still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter as is -- at a different obviously order of magnitude than our Semiconductor Process Control equipment business. But if you look at what's driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within specialty, and then just all -- the overall PCB dynamics and how it's changing relative to integration and packaging and high performance computing. It's all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses. So while the display business is, I expect a down year in \u201821 versus \u201820, the other businesses are more than making up for it. So I think that, overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year. Yeah. John, I think, as you know, since we are a little more dependent on technology transition than we are at volume, our answer is a little different, because it has more to do with the migration and the yield challenges associated with advanced nodes and what we see there is a pretty steady commitment toward additional capability to drive next-generation and we are seeing that for multiple players. So I think like a lot of things in this industry KLA's exposure is -- there is less variability in it based on that fact. And so the volume considerations associated with CapEx impact us less than that. And maybe Bren can give some color on how that looks for the -- as we go through the year. Yeah. I mean, I think, that the differences are pretty slight, in terms of what the drivers are. It's actually different products that are getting impacted. So if you think about DRAM, we are more -- obviously scaling is more of a factor there and so you will see more of what we are doing in terms of whether it's GEN5. You don't really see that and what's going on in NAND, but you do have some of the new products, we talked about the X-ray technology is really more applicable of that, some of the challenges associated with metrology. And even how it impacts our wafer business or Surfscan business, because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality that those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield. So they are different, I think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they are both kind of increasing at similar amounts. Just to add to that, I mean, one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it's pretty much service your own car today, 15 years ago it might have been different. And so you think about over time, the complexity in the associative, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system and it just becomes more economical to rely on us. And then there is no question that a service model -- a customer benefits from having a contract over the long-term. They take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime. So I agree with, Bren, I think it goes up over time. But nothing moves particularly fast in the Services world given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we are firmly convinced and committed to driving it. Thank you. So when I look at it, Vivek, I think, that there is -- we have a little bit more memory investment this year than in \u201820 and so that puts downward pressure on process control intensity. But you are right about the opportunities in foundry/logic and some of the product offerings that we expect to have over the course of 2021. So when I look at it and I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we will probably do a little bit better. There's some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at \u201821. But overall, I think that that's where process control intensity kind of plays out. And then from a share if we execute, I think, there's probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I do think KLA's share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at \u201821 from where we sit today. Harlan, I think, it kind of -- there's kind of two ways to answer it. What were the end drivers for it and what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn't necessarily the only thing BBP is used for. So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We will see what the final numbers come out. But you remember, Investor Day we are modeling a slower growth in share than what we are actually seeing. So we feel really good about... ...where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar \u201820. As you shift to \u201821, we feel like we are well-positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had. Again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable and we feel good about how we are positioned there. So I think that you are right, we gained more in \u201819 than in 2020. We held our gains may be built on it a little and I think we are positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our \u201823 plan but, certainly, for \u201821. That's the way the year's lining up. That's we are build plans look right now. Sure. Harlan, great question. We do feel good about where we are positioned. And as you know, I think we are fully integrated now and feel really good about the message we have for our customers. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we feel good about the progress we have made on the synergies. We have seen the target that we laid out in 2023, we are on track. But to your point and Bren mentioned it, FPD will be down in calendar \u201821, which means -- and we think overall, the rest of the business if you take out FPD probably be up closer to 15%. So -- and FPD was relatively weak in \u201820. So the parts of the business that were I think the most levered to in terms of the advanced packaging and a lot of the work that's going on, where we have overlap with some of our existing front-end customers, really a lot of good progress, and as you know, Oreste is running that. I think he's confident that we can build on our success as we go forward, based on the interactions that we are having with customers. We feel good about specialty, PCB has been great and we have been really happy with the work that's going on in the packaging inspection, the ICOS businesses. So those three are really hitting it and feel really good about it. I also mentioned, we are seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously those are lower profitability businesses but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well. Thanks, Harlan. Priscilla, looks like we are coming up on time here, I think we have time for one last question. All right. We appreciate everybody's time and interest. And I will pass the call back over to Priscilla to end."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, a very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 billion to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, probably, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27. Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs, as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs. Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given topline expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States and we will provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future. Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC Group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment including its associated Service business was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows; foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM. Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether our customers in one category or another given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry-reporting practices. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020, as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA return $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million and share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to guidance as we begin the New Year, our view is that the fab -- wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth. Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year. Our March quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million; foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of semi process control systems' revenue; memory is expected to be approximately 32%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25%, as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume will lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $155 million shares. In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guide our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Well, hey, Patrick. It's a great question. And certainly adding Orbotech in and I think we have done a pretty good job of improving overall asset velocity in that business so far. I think there is room for us to improve it going forward. But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model. Both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products but also that enables our service business. So we have always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we are supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships and a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said protect differentiation. So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments and we carry that risk, if you will. Although, we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength of the Service business we tend to move the part. So we think it's a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. And the volume we have seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It's -- this is not a turns business for the most part. So I think there's probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on and I think we have improved it a little bit over time. Yeah. Joe, so it's a good question. So what we are trying to do, first of all, it's really for both groups of our business, if you look at the EPC Group and as well as the process control equipment part of the business. I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we are guiding March and we have got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for \u201821 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I am not guiding the June quarter, I am not guiding September, I am not guiding December, but what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment, the customer acceptance, the consignment buyout and so on. But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view, and I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement. Sounds like you have been talking to some of our guys inside it. Sometimes Rick and I are the only two people in the company, I think, we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio. So we have ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that's driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at \u201821 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on. So I think that that's been an area of focus for us. But we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements and it's worked pretty well for KLA. I think what's driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic. And so, I think, the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we are adding to our customers. So hopefully that answers your question. Yeah. CJ, nicely done, those are not related at all, those two questions, as you know. But I will take them. The first one, no, we don't see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5, if anything, it's kind of gone the other way. What's happened in the last few months is, I think, the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with the EUV are best approach -- best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity and so we are actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5, we don't see any delay in that and we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that. In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, I would say, it's a complicated business overall to aggregate and so we don't really see anything, any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlaid at the Investor Day and we are on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it. We will have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand just the dynamics of the Orbotech business. But we feel good about the signs that we are seeing, and as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year. Yeah. John, it's the usual quarter-to-quarter variability. So it was a little bit weaker in the December quarter and you see a bit of a bounce back into the March quarter. So we were 20 basis points below and we just guided 25 basis points over the midpoint or over that 62%. And as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we are operating in the 61.5% to 62% range. So it was really just a function of the products that actually revenue in the quarter. It's a customer acceptance timing dynamic and not any other reason. Well, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020 and we saw this increase in the December quarter, which had some breath to it and we expected to see that, so we weren't surprised by it and then as we look at \u201821, we expect to see growth overall. We articulated our view earlier about just -- we think the DRAM market overall probably grows at a higher percentage level than in the flash market, but we would expect to see growth in the business into \u201821. But it's been pretty disciplined. So seen it bounce back in the December quarter and some sustainability here at these levels as we move through the first part, at least here of \u201821, it's encouraging. Krish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is, with the introduction of EUV and want to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure. Now that's one level of investment and is that sustainable over time is I think a challenge for our teams. But as customers start to deploy EUV, it will require EUV related infrastructure to help manage that. So that's a factor that's out there that also a -- maybe a change moving forward. Well, Krish, it will. It's two separate questions. It will because it's growing faster than the underlying systems business. If you look at our service model, it's a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day and I'd argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we have seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward. There is clearly customers are valuing the service offerings particularly as you are seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and that with the need for those customers to keep those tools up. A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing increasing reliability requirements and that's driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking -- look 80%, 85%, I think, that's probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There is always dynamics of certain customers that prefer billable model and so we will have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure. At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through cycle profitability. So that's what we aspire to. So I think there's opportunities but I think there's always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers will prefers a total structure in parts of their installed base. Well, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think, even over time it, every time we get the question, we have been very explicit about how we think about the -- about capital allocation in the company and our belief that generally cash doesn't get valued unless it's deployed productively. And so when you look at what we are doing going forward, we expect that, at a minimum, we would be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We were right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you are right, given the growth of the business I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it and we are operating at that level today and so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. I think we have done a pretty good job with that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor, and given the uptick in the business that we are describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here. Now, on the dividend side, A, we have raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in, year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years. We are going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that's our model and we will -- we do our exercise here and each year and we will continue to do it that way, I don't think anything's changed. So, I would expect WFE in China to be flat to up. I am looking at our business levels and they match that. So it -- I would say, it's very consistent with the profile of 20%, maybe a little bit better and it's different customers... ...that are investing. But in general, that's how we see it. Well, there is always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. But when you look at our long-term plan of growing our top line at least in the 7% to 9% range and dropping 1.5 times that revenue growth rate in terms of EPS growth. But that drives effectively an incremental operating margin that's between 40% and 50% and that's how we are going to run the company over time. So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- your gross margin, whether it's a product mix, obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model we put out there. So, yes, we are outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we have seen in the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business. And I think that a lot of, as I said earlier and said in the prepared remarks, a lot of its sustainable. So that's our model and we are outperforming it and expect to over the next number of quarters as I outlined. So, Tim, yeah, you missed it. I covered it earlier and there were some prepared remarks that I had that were about a sustained or a consistent demand profile over the next number of quarters. So that isn't guidance but that was just to give some context on how we see the year shaping up. Notwithstanding the issue that we have around, just general ASPs of our tools that can cause some variability quarter-to-quarter. If you look at the March quarter, and again, we run the -- we guide one revenue number, but my expectations around the semi process control business are somewhere between 1.435% and 1.455% including Service, somewhere in that ballpark. Yeah. Yeah. I think there is some growth in NAND. It's the lowest percentage growth rate of the three segments that we articulated. So I think it's probably a mid-single-digit type growth rate and that's obviously off a bigger base as we look at \u201821. No. I am not so sure I understand the question. But I think it's been fairly consistent I think here. I think it upticked a little bit in the second half to your point and I think that there is some growth next year off of \u201820. Yeah. The product families overall... ...all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma in the strength there. Because of the memory uptick we are seeing and after a couple of years now of digesting, we are seeing more patterned inspection or unpatterned inspection investment and so that's a good indicator both to support the wafer output, but also which memory tends to drive wafer so that drives that business. And then the tool monitoring that is done with un-patterned inspectors for any monitor wafers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well. Yeah. It's really related, Quinn, to the optical inspection in GEN4, GEN5. So it's not just what we are seeing in GEN5. But GEN5 is certainly where we are seeing the increased application around specifically supporting EUV. And there -- that's -- we laid out that thesis at Investor Day. We haven't really seen it at that time that we thought the print check. So when customers will print down the EUV and they will validate that image that was going to be an application. We believe there is a big market requirement for. That's proving to be true and that's driving a lot of the business success going forward. The other thing that's happening, of course, as EUV is becoming more prevalent then just in general scaling matters more smaller defects and that pushes the mix toward more GEN5 than perhaps would have been GEN4. So we are benefiting from both of those trends, new applications, additional scaling."

At this time, I would like to welcome to the KLA Corporation First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants\u2019 lines have been placed on listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Priscilla and welcome to KLA\u2019s fiscal Q1 2021 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the September quarter and our outlook for the December quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2020 that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All of these documents can be found on the IR section of our Website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR Web site. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information including our quiet period policy and links to KLA\u2019s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA can not guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. We changed the format of these calls last quarter to include pre-publishing a shareholders letter that provide deeper insights into our business. We will also start by providing some streamlined highlights from our full prepared remarks, while still providing more time overall for your questions and answers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As we rapidly approach the end of the calendar year, it's amazing when I stopped to think how much has changed over the last 12 months. I hope you and your families are safe and in good health and I appreciate your continued interest in and support for our company. I want to make sure I begin my remarks today by conveying my appreciation to the worldwide KLA team. It's your perseverance, strive to be better and determination that exemplify KLA's core values and enable us once again to meet our commitments and to deliver exceptionally strong financial performance in the September quarter. On behalf of the entire KLA executive team, I want to thank you. In this quarter's Shareholder Letter that was published today, we highlighted how our results demonstrate the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As many of you may have already seen, our September quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS both finished at the upper end of our guidance, a result of continued strong demand from customers, exceptional execution by our global teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model in guiding our strategic objectives. I'm pleased to say that, we are continuing this momentum into the December quarter and nearing the end of what truly has been an unprecedented year in calendar 2020. Most importantly, we are executing at a high level, operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and are solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. In terms of the resourcefulness of our global workforce, we just completed the third quarter of operating through a pandemic. COVID-19 has presented an unexpected opportunity to showcase KLA\u2019s resilience and resourcefulness in these unprecedented times. We have begun proactively taking steps to mitigate disruption in our business and remain vigilant of the risk posed by the virus to our people. We've done this by adopting strict safety protocols to protect our workforce, while innovating new ways to collaborate with customers and partners. As demonstrated by our strong performance throughout 2020, we are successfully meeting customer needs, executing our R&D roadmap and operating our worldwide manufacturing facilities efficiently. We continue to evaluate and adapt at various facilities in accordance with local regulation, prioritizing employee health and safety. Our worldwide teams deserve praise for never losing sight of what our customers want and need to improve their businesses, and to drive better yield management. We benefited from them being exceptionally resourceful and as always remain committed to customer satisfaction and meeting our commitments. While we consider the challenges our worldwide teams are facing today, we recognize that they extend well beyond the workplace, which makes us intently focused on ensuring that we're supporting our teams and our people in every possible way. Lastly, investment in long term remains an important priority for us. We're confident that our R&D programs will help strengthen our technology and market leadership. And we\u2019re gratified by the effectiveness of our business continuity actions, which have allowed R&D activities to adapt, although ,not without challenges, and to continue through this pandemic. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. In the September quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control revenue was solidly above plan and our services business delivered strong operating leverage and is on track to deliver double digit growth in 2020. We also ended the quarter with strong backlog, reflecting the enabling role KLA plays in our customers\u2019 technology roadmap and investment. Driven by the circular industry trends and the ongoing commitment by our customers to invest in R&D for next generation technology, the stage is set for KLA\u2019s outdoor market in calendar 2020. Today's environment continues to accelerate the adoption of several industry growth drivers that we originally outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. The integration of digital technology into our lives is transforming the way we live and work, resulting in fundamentally change to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This digital transformation is fueling secular demand drivers, such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and accelerated migration to the cloud from on-prem applications, as well as 5G communication, driving investments and innovation in advanced memory and logic device technologies. Process control is on the critical path of enabling this digital transformation, driving our growth and long term revenue and profitability. And the addition of the Orbotech in 2019 to our business portfolio has expanded our exposure to the compelling industry trends. We\u2019re all driving this all important digital transformation in our own business as well, including adopting new productivity tools to improve collaboration with our global teams and customers. For example, our customer service organization has been working closely with customers to expand remote service technologies, which augment our in country service and installation engineers. We\u2019ve also recently adopted and integrated a new cloud based platform for managing our global HR management system that should continue to benefit us as we scale. Finally, we're also integrating cloud based manufacturing and service planning tools to increase the visibility of our parts demand to our suppliers and to allow us to more proactively respond to customer service requirements. Here's just a few examples of the accelerated digital transformation that we ourselves are experiencing inside of KLA as we adapt to this new environment. Here are five top highlights from our most recent quarter. First, as expected, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry and logic demand in the September quarter. These customers are benefiting from investment in digital transformation to support the secular growth drivers that we mentioned earlier. And we expect this demand to remain healthy in 2021. In memory, total utilization is high and memory customers continue to drive down device inventories and plan for higher bit growth in 2021 to meet expected improvement and then demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader range of customers in December quarter with momentum continuing into 2021. Second, we ended the quarter with strong backlog, demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups, fueled by new applications in our optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen5 and the success of our new offerings, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform, we're seeing strong adoption of our patterned wafer inspection product suite, driving our market leadership and what we expect will be a year of growth for process control. Third, our service business continues to perform well and is positioned for double digit growth in 2020. KLA's service revenue is 25% of the total quarterly and is delivering long term growth at a rate that's double the underlying industry WFE growth rate. Fourth, it was another strong quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components group, or EPC, highlighted by the record demand of our PCB division. The strong growth in PCB was driven by EPC's high exposure to the 5G infrastructure and smartphone market. SPTS and ICOS divisions are also benefiting from the transition to 5G along with increasingly the more complex advanced semiconductor packaging. Finally, in keeping with our commitments to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, we announced back in July that our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase. During the September quarter, we returned $329 million to investors via dividends and buybacks. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Bren to get into greater detail on our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges in the year associated with the pandemic, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of our global workforce. We have adapted well and we're very well positioned for a strong finish to 2020. This demonstrates the critical nature of our products and services in enabling the digital transformations of our lives, the resiliency of our business model and return value to our shareholders. We believe the secular factors driving our industry demand that we identified at last year's Investor Day are as relevant now as they were then, and they'll help us enable us to achieve our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long term operating leverage should yield consistent returns for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren.\nBren Higgins: Thanks Rick and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's September quarter results once again demonstrated both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to exhibit our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining robust capital return strategy. Total revenue was $1.54 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03 at the high end of the guided range of $2.42 to $3.06. GAAP EPS was $2.69. Gross margin at 62.1% was 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, as higher semiconductor process control product mix, lower inventory reserve requirements due to strengthening demand and services leveraged, drove the upside realized in the quarter. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.27 billion. In terms of approximate customer segment mix of process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers, foundry was strong as expected at 59%, logic was 10% and memory was 31% in the September quarter. Within memory, the business was split roughly two thirds DRAM and one third NAND. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $89 million, down 11% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. Demand in this segment is driven by growth in RF, MEMs and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $181 million, down 10% sequentially but up 1% year-over-year. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.04 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.45 billion after retiring $50 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $456 million in the September quarter, free cash flow conversion was 96.1% and free cash flow margin was 29.7%. For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow, including $542 million in dividends paid and $789 million in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we repurchased $188 million of common stock and paid $141 million in dividends. As it relates to guidance, our view for WFE growth this year is approximately 10%, growing off a baseline of $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019. Given this and our outlook for revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter, KLA is in position once again to outgrow our industry. Looking forward, no early based on our current backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the first half of calendar '21. We will have more to say about our views of '21 WFE in our January earnings report. Before turning to our specific December quarter guidance, we'd like to comment on the current trade situation regarding United States and China. As you all know, in the September quarter, the US Department of Commerce stated that SMIC, or SMIC, may pose an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end-use in China. So we must obtain an export license prior to shipping certain systems and spare parts to SMIC and certain related parties that are subject to the US export administration regulations. This new license requirement did not have any effect on any shipments in the September quarter. We are complying with the new rules and have already applied for licenses for expected shipments in the December quarter. Given the expected level of business in the quarter subject to license requirements, the result of the license requirements will not have a material impact on revenue. And as a result, we have made no adjustments for this situation to our plans or guidance ranges. The trade situation remains fluid and we've done our best to give you our perspective on the impact to our business and we\u2019ll refrain from speculating on the situation further. Our December quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.585 billion plus or minus $75 million; Foundry is forecasted to be about 52% of semiconductor process control systems revenues for semiconductor customers, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst the foundry customer base; Memory is expected to grow to be approximately 37%: Logic is expected to be about 11%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as we expect similar product mix and services leverage as in the September quarter. The market reception to product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong. And as outlined at our Investor Day last year, the company has made solid progress in our plans at driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. In addition, better than modeled gross margin improvement in acquired businesses is a tailwind to our gross margins overall. Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest in other expenses of approximately $42 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.59 to $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.82 to $3.46, or $3.14 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, KLA is executing well with increasing confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and profitability. Growth in semiconductor revenue looks compelling over the long run with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fill our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, I think we're ready for you to queue for questions, please provide instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Congratulations I just wanted to follow-up, Bren, on your commentary around China. You said the results of licenses will not have a material impact on the December quarter revenue. Is that because you've already adjusted for it in your guidance or you just don't think that most of your shipments to SMIC require a license? And in that same vein, just given that China continues to be extremely strong, I think one of the key investor concerns out there is that the fear of bands are causing customers to pull forward. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the mix of your China business between domestic and multinational and kind of that concern of pull forward?\nBren Higgins: So on the SMIC situation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've applied for licenses for the December quarter where we think we need them. And if you look at just overall, I mean, SMIC, just for some background, it's an important customer but not a particularly large one. And over the last six months or so we've been discussing a broadening of investment. And certainly, they participated in that. There's probably timing factors that are involved in terms of how others are seeing this business come in over the course over the year. But as we look at what we revenued in the September quarter and where there was no effect and then we look at the December quarter, we've applied for licenses, as I said, where we need them. And at the end of the day, when we look at the overall expectation of revenue on our business for the quarter, we just don't see it having a material impact. So we didn't have to adjust anything, frankly. So our plans are consistent overall. So there's no change there. On your second question really difficult in our business. I mean, certainly, demand overall has been very strong. And so when you have a customer try to pull in a delivery, it means that they're taking a slot from another customer. And given the overall demand profile, that is -- most of the customers are sticking with their slots. So we haven't really seen a change. We've been, I think, fairly consistent in our view of shipments for the year of about $800 million. It's been second half loaded. It's what we are seeing today. So I haven't seen much of a change overall in terms of the behavior for customers, at least in regards to our products.\nOperator: And we will take our next question today from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. On the innovation and new product front, there's a good correlation in years where the team rolls out new tools and platforms and then the forward revenue momentum for the next few years. Last year, you guys I think launched about 10 new tools or platforms, second iteration of your Gen5, your new X-ray metrology platform, e-beam inspection platform and also your multi column e-beam inspection for mask inspection, just to kind of name a few. Are these platforms contributing to the incremental upside in revenue performance this year? And how many new platforms do you guys have in development and/or will be introducing over the next 12 months?\nRick Wallace: As you might imagine, these programs are at different points in their life cycle. So yes, we have seen contribution. For example, we talked about print check for EUV with the BBP platform, and that's been a continuation and a broadening of that demand. In other cases, we've talked recently about where we are in terms of the X-ray metrology product or the multi-beam reticle tool. Those are not contributing in a material way to the revenue in the near term, but those are products that we do expect to fuel our growth in '21 and beyond in support of the 2023 plan. In terms of how many programs we have under development, we have a number as always of significant investments going on. But as you might imagine, there are various phases of introduction. But when we laid out our 2023 plan, we're pretty confident that the programs that we've got in place and the ones that are under development are where they need to be in order to support the 2023 plan. The challenges of some of those, as you might imagine, there have been some COVID challenges, which maybe hit us harder early in COVID. And then we -- in terms of program execution. But we feel like we've made great progress in terms of navigating that. And we feel good about where we are, which is why we say we're on track to meet or exceed the '23 plans that we laid on. Bren, do you want to add to that?\nBren Higgins: Harlan, I think one of the things that we're pretty excited about is that over the last year or so, we've introduced platforms in a lot of our core businesses. And those platforms have had really strong market perception. We think you mentioned Gen 5, but also new iterations of the Gen 4 product line and customers mix and matching across both tool sets and supporting a wide variety of designs and different process flows, which has been great for the business. But new laser scattering offerings, you mentioned e-beam, we have a new e-beam inspection product. And the portfolio strategy of the company, as we connect those tools and we leverage common interfaces and common algos, common software, it's been able to, I think, provide a pretty competitive offering out there in the marketplace. And so we've been able to maintain our share. We grew share in 2019. We think we're going to maintain that in '20, maybe improve it a little bit and been able to do it at very strong margins. So certainly, growth in the overall business is a factor there but also the product position is a factor. So we're pretty pleased with what's out in the marketplace. And to Rick's point, we've got some new things coming down the pipe that hopefully will drive our performance against our '23 targets.\nOperator: We will go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: I guess, I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit about the confidence that you have on sustainable spending in the first half of '21. And in particular, I would love to hear your thoughts around foundry and logic contributions. And as part of that, if you could touch on what impact if at all you might see if we see greater spend on 5-nanometer versus 3-nanometer at TSMC? Thank you.\nRick Wallace: As we said in the prepared remarks, we had very strong backlog coming into the quarter. We had a positive book to bill this quarter. And if we look at the funnel of expectations into the December quarter, just the overall order outlook as we look into December and into March and then the backlog position we believe will take into the year, gives us some confidence of sustainability of these business levels. And so while it's early for us to spend a lot of time sizing '21, and we'll have more to say about \u201821 in the next earnings call in January, that overall position gives us confidence that we'll see some sustainability here. From a foundry/logic point of view when you look at the overall market, and there are puts and takes there. But we are pretty confident in the fact that foundry/logic looks like that it has sustainability as we move into the first half of the year, I don't see it changing. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter there's always fluctuation. But in general feel very good about the profile of that business as we move in the first half.\nBren Higgins: And just one thing to add, C.J. I think one of the beliefs and our investment thesis on some of our new capabilities, for example, EUV print check, was that we were going to be highly relevant in the advanced nodes. But of course, people really hadn't hit much volume. So we've really seen proof of that concept. And we're getting a lot of customer pull for capacity and capability to support those ramps, and it's not just at one customer. So we feel very good about the process control intensity expectations that we had going into these nodes. We're seeing them being realized. So we view that as another positive indicator, not just on the overall foundry spend but on the process control related spend.\nRichk Wallace: We would expect Gen 5 to have some growth next year in wafer starts and we also expect to see some, what we call mini line risk production type investment on N3 more towards the middle of the year end, into the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will move to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: I had a question for Rick or Bren. You guys mentioned in your prepared comments memory should see growth next year. I understand you're going to give more color in January. But just within that context, how would you expect KLA revenues to trend? The reason I'm asking is there's a general view that within the memory vertical, KLA has more exposure to NAND than DRAM. So I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on '21 memory and KLA's performance.\nBren Higgins: Really, since the middle of 2018 or so, we've seen very disciplined spending by our memory customers. And so we've seen that continue through after a strong down year in 2019 to a flattish year here in 2020. We see some modest recovery here in the December quarter as you see from the disclosures we gave for the quarter. And we see that continuing as we move into next year. I don't see -- just if you look at the overall pricing environment and certainly the smartphone and timing of data center recovery, we'll have an impact on the overall memory environment. You've got EUV introduction into DRAM, which could be a factor as well as we move into the second half of the year that we would expect to see memory as an improving business for us as we move into '21. As I said, I think that the discipline has been there. And as we start to see pricing recover, I think you'll see more investment there. But I wouldn't say it's a huge expectation in terms of growth but I think a lot of it will be dependent on some of the end market dynamics that I mentioned. From a process control intensity point of view, it's a little bit higher today in 3D flash than DRAM, although the introduction of EUV and DRAM is an opportunity for us to drive process control intensity. So I think we're optimistic about that when we start to see that play out. And then also as stacks, layer counts increase in flash that we will see more opportunities for our metrology product lines. We've got some new product offerings. We also have the e-beam inspection tools. We talked about where things that we believe will ultimately create some opportunities for us for either intensity improvement or share. So I think we're pretty optimistic about those opportunities.\nOperator: And we will move next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Sorry to go back to this, but I just want to make sure I understand the SMIC situation. Are you saying you didn't have exposure in the September quarter? And then, I guess, as you look at these rules, is there sort of an equal impact whether you ship out of the US or whether you ship out of Israel or Singapore?\nBren Higgins: In the September quarter, the change or the notification from the government came in at the very end of September. So there's no impact in the September quarter. And so as we look at the December quarter, as I said earlier, when we have to apply for licenses, we've applied for those. And we don't think that the granting of those licenses within the time frame we're talking about or not, will have a material impact on the business.\nJoe Moore: And is there a difference as to where you ship out of it? Is it a different licensing process, whether you ship out of the US or from a foreign location?\nBren Higgins: Well, the licensing requirement is -- there isn't a licensing requirement that comes from a factor.\nOperator: And we will go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.\nPatrick Ho: Rick or Bren, in terms of your PCB business, it's actually had a few strong quarters and you mentioned that 5G has been a big driver. You've given us the road map and a lot of the development on the process control area. Can you just talk about, I guess, the product road map on that business and because these type of tools typically have a long lifespan. When do you feel the need to call refresh and upgrade it for this next wave of line that's being driven by 5G?\nRick Wallace: It's a great question. And the answer is, we're relatively new to this business. So about year and half year, very impressed with what the Orbotech team had been doing. And I think in conjunction with them, we're really working hard to make sure we have the right amount of investment to continue new products meeting customer needs. And I would say that they had great engagement and we've added that. And as a result, we're investing heavily in that business to make sure that we're meeting some of the emerging demand, the flex PCB and all the new substrates, all the things. This is the beginning, as you know, of the 5G. And we think there's a continued opportunity for system growth over time. So we're very bullish on what that team has done. And in combination, we think it's been a tremendous success so far and a lot of upside as we go forward. But like KLA businesses, it requires continued investment in new capabilities and we're doing that right now.\nOperator: And we will move next to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I had a question about your Semi Systems business. If I sort of take your prior comments about the PCB and the Display business for calendar half-on-half, you said it would be down half-on-half. So that would imply that, that segment is sort of at best flat for December. And that's the biggest piece other than Semi Systems. So it seems like Semi Systems have to be up about 5% to like 9.35 to 9.40 for December? So I guess, A, is that right? And B, assuming it is, then your systems for the year are up about 10%, which is about in line with where we think WFE is? Yet you said that you're outgrowing the market. So I just wanted to see if you can fit those comments. Because it doesn't seem like you're really gaining WFE share this year, and you didn't gain anything last year either in a period where we've seen pretty big mix shifts toward foundry/logic. So I guess, can you sort of speak to that? Thanks.\nBren Higgins: A few questions in there, Tim, and I'll try to answer this for you. Yes, I mean your conclusion around December sequential Semi Systems is right, mid single digits. Obviously, we run the business at a total company level. But in terms of our expectations, it looks like it's sequentially a bit single digit growth here. And so when you take in aggregate, you add all that up that with our semi systems, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15% growth year-over-year against a market environment that's 10%. So that's an outperform. And if you look at last year, WFE was down about 7% and our Semi business was up 1%. So that's an outperform too in 2019. So we can spend some time with you on the math on all of this, but that's how to think about your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Rick, if I look at inspection and measurement, industry sales attach rate to lithography sales historically, it makes a new high as industry introduces newer wave length. As you look at EUV now since introduction at 7-nanometer growing to 26 steps at 3-nanometer and some introduction at DRAM. Do you think the defect challenges associated with EUV remains a tailwind for your process control business or leveling off?\nRick Wallace: I think it's a good question. What we've seen so far, as you know, we're relatively conservative, but we have had indications and we believe earlier in EUV that we would see increased penetration of our advanced optical tools as well as in the mass shop. That's really playing out. So we do model process control intensity going up as a result of increased EUV adoption. And part of why that's working for us is, I mentioned EUV print check. That's essentially kind of a new category where we're able to deploy additional BBP tools to support the RAM of EUV. And as you might imagine, those wafers are incredibly expensive. So there's a a real focus by our customers to make sure that they're obviously optimizing their yield and catching excursions. At the same time, the size of the defect is becoming more relevant and smaller defects. So our tools end up having to run in modes where they capture smaller defects with increased algorithms, which also means that the capacity needs increase as the design rules go down in order to cover and detect. So yes, I would say that those are both tailwinds and our customers tell us that because they're very ambitious about ramping the advanced nodes and wanting to make sure we're in a position to support them. Does that answer your question?\nOperator: We will go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nQuinn Bolton: I wanted to first ask just the patterning business, up 21% sequentially. It looks like it had a pretty strong quarter. Wondering if you could highlight sort of what areas within pattern and really drove that growth? And then I've got a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: Patterning overall, we had a strong quarter in reticle inspection. So quarter to quarter, that was the biggest driver.\nQuinn Bolton: Do you expect that to continue or is that a fairly lumpy business?\nBren Higgins: Well, it's big ASPs. And so it's low integers and big ASPs. And so depending on timing, it does tend to be lumpy. Overall reticle inspection, because of the number of design starts in advanced foundry has been a really strong business for us. So I think that when we look at it overall, it was a very strong year in '19 and '20. It\u2019s down a little bit from '19 in that business but still pretty strong. So I think those drivers will continue. And as we move into next year and we start to move into some of our offerings to support additional EUV activities, we should see some contribution from there as well. But reticle inspection was a driver. But to your point, it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter.\nQuinn Bolton: Follow-up question, just ASML, in call you talked about some modulation in its EUV system deliveries given no transition timing of some of its customers. Wondering if you look into next year, do you see continued growth in EUV print check, or do you expect that to perhaps soften for some period of time?\nRick Wallace: I wouldn't say softened. I mean the challenge that customers have with EUV print check is into new application, there are new algorithms. There\u2019s new defects that they've got to run down and do source. And so there's a huge appetite to get that. In fact, we're getting a lot of pressure to get systems that were forecast delivered to support that. And there are additional algorithms, as I said, we're developing. So all the indications we see are an expanding opportunity for EUV print check and I think that will go for some time based on the early indications that we're getting.\nOperator: We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: I wanted to dig into the gross margins and your operating margins, both were above your longer-term planned for September. And I believe the midpoint of your guidance says that they can sustain at these levels. I'm curious, how should we think about the trajectory of these margins going into the next several quarters? Can they sustain at these levels or do you think that there was anything abnormal, whether it was COVID or mix related that helped you? And as kind of part B of that, it was good to see you restart the share buybacks, but the levels are still somewhat below, I think what you have done in some prior quarter. So any color around just the sustainability of margins and how you can reaccelerate share repurchase would be very helpful. Thank you.\nBren Higgins: On gross margin, as I said earlier, we've been very pleased overall with the product positioning overall and the pricing related to that positioning. So that's been a good thing for our business. I mentioned operating leverage in Service. And so with the growth of the Service business, the utilization rates in the installed base that one thing with consolidation in the industry allows you to really drive good utilization across your resources. And we've invested in a lot of infrastructure over the last few years and we're starting to see the benefits of that now. We are getting the tailwind too in our EPC group related to acquisitions that the acquired businesses are doing better from a margin point of view. So there's a number of factors that are driving. If you look at our long term plan, we talked about 60% to 61% at these revenue level type gross margin performance. And I would expect us now to be somewhere between 61% and 62%. You do have mix factors in any given quarter. But I do think there's probably a good point here of sustainability versus the model that we had. If you take it down to operating margins, I think we're underspending our normalized spend levels just because of some of the COVID constraints around travel, but also how quickly we can hire people and so on. So I do think that the spend level is probably understated a bit when compare it to what normalized would look like. But I do think that there is a point here that drops through that has sustainability to it. Mix issues notwithstanding in any given quarter. On the buyback, as we back up and just look at it, we start with a principle in terms of how we look at the overall capital structure of the company and then how we allocate the capital. And so we start with a cash target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're operating within our target range today. And so most of our buybacks or returns generally are funded through ongoing cash flow. So it was a little bit lower in this quarter compared to the March quarter, I guess. I can't recall exactly where that number was, I think March and December. But I think as you look at that and we look at our go-forward expectations around cash flow, we would expect it will be roughly around these levels on an ongoing basis. So somewhere, it was $188 million, I'd say somewhere around $200 million plus or minus. And it's a systematic approach because, again, it starts with sort of a process that we run through. So we have some opportunistic possibility around that, that we can work around it. But at the same time, it tends to be much more principle based than anything else. So I think that's how you'll see it play out. At the end of the day, we're going to return at least 70%. We returned 82% in the last 12 months. And we're going to return at least 70% of the cash flow we're going to generate through the share repurchases and dividends and pretty balanced across the two.\nOperator:\n[:\nBlayne Curtis: I just want to revisit prior question on memory. You mentioned in your letter, customers were looking for higher big growth to meet demand. Just any more color where that demand is coming from? And I know you don't want to guide for memory next year, but just any color on what type of magnitude outside you're seeing?\nRick Wallace: Well, like I said, we're optimistic. We see some improvement in the December quarter, and I think that continues as we move into next year. So most of it coming from customers supporting 5G and handsets, we think that's probably the biggest driver. But it's pretty modest growth at these levels just given where the industry has been, but we're optimistic that we'll see growth as we move into next year.\nOperator: And I'm showing that we have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Kevin Kessel for any closing or additional remarks.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you very much, Priscilla, and thank you, everybody, for your questions and your interest. We will be talking to you shortly during the quarter during our virtual investor event. This concludes the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's KLA first quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As we rapidly approach the end of the calendar year, it's amazing when I stopped to think how much has changed over the last 12 months. I hope you and your families are safe and in good health and I appreciate your continued interest in and support for our company. I want to make sure I begin my remarks today by conveying my appreciation to the worldwide KLA team. It's your perseverance, strive to be better and determination that exemplify KLA's core values and enable us once again to meet our commitments and to deliver exceptionally strong financial performance in the September quarter. On behalf of the entire KLA executive team, I want to thank you. In this quarter's Shareholder Letter that was published today, we highlighted how our results demonstrate the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As many of you may have already seen, our September quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS both finished at the upper end of our guidance, a result of continued strong demand from customers, exceptional execution by our global teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model in guiding our strategic objectives. I'm pleased to say that, we are continuing this momentum into the December quarter and nearing the end of what truly has been an unprecedented year in calendar 2020. Most importantly, we are executing at a high level, operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and are solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. In terms of the resourcefulness of our global workforce, we just completed the third quarter of operating through a pandemic. COVID-19 has presented an unexpected opportunity to showcase KLA's resilience and resourcefulness in these unprecedented times. We have begun proactively taking steps to mitigate disruption in our business and remain vigilant of the risk posed by the virus to our people. We've done this by adopting strict safety protocols to protect our workforce, while innovating new ways to collaborate with customers and partners. As demonstrated by our strong performance throughout 2020, we are successfully meeting customer needs, executing our R&D roadmap and operating our worldwide manufacturing facilities efficiently. We continue to evaluate and adapt at various facilities in accordance with local regulation, prioritizing employee health and safety. Our worldwide teams deserve praise for never losing sight of what our customers want and need to improve their businesses, and to drive better yield management. We benefited from them being exceptionally resourceful and as always remain committed to customer satisfaction and meeting our commitments. While we consider the challenges our worldwide teams are facing today, we recognize that they extend well beyond the workplace, which makes us intently focused on ensuring that we're supporting our teams and our people in every possible way. Lastly, investment in long term remains an important priority for us. We're confident that our R&D programs will help strengthen our technology and market leadership. And we're gratified by the effectiveness of our business continuity actions, which have allowed R&D activities to adapt, although ,not without challenges, and to continue through this pandemic. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. In the September quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control revenue was solidly above plan and our services business delivered strong operating leverage and is on track to deliver double digit growth in 2020. We also ended the quarter with strong backlog, reflecting the enabling role KLA plays in our customers' technology roadmap and investment. Driven by the circular industry trends and the ongoing commitment by our customers to invest in R&D for next generation technology, the stage is set for KLA's outdoor market in calendar 2020. Today's environment continues to accelerate the adoption of several industry growth drivers that we originally outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. The integration of digital technology into our lives is transforming the way we live and work, resulting in fundamentally change to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This digital transformation is fueling secular demand drivers, such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and accelerated migration to the cloud from on-prem applications, as well as 5G communication, driving investments and innovation in advanced memory and logic device technologies. Process control is on the critical path of enabling this digital transformation, driving our growth and long term revenue and profitability. And the addition of the Orbotech in 2019 to our business portfolio has expanded our exposure to the compelling industry trends. We're all driving this all important digital transformation in our own business as well, including adopting new productivity tools to improve collaboration with our global teams and customers. For example, our customer service organization has been working closely with customers to expand remote service technologies, which augment our in country service and installation engineers. We've also recently adopted and integrated a new cloud based platform for managing our global HR management system that should continue to benefit us as we scale. Finally, we're also integrating cloud based manufacturing and service planning tools to increase the visibility of our parts demand to our suppliers and to allow us to more proactively respond to customer service requirements. Here's just a few examples of the accelerated digital transformation that we ourselves are experiencing inside of KLA as we adapt to this new environment. Here are five top highlights from our most recent quarter. First, as expected, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry and logic demand in the September quarter. These customers are benefiting from investment in digital transformation to support the secular growth drivers that we mentioned earlier. And we expect this demand to remain healthy in 2021. In memory, total utilization is high and memory customers continue to drive down device inventories and plan for higher bit growth in 2021 to meet expected improvement and then demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader range of customers in December quarter with momentum continuing into 2021. Second, we ended the quarter with strong backlog, demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups, fueled by new applications in our optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen5 and the success of our new offerings, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform, we're seeing strong adoption of our patterned wafer inspection product suite, driving our market leadership and what we expect will be a year of growth for process control. Third, our service business continues to perform well and is positioned for double digit growth in 2020. KLA's service revenue is 25% of the total quarterly and is delivering long term growth at a rate that's double the underlying industry WFE growth rate. Fourth, it was another strong quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components group, or EPC, highlighted by the record demand of our PCB division. The strong growth in PCB was driven by EPC's high exposure to the 5G infrastructure and smartphone market. SPTS and ICOS divisions are also benefiting from the transition to 5G along with increasingly the more complex advanced semiconductor packaging. Finally, in keeping with our commitments to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, we announced back in July that our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase. During the September quarter, we returned $329 million to investors via dividends and buybacks. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Bren to get into greater detail on our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges in the year associated with the pandemic, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of our global workforce. We have adapted well and we're very well positioned for a strong finish to 2020. This demonstrates the critical nature of our products and services in enabling the digital transformations of our lives, the resiliency of our business model and return value to our shareholders. We believe the secular factors driving our industry demand that we identified at last year's Investor Day are as relevant now as they were then, and they'll help us enable us to achieve our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long term operating leverage should yield consistent returns for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren. As you might imagine, these programs are at different points in their life cycle. So yes, we have seen contribution. For example, we talked about print check for EUV with the BBP platform, and that's been a continuation and a broadening of that demand. In other cases, we've talked recently about where we are in terms of the X-ray metrology product or the multi-beam reticle tool. Those are not contributing in a material way to the revenue in the near term, but those are products that we do expect to fuel our growth in '21 and beyond in support of the 2023 plan. In terms of how many programs we have under development, we have a number as always of significant investments going on. But as you might imagine, there are various phases of introduction. But when we laid out our 2023 plan, we're pretty confident that the programs that we've got in place and the ones that are under development are where they need to be in order to support the 2023 plan. The challenges of some of those, as you might imagine, there have been some COVID challenges, which maybe hit us harder early in COVID. And then we -- in terms of program execution. But we feel like we've made great progress in terms of navigating that. And we feel good about where we are, which is why we say we're on track to meet or exceed the '23 plans that we laid on. Bren, do you want to add to that? As we said in the prepared remarks, we had very strong backlog coming into the quarter. We had a positive book to bill this quarter. And if we look at the funnel of expectations into the December quarter, just the overall order outlook as we look into December and into March and then the backlog position we believe will take into the year, gives us some confidence of sustainability of these business levels. And so while it's early for us to spend a lot of time sizing '21, and we'll have more to say about \u201821 in the next earnings call in January, that overall position gives us confidence that we'll see some sustainability here. From a foundry/logic point of view when you look at the overall market, and there are puts and takes there. But we are pretty confident in the fact that foundry/logic looks like that it has sustainability as we move into the first half of the year, I don't see it changing. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter there's always fluctuation. But in general feel very good about the profile of that business as we move in the first half. It's a great question. And the answer is, we're relatively new to this business. So about year and half year, very impressed with what the Orbotech team had been doing. And I think in conjunction with them, we're really working hard to make sure we have the right amount of investment to continue new products meeting customer needs. And I would say that they had great engagement and we've added that. And as a result, we're investing heavily in that business to make sure that we're meeting some of the emerging demand, the flex PCB and all the new substrates, all the things. This is the beginning, as you know, of the 5G. And we think there's a continued opportunity for system growth over time. So we're very bullish on what that team has done. And in combination, we think it's been a tremendous success so far and a lot of upside as we go forward. But like KLA businesses, it requires continued investment in new capabilities and we're doing that right now. I think it's a good question. What we've seen so far, as you know, we're relatively conservative, but we have had indications and we believe earlier in EUV that we would see increased penetration of our advanced optical tools as well as in the mass shop. That's really playing out. So we do model process control intensity going up as a result of increased EUV adoption. And part of why that's working for us is, I mentioned EUV print check. That's essentially kind of a new category where we're able to deploy additional BBP tools to support the RAM of EUV. And as you might imagine, those wafers are incredibly expensive. So there's a a real focus by our customers to make sure that they're obviously optimizing their yield and catching excursions. At the same time, the size of the defect is becoming more relevant and smaller defects. So our tools end up having to run in modes where they capture smaller defects with increased algorithms, which also means that the capacity needs increase as the design rules go down in order to cover and detect. So yes, I would say that those are both tailwinds and our customers tell us that because they're very ambitious about ramping the advanced nodes and wanting to make sure we're in a position to support them. Does that answer your question? I wouldn't say softened. I mean the challenge that customers have with EUV print check is into new application, there are new algorithms. There's new defects that they've got to run down and do source. And so there's a huge appetite to get that. In fact, we're getting a lot of pressure to get systems that were forecast delivered to support that. And there are additional algorithms, as I said, we're developing. So all the indications we see are an expanding opportunity for EUV print check and I think that will go for some time based on the early indications that we're getting. Well, like I said, we're optimistic. We see some improvement in the December quarter, and I think that continues as we move into next year. So most of it coming from customers supporting 5G and handsets, we think that's probably the biggest driver. But it's pretty modest growth at these levels just given where the industry has been, but we're optimistic that we'll see growth as we move into next year."

            "content": "Thanks Rick and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's September quarter results once again demonstrated both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to exhibit our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining robust capital return strategy. Total revenue was $1.54 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03 at the high end of the guided range of $2.42 to $3.06. GAAP EPS was $2.69. Gross margin at 62.1% was 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, as higher semiconductor process control product mix, lower inventory reserve requirements due to strengthening demand and services leveraged, drove the upside realized in the quarter. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.27 billion. In terms of approximate customer segment mix of process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers, foundry was strong as expected at 59%, logic was 10% and memory was 31% in the September quarter. Within memory, the business was split roughly two thirds DRAM and one third NAND. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $89 million, down 11% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. Demand in this segment is driven by growth in RF, MEMs and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $181 million, down 10% sequentially but up 1% year-over-year. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.04 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.45 billion after retiring $50 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $456 million in the September quarter, free cash flow conversion was 96.1% and free cash flow margin was 29.7%. For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow, including $542 million in dividends paid and $789 million in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we repurchased $188 million of common stock and paid $141 million in dividends. As it relates to guidance, our view for WFE growth this year is approximately 10%, growing off a baseline of $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019. Given this and our outlook for revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter, KLA is in position once again to outgrow our industry. Looking forward, no early based on our current backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the first half of calendar '21. We will have more to say about our views of '21 WFE in our January earnings report. Before turning to our specific December quarter guidance, we'd like to comment on the current trade situation regarding United States and China. As you all know, in the September quarter, the US Department of Commerce stated that SMIC, or SMIC, may pose an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end-use in China. So we must obtain an export license prior to shipping certain systems and spare parts to SMIC and certain related parties that are subject to the US export administration regulations. This new license requirement did not have any effect on any shipments in the September quarter. We are complying with the new rules and have already applied for licenses for expected shipments in the December quarter. Given the expected level of business in the quarter subject to license requirements, the result of the license requirements will not have a material impact on revenue. And as a result, we have made no adjustments for this situation to our plans or guidance ranges. The trade situation remains fluid and we've done our best to give you our perspective on the impact to our business and we'll refrain from speculating on the situation further. Our December quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.585 billion plus or minus $75 million; Foundry is forecasted to be about 52% of semiconductor process control systems revenues for semiconductor customers, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst the foundry customer base; Memory is expected to grow to be approximately 37%: Logic is expected to be about 11%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as we expect similar product mix and services leverage as in the September quarter. The market reception to product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong. And as outlined at our Investor Day last year, the company has made solid progress in our plans at driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. In addition, better than modeled gross margin improvement in acquired businesses is a tailwind to our gross margins overall. Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest in other expenses of approximately $42 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.59 to $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.82 to $3.46, or $3.14 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, KLA is executing well with increasing confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and profitability. Growth in semiconductor revenue looks compelling over the long run with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fill our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? So on the SMIC situation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've applied for licenses for the December quarter where we think we need them. And if you look at just overall, I mean, SMIC, just for some background, it's an important customer but not a particularly large one. And over the last six months or so we've been discussing a broadening of investment. And certainly, they participated in that. There's probably timing factors that are involved in terms of how others are seeing this business come in over the course over the year. But as we look at what we revenued in the September quarter and where there was no effect and then we look at the December quarter, we've applied for licenses, as I said, where we need them. And at the end of the day, when we look at the overall expectation of revenue on our business for the quarter, we just don't see it having a material impact. So we didn't have to adjust anything, frankly. So our plans are consistent overall. So there's no change there. On your second question really difficult in our business. I mean, certainly, demand overall has been very strong. And so when you have a customer try to pull in a delivery, it means that they're taking a slot from another customer. And given the overall demand profile, that is -- most of the customers are sticking with their slots. So we haven't really seen a change. We've been, I think, fairly consistent in our view of shipments for the year of about $800 million. It's been second half loaded. It's what we are seeing today. So I haven't seen much of a change overall in terms of the behavior for customers, at least in regards to our products. Harlan, I think one of the things that we're pretty excited about is that over the last year or so, we've introduced platforms in a lot of our core businesses. And those platforms have had really strong market perception. We think you mentioned Gen 5, but also new iterations of the Gen 4 product line and customers mix and matching across both tool sets and supporting a wide variety of designs and different process flows, which has been great for the business. But new laser scattering offerings, you mentioned e-beam, we have a new e-beam inspection product. And the portfolio strategy of the company, as we connect those tools and we leverage common interfaces and common algos, common software, it's been able to, I think, provide a pretty competitive offering out there in the marketplace. And so we've been able to maintain our share. We grew share in 2019. We think we're going to maintain that in '20, maybe improve it a little bit and been able to do it at very strong margins. So certainly, growth in the overall business is a factor there but also the product position is a factor. So we're pretty pleased with what's out in the marketplace. And to Rick's point, we've got some new things coming down the pipe that hopefully will drive our performance against our '23 targets. And just one thing to add, C.J. I think one of the beliefs and our investment thesis on some of our new capabilities, for example, EUV print check, was that we were going to be highly relevant in the advanced nodes. But of course, people really hadn't hit much volume. So we've really seen proof of that concept. And we're getting a lot of customer pull for capacity and capability to support those ramps, and it's not just at one customer. So we feel very good about the process control intensity expectations that we had going into these nodes. We're seeing them being realized. So we view that as another positive indicator, not just on the overall foundry spend but on the process control related spend. Really, since the middle of 2018 or so, we've seen very disciplined spending by our memory customers. And so we've seen that continue through after a strong down year in 2019 to a flattish year here in 2020. We see some modest recovery here in the December quarter as you see from the disclosures we gave for the quarter. And we see that continuing as we move into next year. I don't see -- just if you look at the overall pricing environment and certainly the smartphone and timing of data center recovery, we'll have an impact on the overall memory environment. You've got EUV introduction into DRAM, which could be a factor as well as we move into the second half of the year that we would expect to see memory as an improving business for us as we move into '21. As I said, I think that the discipline has been there. And as we start to see pricing recover, I think you'll see more investment there. But I wouldn't say it's a huge expectation in terms of growth but I think a lot of it will be dependent on some of the end market dynamics that I mentioned. From a process control intensity point of view, it's a little bit higher today in 3D flash than DRAM, although the introduction of EUV and DRAM is an opportunity for us to drive process control intensity. So I think we're optimistic about that when we start to see that play out. And then also as stacks, layer counts increase in flash that we will see more opportunities for our metrology product lines. We've got some new product offerings. We also have the e-beam inspection tools. We talked about where things that we believe will ultimately create some opportunities for us for either intensity improvement or share. So I think we're pretty optimistic about those opportunities. In the September quarter, the change or the notification from the government came in at the very end of September. So there's no impact in the September quarter. And so as we look at the December quarter, as I said earlier, when we have to apply for licenses, we've applied for those. And we don't think that the granting of those licenses within the time frame we're talking about or not, will have a material impact on the business. Well, the licensing requirement is -- there isn't a licensing requirement that comes from a factor. A few questions in there, Tim, and I'll try to answer this for you. Yes, I mean your conclusion around December sequential Semi Systems is right, mid single digits. Obviously, we run the business at a total company level. But in terms of our expectations, it looks like it's sequentially a bit single digit growth here. And so when you take in aggregate, you add all that up that with our semi systems, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15% growth year-over-year against a market environment that's 10%. So that's an outperform. And if you look at last year, WFE was down about 7% and our Semi business was up 1%. So that's an outperform too in 2019. So we can spend some time with you on the math on all of this, but that's how to think about your questions. Patterning overall, we had a strong quarter in reticle inspection. So quarter to quarter, that was the biggest driver. Well, it's big ASPs. And so it's low integers and big ASPs. And so depending on timing, it does tend to be lumpy. Overall reticle inspection, because of the number of design starts in advanced foundry has been a really strong business for us. So I think that when we look at it overall, it was a very strong year in '19 and '20. It's down a little bit from '19 in that business but still pretty strong. So I think those drivers will continue. And as we move into next year and we start to move into some of our offerings to support additional EUV activities, we should see some contribution from there as well. But reticle inspection was a driver. But to your point, it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. On gross margin, as I said earlier, we've been very pleased overall with the product positioning overall and the pricing related to that positioning. So that's been a good thing for our business. I mentioned operating leverage in Service. And so with the growth of the Service business, the utilization rates in the installed base that one thing with consolidation in the industry allows you to really drive good utilization across your resources. And we've invested in a lot of infrastructure over the last few years and we're starting to see the benefits of that now. We are getting the tailwind too in our EPC group related to acquisitions that the acquired businesses are doing better from a margin point of view. So there's a number of factors that are driving. If you look at our long term plan, we talked about 60% to 61% at these revenue level type gross margin performance. And I would expect us now to be somewhere between 61% and 62%. You do have mix factors in any given quarter. But I do think there's probably a good point here of sustainability versus the model that we had. If you take it down to operating margins, I think we're underspending our normalized spend levels just because of some of the COVID constraints around travel, but also how quickly we can hire people and so on. So I do think that the spend level is probably understated a bit when compare it to what normalized would look like. But I do think that there is a point here that drops through that has sustainability to it. Mix issues notwithstanding in any given quarter. On the buyback, as we back up and just look at it, we start with a principle in terms of how we look at the overall capital structure of the company and then how we allocate the capital. And so we start with a cash target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're operating within our target range today. And so most of our buybacks or returns generally are funded through ongoing cash flow. So it was a little bit lower in this quarter compared to the March quarter, I guess. I can't recall exactly where that number was, I think March and December. But I think as you look at that and we look at our go-forward expectations around cash flow, we would expect it will be roughly around these levels on an ongoing basis. So somewhere, it was $188 million, I'd say somewhere around $200 million plus or minus. And it's a systematic approach because, again, it starts with sort of a process that we run through. So we have some opportunistic possibility around that, that we can work around it. But at the same time, it tends to be much more principle based than anything else. So I think that's how you'll see it play out. At the end of the day, we're going to return at least 70%. We returned 82% in the last 12 months. And we're going to return at least 70% of the cash flow we're going to generate through the share repurchases and dividends and pretty balanced across the two."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q4 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter.  \n Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references.  \n A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  \n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.  \n Our CEO, Rick Wallace will begin the call with some brief comments in our recent June quarter results before discussing our view of the semiconductor industry demand environment and then a few June quarter highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with some additional financial highlights from the quarter as well as our outlook and guidance.  \n I'd like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a few comments about the quarter. First, KLA continues to benefit from multiple growth drivers reflected in our June quarter results. Specifically for this quarter, our revenue of $2.5 billion was at the top end of our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.  \n GAAP EPS was $5.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.81, both at the top end of our guidance range. The talented global teams at KLA have remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and strategically navigating supply chain challenges. They are steadfast in their commitment to creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders.  \n Our teams continue to follow the KLA operating model as a guide to meet our challenges and benefit from the opportunities of an evolving market. Driving this performance, strong customer demand across major product groups, macroeconomic uncertainty and the resulting effects of consumer demand are areas we are monitoring closely.  \n Our customers have indicated some end markets, specifically PCs and mobile devices have softened over the past few months, and we have seen memory pricing in both segments weakened. While we have elevated concerns, we continue to see strong demand beyond our ability to supply from our customers with no material change in our shipment profile beyond the normal facility readiness issues and customers aligning tool deliveries with their production.  \n In assessing the full CY '22 WFE outlook, we have evaluated the persistent supply chain challenges and recently announced CapEx adjustment in the memory category. With this in mind, KLA's outlook for WFE growth in '22 has tempered. Bren will expand more on the details when he discusses the outlook.  \n We still see high single-digit WFE growth in calendar '22 and are confident in our ability to deliver relative WFE outperformance. We have supply chain challenges abate. This would be an additional upside. Process control is one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market. And as the market leader, KLA is in an inevitable position that fits the current demand landscape.  \n We see continued investment in technology at the leading edge and increased demand for legacy nodes. We also see growth in technology categories, including Advanced Packaging. These factors all support steady long-term growth for the WFE category.  \n We attribute KLA's consistent and strengthening market leadership to our focus on investing in innovation at a high level to drive differentiation through a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges.  \n Our technologies help our customers drive their growth strategy. I'd like to now briefly summarize a few quarterly highlights. First, KLA continues to drive strong relative outperformance versus peers. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investment across multiple nodes remain a tailwind. In memory, even with some customers' investment signaled to slow, demand diversification remains strong across multiple other industries.  \n Second, our Wafer Inspection business again delivered impressive results in the June quarter as revenues grew 20% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Third, KLA delivered record quarterly revenue from our Electronics, Packaging and Components business in the June quarter. Fourth, the KLA Services business surpassed the $0.5 billion quarterly revenue level for the first time as revenue was $512 million, up 15% year-over-year.  \n Finally, the June quarter was another exceptional period from the perspective of free cash flow and capital returns. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, amounting to 23% (sic) [ 82% ] year-over-year growth. We also announced a $6 billion share repurchase program and a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend level. Additionally, we increased our long-term targeted capital returns to 85% of free cash flow.  \n We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders versus -- via our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Also, this quarter, we introduced our new long-term revenue growth targets and financial model for 2026 at our June 16, 2022 Investor Day in New York City.  \n KLA's new 9% to 11% revenue growth objective through '26 features strong relative growth in each of our major business lines over that period. Our long-term model assumes a baseline semiconductor industry growth CAGR of 6% to 7% through 2026, with many forecasts today for the semiconductor market to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.  \n In summary, KLA's June quarter results once again demonstrate sustainable outperformance. Our consistent execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and in addressing persistent supply chain issues, highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.  \n Chief Financial Officer, Bren Higgins, will now go through our June quarter financial highlights and outlook. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. As Rick just said, KLA's June quarter results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. Revenue was near $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4% and non-GAAP diluted EPS and GAAP EPS were $5.81 and $5.40, respectively.  \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, below our expectation of $525 million, mostly due to the timing of new employees joining versus our plan. In addition, we also realized a cost benefit from the strong U.S. dollar impact resulting from our global footprint.  \n Total operating expenses comprised $297 million in R&D and $217 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect to continue our important investment in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the leverageable KLA operating model to facilitate growth.  \n Our investments include new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $530 million in the September quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to continue to trend higher over the balance of 2022 to support our sequential revenue growth expectations.  \n We will size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon.  \n Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 41.8%, almost 1 point higher than the guidance midpoint implied. Other income and expense, net, was $22 million, below guidance of $43 million, with the positive variance from guidance reflecting a gain on a strategic investment that was transacted in the quarter, offset by a recurring mark-to-market adjustment of a supply investment.  \n For the September quarter, we forecasted at approximately $75 million to reflect the impact of the new debt issuance. Quarterly effective tax rate was 14.8%, higher than the 13.5% guidance due principally to the equity market impact on deferred compensation programs. At the guided rate, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.09 higher at $5.90.  \n We continue to guide 13.5% as the long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $867 million. GAAP net income was $805 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million, and free cash flow was $746 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 86% and a free cash flow margin of 30%.  \n The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, where we saw a lot of activity this past quarter. KLA ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.\n In June, S&P upgraded KLA 1 notch to A-, citing improved scale and outlook for further profitable growth. Later in June, we issued $3 billion in new debt and announced the completion of a tender offer for $500 million of senior notes due 2024. These actions reinforce that KLA maintains active and diligent oversight of our cost of capital, an awareness of the impact on shareholder value of the appropriate capital structure for our business and productive capital allocation. \n As demonstrated by the new calendar 2026 financial targets and the capital return actions announced at our recent Investor Day, KLA has confidence in our business over the long term and is committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns that includes both dividend growth and increasing share repurchases. Consistent with this, we increased our long-term capital returns target as mentioned earlier. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.9 billion in share repurchases and $639 million in dividends paid. Turning to our outlook. We have adjusted our overall WFE outlook for calendar '22 to reflect persistent supply chain challenges that are [ gating ] shipments and revenue recognition for many of our peers. \n We now expect the WFE market to grow in the high single digits to approximately $95 billion in 2022, off a baseline of roughly $87 billion in calendar 2021. This outlook reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across customer segments. While we work hard to manage capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand. \n While our supplier engagement strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day has been validated through this cycle, supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. As indicated in the last couple of quarters, we continue to expect sequential growth through this calendar year and expect KLA's total revenue growth to meet or exceed the low 20% range, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. \n Finally, we expect demand to continue exceeding supply during the calendar year's second half. KLA is in a position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our Semi PC business, which should translate to strong relative growth overall. \n Looking ahead, as indicated earlier, we're concerned with the macroeconomic environment and how it may affect the demand for our customers' products and their capacity plans as we move into calendar 2023. To date, the pressure from customers to deliver remains high and is driving our expectations for sequential growth through calendar 2022. \n We're encouraged by the diversification and sustainability of our current demand profile and the company's operational execution. We are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support our customers' growing process control requirements, our near-term outlook and our long-term through-cycle growth thesis. \n Our September quarter guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 64%, and memory is expected to be around 36% of Semi PC systems revenue. In memory, DRAM is expected to be about 40% of the segment mix and NAND, 60%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 62% to 64%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.28 to $6.38 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.70 to $6.80. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 143 million shares. \n In conclusion, despite the macro and supply chain headwinds, we see the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE as both durable and compelling over the long run. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends in our industry. \n These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and the resumption of scaling reflects the value that semiconductors and our industry have in lowering our cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n When it comes to KLA, considering our track record of execution and the power of our portfolio, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable outperformance throughout changing economic periods. As we look at the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, we continue to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook and maintain our product development investments to enable industry growth and support our customers' multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. \n These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, position us to continue outperforming our industry as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive [ moat ], industry-leading financial performance, long-standing track record of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. \n That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. We are ready to queue for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid results and quarterly execution. You guys lead times are quite long, where you guys have good visibility into next year. And I think even into, in some cases, 2024, you highlighted some of the demand headwinds in your prepared remarks and also maybe some of the early signals from your customers on there's sort of conservative CapEx spending plans going forward. \n I know you're not seeing anything meaningful in terms of near to midterm shipment plans, but given your customers are all booking into next year, have you guys seen any changes in longer-term orders as a result of your customers' increasingly negative views on demand for next year? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Harlan, thanks for the comments and the question. I would say that certainly in the near term, we've seen no changes from our customers. In fact, the pressure is as high today as it was 3 months ago. And our adjustments to the near-term WFE were really related to some of the challenges that a lot of our peer companies are facing in terms of their ability to either ship tools or recognize revenue, and that would have an impact on WFE given the expectations for the second half -- in terms of growth in the second half versus the first half. \n It's too early for us to call '23. Certainly, we're monitoring what we see there. As we think about our planning and as we move into -- as we move outside of this year from -- at least from where we sit today, we see a sustainability in our output levels as we move into the first part of '23. \n Now we'll have to watch and see what our customers end up doing and particularly some of the challenges in the memory space and what that might mean. But at least from where we sit today, we see no real churn in the backlog and in expectations in terms of delivery timing. \nBren Higgins: Yes, even to add to that, Harlan, one of the things we have seen because obviously, we've been talking with customers recently and they're -- they know we're aware of some of the talk is that they're telling us basically 2 things. One, keep our slots. And two, if somebody else's spot opens up, could you please give it to us. So what we're seeing for process control feel like we're probably a little bit in a different position than the process players are. \nHarlan Sur: Great. And in the event of WFE decline next year, you've got several positive buffers, right? And I feel like one of the biggest ones is that your Services business historically does not decline during downturn. So like if I look back over the past 20 years, I think there's only been 1 year that your Services business has been down. And then more near term, I think over the past 4 downturns, the KLA team has actually grown its Services business in all 4 of those downturns. \n So outside of the stable annuity-like subscription service contracts, and I know you guys talked about expansion on services opportunities on legacy nodes like -- what else has allowed the team to grow its Services business in periods where WFE spending is weak? And what's the historical track record on the EPC Services business during downturns? \nRichard Wallace: So kind of 2 questions you threw in the EPC, one at the end. Let me start with the process control one. Often what we've seen historically in downturn is customers still want to get productivity. And one of the ways they do that as they focus heavily on yield improvement and process stability. So we actually see utilization stay high on the services in order to keep the tools capable. And sometimes they'll actually deploy some of their limited budget toward upgrading the installed base. \n In terms of EPC, obviously, we've not really been through a cycle with that. So it's a little bit secondhand knowledge. But it depends on the segment that they're in, in terms of -- but as you know, as a percent of our overall business, that will not change the dynamic that we see overall for our Services business -- should we hit some headwinds going into next year. \nBren Higgins: The only other thing I'd add, Harlan, is that we're seeing investment across multiple nodes. And so from a leading edge point of view, certainly, the complexity of the tools that are going in to support those markets, the drivers of those markets particularly around data center and high-performance compute will drive our customers to -- given how they buy process control to want to keep these tools up and use them as they're trying to navigate through these technology transitions. \n And so that's an important aspect of the value that we add. So even if they're pulling back on some of the capacity investments they might be making, they're still investing in R&D and ramping facilities. And the wafer start goals within a particular time frame may just change. \n If you think about within memory or even within some of the trailing edge areas, those areas are areas where process control intensity tends to be a little bit lower. And so I think just in terms of how we see the investment play out, those are areas that we're less exposed [indiscernible] don't think that they would impact the business to the degree that they might impact other more capacity-centric players. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. \nRobert Mertens: This is Bob Mertens on for Krish. My first question was just around if you could provide any color on a potential impact to the business in terms of shipments to China, if there were any sort of restrictions what this might look like, whether [indiscernible] sub-14-nanometer shipments, just sort of how you're thinking about that? And then I have 1 follow-up. \nBren Higgins: Well, specific to that question. And of course, there was some -- I know some of our peers have gotten this question as well. But we did receive a notification from the U.S. government about new licensing requirements for China related to sub-14-nanometer development and production. \n Of course, we'll continue to engage with the government and have an active dialogue and we'll fully comply with all applicable laws in guidance here. I would say that given the lead time and timing unpredictability of new licenses, that this has no effect on our guidance for the upcoming quarter or our comments on the remainder of '22. \n And I would say, as I look at the funnel over the next 12 months, given where investment is happening and what we expect, we don't see any material impact to our business from this new requirement. So I don't want to speculate on what else could happen. But based on what we know today and what we've been asked, that's mostly what I have to say about the topic. \nRobert Mertens: Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick, have you provided in the past, the breakdown between domestic and international shipments to China? if I remember correctly, maybe you mentioned domestic customers were more skewed towards smaller foundry players. Is that a fair assumption? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. That's still true. The multinational activity in China is more mature. And so most of our business is in China, it tends to be native China as it relates to Semiconductor Process Control. So within Semiconductor Process Control systems, about 25% or so of our shipments are to China. \n And now overall, for the whole company [indiscernible] service and you include other parts of the company and EPC and so on, you end up closer to -- in this last quarter, it was 29%. Most -- so most of the business is there and most of it is across multiple projects. There's a lot of projects. They tend to be more foundry/logic. You also have investment in infrastructure related to reticle infrastructure and wafer infrastructure. And so there's investments that are happening there, and we have products that serve those parts of the market as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: I was wondering if you -- Bren, if you go through kind of the puts and takes on gross margin this quarter and how we should think about cost pass-through this quarter and what's embedded in the guidance? \nBren Higgins: Yes, it pretty much played out the way we expected. We had more EPC revenue quarter-to-quarter as we had a record quarter in EPC, and that was a little dilutive from a mix point of view. Certainly, the challenges related to supply chain and what that means in terms of factory efficiency is also a bit of a drag on our margins. But we had modeled that in for the most part. \n And I think the guidance midpoint was 62.5%, and we were at 62.4%. So pretty much as we had expected. As we look at the September quarter, most of the growth is coming from our -- in fact, all the growth and then a little bit because I would expect EPC to be down some quarter-on-quarter, it is coming from Semi PC, it's a richer mix. \n And so we'll see that go up about 50 basis points or so at the midpoint. We are seeing pressure from cost increase, both in terms of parts but also in terms of freight and logistics and I think that's taking away some of the -- what you would expect to see in terms of incremental leverage in an expanding revenue environment like we're in. So it's offsetting some of those benefits. But at the end of the day, we felt like we'd be operating somewhere around 63% through this year, and that's been the guidance I've been giving and we're, for the most part, in line with that. \nJoseph Quatrochi: That's very helpful. And then maybe I missed it, but what was the mix of DRAM versus NAND for this quarter? I know you did it for the September quarter guide. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. So 45% was memory, and the mix was 2/3 DRAM. \nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel. \nJ. Ho: Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe first off, in terms of leading edge versus trailing edge foundry/logic, obviously, I think a lot of your leading edge customers are still powering through with their investment plan. It's more the question of timing of when they can get tools. \n Can you characterize what you're seeing on the trailing edge given that there's a lot of noise around that. Have you seen any changes in that marketplace? Or are investment plans for that device marketplace still on track on a going-forward basis? \nRichard Wallace: Sure. And yes, you're right. The leading edge guys are continuing, and we don't expect -- in our conversations with them, we don't expect any change in that. In terms of the trailing edge, it's not really been a big part of our business. And as we look forward, we're still struggling with demand -- with supply for some of them. \n And so actually, the conversations we've been having have been more about them asking if they could accelerate deliveries than changing the profile. So given the conversations we've had and their desire to upgrade their facilities, it's not really a change in our profile. It may soften, but it hasn't yet. And in fact, if anything, a comment I made earlier, people are asking if [ slots ] open up, could they get access to them, and that's really been more of the conversation that we've been having because some of the products that they need, especially in the trailing edge, tend to be [ BBP ] kind of oriented products where we have tremendous demand. \nBren Higgins: And the other thing I would add is about 80% of the revenue tends to be leading edge. So where we are selling to the trailing edge do have customers that are strategically trying to in-source more, so they're making more investments and longer-term investments. \n And as specifications for end products are changing that could change process control requirements. But generally, if they're just expanding capacity to run parts that they've been running for a long time that are just inflecting as a result of the strong demand environment, you don't see real significant changes in process control intensity. They just add their process control equipment as they're expanding the wafer starts in a particular facility. So that drives the process control intensity that's fairly light. \n Now over time, I think what's happening in the end markets is creating some opportunities for us but it's less of an impact in terms of the financial or the revenue contribution from those customers to KLA. It's great revenue, and its profitable revenue given that we're selling older platforms or platforms that we've been able to extend into those markets. But the big driver for our business is much more around leading edge than what we're seeing in the trailing edge. \nJ. Ho: Great. That's really helpful. And Bren, maybe as a quick follow-up question for you. You guys have done a really good job of managing through the supply chain issue that the industry and the ecosystem has seen. The costs are obviously elevated, whether it's freight and logistics, the movement of components and things of that nature. \n How do you look at the cost environment over the next several quarters? Is this something that we're just going to have to assume at least through the rest of '22 and possibly into '23. \nBren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. And of course, everything is more expensive. And so we're seeing that flow through earlier than prior quarters, maybe the last quarter, the quarter before, I talked about this year, expecting to see 100 basis point kind of impact, 1 point or so from incremental cost increase. And if you add freight into it, it's probably a little bit higher than that. \n And so we are seeing that [ play ] through. Generally, when prices go up, they don't necessarily go down. And so we're not really planning on it. And we'll have to -- as I said at Investor Day, there's work for us to do in terms of how we think about [indiscernible] this overall. \n Our products, generally, we're a value sell and so we think about the returns our customers are getting from our products, and we try to share in the value of that return. And part of our new capability cadence in terms of how we offer that to the market, it's managing not only new capability from a competitive point of view is important to that, but also what it means to financial model in terms of an opportunity for us to reassess the cost situation in a particular tool and how cost of ownership plays out in terms of the improvements that we're offering and how we will share that. \n So we're being opportunistic where we can. Certainly, we're not benefiting from the revenue expansion from a scale point of view. And so we're not giving discounts related purely to volume to the extent that we have in the past. And so we're resetting some of that with our customers. But in general, I think it's much more about the value offering and how things -- kind of how things are priced over time. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. \nAtif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: I had a question on CHIPS Act, and I understand it's early. It looks like equipment companies might be able to get money to expand manufacturing of equipment in the U.S. with priority going first 2 companies that already manufactured in the U.S., and I understand you guys have manufacturing both the inside the U.S. and outside. And how would this change, if at all, your long-term manufacturing strategy? \nRichard Wallace: Thanks for the question. It doesn't really change our strategy. We're not going to make decisions based on that. We're going to make decisions as we always have, based on where it makes the most sense for us to build the products to support our customers where we can get the talent and where we can have the supply chains that we need. So it will not impact our decision making. \nBren Higgins: You also [indiscernible] that we're fairly asset-light. So to the extent that we're building or expanding our facilities anywhere, it's really about space more than anything and some equipment. So it isn't -- it's very [indiscernible] our customers in terms of significant billions of dollars investment in a production facility. \n So to Rick's point, it's much more about the operational motives that we have in terms of why we build, what we build, where. And incentives, whether they come in the form of grants, they come in the form of taxes or secondary. Obviously, we always optimize for wherever we are, but the primary motive is very operational for us. \nAtif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: Great. As my follow-up, Bren, 19 years ago, you were talking about EPC systems growing 20% for the year, and I understand June was a record quarter. Are you still looking at 20% growth for the EPC systems for the full year? And how are you -- what are you seeing in the mobile segment versus the auto segment of that end market? \nBren Higgins: Yes. That's a great question. Auto is -- continues to be strong, auto and power, but we have seen some pressure, particularly in the PCB part of the business, driven by the softness in the mobile market. \n I would expect EPC systems to be in the mid-teens in terms of growth this year, a little bit stronger in the second half versus the first half just as the whole company is a little bit stronger. But yes, it's mostly been -- we've seen strength and improvement in SPTS, or Specialty Semiconductor given its exposure to automotive and power, but we've seen some softness on the PCB side. So net-net, still nice growth, mid-teens growth, but not 20%. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our final question from Vedvati Shrotre of Jefferies. \nVedvati Shrotre: I just wanted to go back on something that was asked earlier. So you mentioned that your customers are sort of looking for slots in case any opens up. So can you help me understand how that works. So if you get a push out from your customer, does that mean that slot is sort of close and the customer has to go back in the line. Is that a right interpretation? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. So I think our customers have the same kind of question you do. It doesn't really work that way. I mean, what they really want to do is move up the priority list. But as we keep explaining to them, we have far more demand than we have supply. And while we're working hard to expand it. So it's just the question of can we get things done sooner? \n And that's really what they're asking is can you tell? But my point is that is for many customers, the way they're approaching this, they're hopeful that this will give them a chance to get some of the products that are pretty far out in delivery. That's kind of the way to think about it. It's not really exactly the same. We do have allocations for people, but there just aren't no free slots. \n So if somebody were to drop out of the queue, the next person would just move up in terms of is the way that would work. So it's not -- people aren't going to jump ahead in the line. \nVedvati Shrotre: Right. And so if I understand correctly, so if -- in case if there is a pushout and not a cancellation, does that necessarily open up a slot or a push out can be different from...? \nBren Higgins: So if somebody had a December slot right now, and they said, we don't need that until June. The next person in line in December would get that slot, and they would be fit in somewhere in June. And they're likely our customers that have slots in June that would love to have a slot in December. \n So given the lead times on some of our products. So that's the natural churn we see. And a lot of it is tied to sometimes facilities and facility readiness. It also can be tied to whether they receive certain tools from other customers as they're setting up -- or other suppliers as they're setting up their production lines. \n So you always see a little bit of movement like that. But to Rick's point, we're underserving the level of demand we have. And so customers are having to get in line a long way out in a lot of cases. And so the ability to satisfy that demand earlier would be an opportunity for a lot of our customers that they would certainly want to take advantage of given the strength of the demand that they have seen, but also their desire for these products and our constraints around them. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We know how busy of a day it is today in terms of earnings. So I appreciate your time and interest. With that, I will turn the call back over to Leo to close it. \nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a few comments about the quarter. First, KLA continues to benefit from multiple growth drivers reflected in our June quarter results. Specifically for this quarter, our revenue of $2.5 billion was at the top end of our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.  \n GAAP EPS was $5.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.81, both at the top end of our guidance range. The talented global teams at KLA have remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and strategically navigating supply chain challenges. They are steadfast in their commitment to creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders.  \n Our teams continue to follow the KLA operating model as a guide to meet our challenges and benefit from the opportunities of an evolving market. Driving this performance, strong customer demand across major product groups, macroeconomic uncertainty and the resulting effects of consumer demand are areas we are monitoring closely.  \n Our customers have indicated some end markets, specifically PCs and mobile devices have softened over the past few months, and we have seen memory pricing in both segments weakened. While we have elevated concerns, we continue to see strong demand beyond our ability to supply from our customers with no material change in our shipment profile beyond the normal facility readiness issues and customers aligning tool deliveries with their production.  \n In assessing the full CY '22 WFE outlook, we have evaluated the persistent supply chain challenges and recently announced CapEx adjustment in the memory category. With this in mind, KLA's outlook for WFE growth in '22 has tempered. Bren will expand more on the details when he discusses the outlook.  \n We still see high single-digit WFE growth in calendar '22 and are confident in our ability to deliver relative WFE outperformance. We have supply chain challenges abate. This would be an additional upside. Process control is one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market. And as the market leader, KLA is in an inevitable position that fits the current demand landscape.  \n We see continued investment in technology at the leading edge and increased demand for legacy nodes. We also see growth in technology categories, including Advanced Packaging. These factors all support steady long-term growth for the WFE category.  \n We attribute KLA's consistent and strengthening market leadership to our focus on investing in innovation at a high level to drive differentiation through a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges.  \n Our technologies help our customers drive their growth strategy. I'd like to now briefly summarize a few quarterly highlights. First, KLA continues to drive strong relative outperformance versus peers. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investment across multiple nodes remain a tailwind. In memory, even with some customers' investment signaled to slow, demand diversification remains strong across multiple other industries.  \n Second, our Wafer Inspection business again delivered impressive results in the June quarter as revenues grew 20% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Third, KLA delivered record quarterly revenue from our Electronics, Packaging and Components business in the June quarter. Fourth, the KLA Services business surpassed the $0.5 billion quarterly revenue level for the first time as revenue was $512 million, up 15% year-over-year.  \n Finally, the June quarter was another exceptional period from the perspective of free cash flow and capital returns. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, amounting to 23% (sic) [ 82% ] year-over-year growth. We also announced a $6 billion share repurchase program and a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend level. Additionally, we increased our long-term targeted capital returns to 85% of free cash flow.  \n We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders versus -- via our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Also, this quarter, we introduced our new long-term revenue growth targets and financial model for 2026 at our June 16, 2022 Investor Day in New York City.  \n KLA's new 9% to 11% revenue growth objective through '26 features strong relative growth in each of our major business lines over that period. Our long-term model assumes a baseline semiconductor industry growth CAGR of 6% to 7% through 2026, with many forecasts today for the semiconductor market to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.  \n In summary, KLA's June quarter results once again demonstrate sustainable outperformance. Our consistent execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and in addressing persistent supply chain issues, highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.  \n Chief Financial Officer, Bren Higgins, will now go through our June quarter financial highlights and outlook. Bren? Yes. Harlan, thanks for the comments and the question. I would say that certainly in the near term, we've seen no changes from our customers. In fact, the pressure is as high today as it was 3 months ago. And our adjustments to the near-term WFE were really related to some of the challenges that a lot of our peer companies are facing in terms of their ability to either ship tools or recognize revenue, and that would have an impact on WFE given the expectations for the second half -- in terms of growth in the second half versus the first half. \n It's too early for us to call '23. Certainly, we're monitoring what we see there. As we think about our planning and as we move into -- as we move outside of this year from -- at least from where we sit today, we see a sustainability in our output levels as we move into the first part of '23. \n Now we'll have to watch and see what our customers end up doing and particularly some of the challenges in the memory space and what that might mean. But at least from where we sit today, we see no real churn in the backlog and in expectations in terms of delivery timing. So kind of 2 questions you threw in the EPC, one at the end. Let me start with the process control one. Often what we've seen historically in downturn is customers still want to get productivity. And one of the ways they do that as they focus heavily on yield improvement and process stability. So we actually see utilization stay high on the services in order to keep the tools capable.

But it depends on the segment that they're in, in terms of -- but as you know, as a percent of our overall business, that will not change the dynamic that we see overall for our Services business -- should we hit some headwinds going into next year. Yes. That's still true. The multinational activity in China is more mature. And so most of our business is in China, it tends to be native China as it relates to Semiconductor Process Control. So within Semiconductor Process Control systems, about 25% or so of our shipments are to China. \n And now overall, for the whole company [indiscernible] service and you include other parts of the company and EPC and so on, you end up closer to -- in this last quarter, it was 29%. Most -- so most of the business is there and most of it is across multiple projects. There's a lot of projects. They tend to be more foundry/logic. You also have investment in infrastructure related to reticle infrastructure and wafer infrastructure. And so there's investments that are happening there, and we have products that serve those parts of the market as well. Yes. So 45% was memory, and the mix was 2/3 DRAM. Sure. And yes, you're right. The leading edge guys are continuing, and we don't expect -- in our conversations with them, we don't expect any change in that. In terms of the trailing edge, it's not really been a big part of our business.

We're going to make decisions as we always have, based on where it makes the most sense for us to build the products to support our customers where we can get the talent and where we can have the supply chains that we need. So it will not impact our decision making. Yes. So I think our customers have the same kind of question you do. It doesn't really work that way.

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. As Rick just said, KLA's June quarter results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. Revenue was near $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4% and non-GAAP diluted EPS and GAAP EPS were $5.81 and $5.40, respectively.  \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, below our expectation of $525 million, mostly due to the timing of new employees joining versus our plan. In addition, we also realized a cost benefit from the strong U.S. dollar impact resulting from our global footprint.  \n Total operating expenses comprised $297 million in R&D and $217 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect to continue our important investment in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the leverageable KLA operating model to facilitate growth.  \n Our investments include new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $530 million in the September quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to continue to trend higher over the balance of 2022 to support our sequential revenue growth expectations.  \n We will size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon.  \n Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 41.8%, almost 1 point higher than the guidance midpoint implied. Other income and expense, net, was $22 million, below guidance of $43 million, with the positive variance from guidance reflecting a gain on a strategic investment that was transacted in the quarter, offset by a recurring mark-to-market adjustment of a supply investment.  \n For the September quarter, we forecasted at approximately $75 million to reflect the impact of the new debt issuance. Quarterly effective tax rate was 14.8%, higher than the 13.5% guidance due principally to the equity market impact on deferred compensation programs. At the guided rate, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.09 higher at $5.90.  \n We continue to guide 13.5% as the long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $867 million. GAAP net income was $805 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million, and free cash flow was $746 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 86% and a free cash flow margin of 30%.  \n The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, where we saw a lot of activity this past quarter. KLA ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.\n In June, S&P upgraded KLA 1 notch to A-, citing improved scale and outlook for further profitable growth. Later in June, we issued $3 billion in new debt and announced the completion of a tender offer for $500 million of senior notes due 2024. These actions reinforce that KLA maintains active and diligent oversight of our cost of capital, an awareness of the impact on shareholder value of the appropriate capital structure for our business and productive capital allocation. \n As demonstrated by the new calendar 2026 financial targets and the capital return actions announced at our recent Investor Day, KLA has confidence in our business over the long term and is committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns that includes both dividend growth and increasing share repurchases. Consistent with this, we increased our long-term capital returns target as mentioned earlier. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.9 billion in share repurchases and $639 million in dividends paid. Turning to our outlook. We have adjusted our overall WFE outlook for calendar '22 to reflect persistent supply chain challenges that are [ gating ] shipments and revenue recognition for many of our peers. \n We now expect the WFE market to grow in the high single digits to approximately $95 billion in 2022, off a baseline of roughly $87 billion in calendar 2021. This outlook reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across customer segments. While we work hard to manage capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand. \n While our supplier engagement strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day has been validated through this cycle, supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. As indicated in the last couple of quarters, we continue to expect sequential growth through this calendar year and expect KLA's total revenue growth to meet or exceed the low 20% range, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. \n Finally, we expect demand to continue exceeding supply during the calendar year's second half. KLA is in a position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our Semi PC business, which should translate to strong relative growth overall. \n Looking ahead, as indicated earlier, we're concerned with the macroeconomic environment and how it may affect the demand for our customers' products and their capacity plans as we move into calendar 2023. To date, the pressure from customers to deliver remains high and is driving our expectations for sequential growth through calendar 2022. \n We're encouraged by the diversification and sustainability of our current demand profile and the company's operational execution. We are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support our customers' growing process control requirements, our near-term outlook and our long-term through-cycle growth thesis. \n Our September quarter guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 64%, and memory is expected to be around 36% of Semi PC systems revenue. In memory, DRAM is expected to be about 40% of the segment mix and NAND, 60%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 62% to 64%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.28 to $6.38 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.70 to $6.80. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 143 million shares. \n In conclusion, despite the macro and supply chain headwinds, we see the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE as both durable and compelling over the long run. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends in our industry. \n These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and the resumption of scaling reflects the value that semiconductors and our industry have in lowering our cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n When it comes to KLA, considering our track record of execution and the power of our portfolio, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable outperformance throughout changing economic periods. As we look at the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, we continue to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook and maintain our product development investments to enable industry growth and support our customers' multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. \n These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, position us to continue outperforming our industry as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive [ moat ], industry-leading financial performance, long-standing track record of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. \n That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Yes, even to add to that, Harlan, one of the things we have seen because obviously, we've been talking with customers recently and they're -- they know we're aware of some of the talk is that they're telling us basically 2 things. One, keep our slots. And two, if somebody else's spot opens up, could you please give it to us. So what we're seeing for process control feel like we're probably a little bit in a different position than the process players are. The only other thing I'd add, Harlan, is that we're seeing investment across multiple nodes. And so from a leading edge point of view, certainly, the complexity of the tools that are going in to support those markets, the drivers of those markets particularly around data center and high-performance compute will drive our customers to -- given how they buy process control to want to keep these tools up and use them as they're trying to navigate through these technology transitions. \n And so that's an important aspect of the value that we add. So even if they're pulling back on some of the capacity investments they might be making, they're still investing in R&D and ramping facilities. And the wafer start goals within a particular time frame may just change. \n If you think about within memory or even within some of the trailing edge areas, those areas are areas where process control intensity tends to be a little bit lower. And so I think just in terms of how we see the investment play out, those are areas that we're less exposed [indiscernible] don't think that they would impact the business to the degree that they might impact other more capacity-centric players. Well, specific to that question. And of course, there was some -- I know some of our peers have gotten this question as well. But we did receive a notification from the U.S. government about new licensing requirements for China related to sub-14-nanometer development and production. \n Of course, we'll continue to engage with the government and have an active dialogue and we'll fully comply with all applicable laws in guidance here. I would say that given the lead time and timing unpredictability of new licenses, that this has no effect on our guidance for the upcoming quarter or our comments on the remainder of '22. \n And I would say, as I look at the funnel over the next 12 months, given where investment is happening and what we expect, we don't see any material impact to our business from this new requirement. So I don't want to speculate on what else could happen. But based on what we know today and what we've been asked, that's mostly what I have to say about the topic. Yes, it pretty much played out the way we expected. We had more EPC revenue quarter-to-quarter as we had a record quarter in EPC, and that was a little dilutive from a mix point of view. Certainly, the challenges related to supply chain and what that means in terms of factory efficiency is also a bit of a drag on our margins. But we had modeled that in for the most part. \n And I think the guidance midpoint was 62.5%, and we were at 62.4%. So pretty much as we had expected. As we look at the September quarter, most of the growth is coming from our -- in fact, all the growth and then a little bit because I would expect EPC to be down some quarter-on-quarter, it is coming from Semi PC, it's a richer mix. \n And so we'll see that go up about 50 basis points or so at the midpoint. We are seeing pressure from cost increase, both in terms of parts but also in terms of freight and logistics and I think that's taking away some of the -- what you would expect to see in terms of incremental leverage in an expanding revenue environment like we're in. So it's offsetting some of those benefits. But at the end of the day, we felt like we'd be operating somewhere around 63% through this year, and that's been the guidance I've been giving and we're, for the most part, in line with that. And the other thing I would add is about 80% of the revenue tends to be leading edge. So where we are selling to the trailing edge do have customers that are strategically trying to in-source more, so they're making more investments and longer-term investments. \n And as specifications for end products are changing that could change process control requirements. But generally, if they're just expanding capacity to run parts that they've been running for a long time that are just inflecting as a result of the strong demand environment, you don't see real significant changes in process control intensity. They just add their process control equipment as they're expanding the wafer starts in a particular facility. So that drives the process control intensity that's fairly light. \n Now over time, I think what's happening in the end markets is creating some opportunities for us but it's less of an impact in terms of the financial or the revenue contribution from those customers to KLA. It's great revenue, and its profitable revenue given that we're selling older platforms or platforms that we've been able to extend into those markets. But the big driver for our business is much more around leading edge than what we're seeing in the trailing edge. Yes, it's a good question. And of course, everything is more expensive. And so we're seeing that flow through earlier than prior quarters, maybe the last quarter, the quarter before, I talked about this year, expecting to see 100 basis point kind of impact, 1 point or so from incremental cost increase. And if you add freight into it, it's probably a little bit higher than that. \n And so we are seeing that [ play ] through. Generally, when prices go up, they don't necessarily go down. And so we're not really planning on it. And we'll have to -- as I said at Investor Day, there's work for us to do in terms of how we think about [indiscernible] this overall. \n Our products, generally, we're a value sell and so we think about the returns our customers are getting from our products, and we try to share in the value of that return. And part of our new capability cadence in terms of how we offer that to the market, it's managing not only new capability from a competitive point of view is important to that, but also what it means to financial model in terms of an opportunity for us to reassess the cost situation in a particular tool and how cost of ownership plays out in terms of the improvements that we're offering and how we will share that. \n So we're being opportunistic where we can. Certainly, we're not benefiting from the revenue expansion from a scale point of view. And so we're not giving discounts related purely to volume to the extent that we have in the past. And so we're resetting some of that with our customers. But in general, I think it's much more about the value offering and how things -- kind of how things are priced over time. You also [indiscernible] that we're fairly asset-light. So to the extent that we're building or expanding our facilities anywhere, it's really about space more than anything and some equipment. So it isn't -- it's very [indiscernible] our customers in terms of significant billions of dollars investment in a production facility. \n So to Rick's point, it's much more about the operational motives that we have in terms of why we build, what we build, where. And incentives, whether they come in the form of grants, they come in the form of taxes or secondary. Obviously, we always optimize for wherever we are, but the primary motive is very operational for us. \nAtif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: Great. As my follow-up, Bren, 19 years ago, you were talking about EPC systems growing 20% for the year, and I understand June was a record quarter. Are you still looking at 20% growth for the EPC systems for the full year? And how are you -- what are you seeing in the mobile segment versus the auto segment of that end market? Yes. That's a great question. Auto is -- continues to be strong, auto and power, but we have seen some pressure, particularly in the PCB part of the business, driven by the softness in the mobile market. \n I would expect EPC systems to be in the mid-teens in terms of growth this year, a little bit stronger in the second half versus the first half just as the whole company is a little bit stronger. But yes, it's mostly been -- we've seen strength and improvement in SPTS, or Specialty Semiconductor given its exposure to automotive and power, but we've seen some softness on the PCB side. So net-net, still nice growth, mid-teens growth, but not 20%. So if somebody had a December slot right now, and they said, we don't need that until June. The next person in line in December would get that slot, and they would be fit in somewhere in June. And they're likely our customers that have slots in June that would love to have a slot in December. \n So given the lead times on some of our products. So that's the natural churn we see. And a lot of it is tied to sometimes facilities and facility readiness. It also can be tied to whether they receive certain tools from other customers as they're setting up -- or other suppliers as they're setting up their production lines. \n So you always see a little bit of movement like that. But to Rick's point, we're underserving the level of demand we have. And so customers are having to get in line a long way out in a lot of cases. And so the ability to satisfy that demand earlier would be an opportunity for a lot of our customers that they would certainly want to take advantage of given the strength of the demand that they have seen, but also their desire for these products and our constraints around them."

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n I'd like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin.\n Before getting into KLA's results in more detail, I want to acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. Their perseverance and drive to be better remains at the center of our consistent execution and outperformance. You have remained focused despite challenging macro and supply chain conditions as our high-performing teams that drove KLAs indispensability to customers, resulting in additional process control market share growth for the recently ended year. \n KLA's March quarter results demonstrate strong execution across multiple areas of our business in a persistently challenging supply chain environment, delivering revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance ranges for the quarter.  \n We once again displayed strong execution across multiple areas of our business. Our focus on consistently meeting commitments and delivering on our long-term strategic objectives and financial targets is the hallmark for which KLA is known and the standard by which we measure our success. \n Customer demand across major product groups continues to build as secular trends drive broad-based growth across a range of markets and applications served by the semiconductor industry. This robust demand has been putting pressure on the industry's ability to supply semiconductors.  \n Simultaneously, our leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to improve their competitive positioning while addressing growth in markets that demand new leading-edge semiconductor capabilities. Against this rising demand backdrop, KLA has remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and navigating supply chain challenges. \n Very important that KLA continues to operate with purpose and precision so we can create value for our customers, partners and shareholders by outperforming expectations. Our talented global teams both run and improve the KLA operating model and use it as a critical guide to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the evolving marketplace.  \n The market leader in process control, one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market, KLA remains in a position of strength when we look at the industry demand landscape. Semiconductor industry has evolved to be more significantly strategic and has an increasingly less cyclical end-market mix, with many fundamental drivers advancing the critical nature of semiconductors throughout the global economy.  \n Factors such as the continuing advancement of technology at the leading edge, increasing investment in legacy nodes, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging, are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor industry and for equipment and capabilities that make it possible.  \n Despite persistent supply challenges and macro headwinds, our outlook for the WFE industry this year remains intact, albeit with an expectation for a stronger second half than anticipated in January. We expect WFE demand to top $100 billion this calendar year, making it the third consecutive year of double-digit growth.  \n KLA's expected growth in calendar 2022 will mark the seventh consecutive year of growth. This sustained strength in customer demand is happening in an environment of increasing momentum for process control where KLA's market leadership has strengthened further, and our market share results remain 4x our nearest competitor.  \n KLA's expanding lead is the result of our #1 market position in some of the fastest-growing segments in WFE that have a market size greater than $1 billion in terms of annual revenue. We attribute KLA's strengthening market leadership to our ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategies, including investing at a high level to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges in the marketplace and help our customers drive their growth strategy.\n We're pleased to see the success of our strategies validated by our customers' purchasing decisions and reflected in the April 2022 Gartner market share report, showing KLA's market leadership advancement. This emphasizes the power of the portfolio strategy we employ. \n The recently published Gartner market share report shows process control was one of the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, growing 43% in the year to $10.4 billion. KLA's share of process control grew approximately 1 percentage point to over 54% and has increased over 3 percentage points since 2018 and remains greater than 4x our nearest competitor across all regions.\n Within process control, the optical inspection market grew to approximately $2.5 billion in annual sales, outpacing WFE by 40%, and our share of this market remained above 80%. Other highlights demonstrate the power of KLA's portfolio strategy in delivering strong growth in other critical process control markets, including metrology, macro inspection and very strong growth in e-beam review. \n Turning now to the top 5 highlights for the March 2022 quarter. First, KLA's market leadership in some of the most critical and fastest-growing markets in WFE continues to fuel growth. We remain nimble and innovative in addressing global supply challenges to meet customer requirements and our financial targets.\n Foundry and Logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity remain a tailwind. In memory, demand is broad-based across multiple customers.\n Second, our optical metrology business stood out in the March quarter, driven by KLA's market leadership and increasing customer adoption of market applications and leading-edge technology development and capacity monitoring. Optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and critical next-generation architectures, including gate-all-around and multi-stack 160-plus layer 3D NAND. This was further illustrated in the new Gartner market share report, which showed 50% growth in 2021.  \n Third, KLA is intensifying our efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolio of both the SPC and EPC groups. KLA is broadening our product portfolio and delivering a comprehensive suite of products and technologies that include wafer-level packaging and final assembly and test products for advanced packaging markets, and a portfolio of inspection systems and process tools designed to help customers achieve their 0 defect goals.  \n These collaborations continue to grow with KLA recording our highest-ever customer engagement in terms of wafer inspection revenue for automotive applications in the March quarter.  \n Fourth, services revenue was $488 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company tallied a record 349 installs in the March quarter, well above the previous high of 293. This was a remarkable achievement given travel restrictions in Asia, lockdowns related to COVID-19 and complexities related to the supply -- current supply environment.  \n Service revenue is consistently outperforming the 9% to 11% long-term growth target, driven by growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, higher utilization rates, and expansion of service opportunities in the legacy nodes.  \n Finally, the March quarter was another exceptional period from a free cash flow perspective. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $719 million for 23% year-over-year growth. We've also remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase programs, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including a $565 million in quarterly share repurchases and an additional $159 million in dividends in the March quarter.  \n Before passing the call over to Bren to review the financial highlights and guidance, let me summarize briefly. KLA's March quarter demonstrates sustained outperformance, highlighting the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives. Our consistent strong execution against significant challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of meeting rising demand and addressing persistent supply issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.\n KLA is exceptionally positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we continue to see more customer interest driven by technology change than ever before at the leading edge.  \n Simultaneously, the need for increasing performance and reliability requirements for legacy nodes to support evolving markets like automotive and 5G are also important to help deliver new capabilities. We believe KLA will continue to benefit from numerous secular growth factors that drive long-term industry demand. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide durable free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren. \nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. \n Our results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. We continue to focus on meeting customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, increasing gross and operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.  \n Quarterly revenue was $2.289 billion at the upper end of the guided range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was above the midpoint of guidance at 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected semiconductor process control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter.  \n Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.13, also towards the upper end of the guided range of $4.35 to $5.25. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.83. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $484 million, below our expectation of $495 million, mostly due to the pace of new hiring, which was slower than originally planned. Total operating expenses were comprised of $285 million in R&D and $199 million in SG&A.  \n Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion of our business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model to facilitate growth. This includes investing in new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis.\n Furthermore, we, as most companies, are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and adjustments related to our annual merit process that went into effect during March. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow to approximately $525 million in the June quarter, and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to trend higher over the balance of 2022, along with our sequential revenue growth expectations. \n We continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over our normalized time horizon.\n Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was once again strong at 41.7% in the March quarter. Other income and expense net was $46 million compared with guidance of $41 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the mark-to-market impact of a strategic supply investment.\n For the June quarter, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $43 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.6%, above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share at the guided tax rate would have been $5.20. Non-GAAP net income was $776 million. GAAP net income was $731 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $719 million, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 93% and free cash flow margin of 31.4%.\n Looking at revenue by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.98 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as expected. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix for foundry logic customers was approximately 63%. Memory was approximately 37%, with a further breakdown comprised of 26% from DRAM customers and 11% from NAND.  \n Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in automotive, 5G and advanced packaging. Within EPC, the specialty semiconductor process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated revenue of $117 million, up 28% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $193 million, down 6% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. \n For an additional breakdown of revenue by major products in region, please see the shareholder letter and slides.  \n In terms of the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in total cash, debt of $3.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We have growing confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns to shareholders that enables growing dividends and increased share repurchases.  \n Over the long term, we target returning at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our capital return strategy underscores our strong record of predictable and productive capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $620 million in dividends paid. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and a strong free cash flow margin across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions.  \n Turning to the outlook. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook for calendar '22 remains unchanged. We expect the WFE market to grow in the mid-teens to over $100 billion in 2022, off a higher base of approximately $87 billion in calendar '21 after assessing reported results for the December quarter.  \n Although based on pure company March reporting, it appears that industry supply issues will increase the loading in the second half of the year. This reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across all customer segments. While we add capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.\n In addition, the duration and potential expansion of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are unknown and could adversely impact some suppliers with operations in the affected areas. Furthermore, these lockdowns could delay systems installations and customer acceptance processes due to resource mobility restrictions in the country. In short, the situation is fluid and will be monitored closely.\n Supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. We still expect to see quarterly sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2022 and overall revenue growth for the calendar year to exceed 20%. In addition, we believe that demand will continue to exceed supply through the remainder of the calendar year. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our semiconductor process control business and strong relative growth overall. \n Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile. Our bookings momentum and strong backlog positions us to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support this outlook and our customers' growing process control requirements.\n Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.425 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 56%, and memory is expected to be approximately 44% of semiconductor process control systems revenue.\n Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 66% of the segment and NAND is forecasted to be about 34%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as we expect sequential growth in EPC revenue in the quarter and a slightly weaker product mix within semi process control to dilute margins modestly versus the March quarter.\n Longer term, infrastructure investments, labor cost inflation, supply chain strain and rising global logistics costs are surpassing the benefits of economies of scale normally seen in a rising revenue environment. Given expectations for revenue for the year, we continue to expect that calendar '22 gross margins will be in a range of 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points.\n Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $525 million, other income and expense net of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $5.70. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.93 to $6.03. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 150 million shares.\n In closing, the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE are compelling despite the current macroeconomic headwinds. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. \n We have confidence in the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and bookings visibility, which motivates us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future.\n KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to shareholders.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. \n David, please queue for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Great job on the solid execution. \n As you guys pointed out, the market share numbers are out for last year. You grew your process control market share to almost 55% or well over 4x larger than your nearest competitor.\n I was looking at the data. So in the 7 major categories under process control, you have the #1 market share position in 5 of the 7 categories. And the categories where you guys actually grew 50% -- more than 50% were pattern wafer inspection, overlay and metrology, macro inspection and review and classification. \n Obviously, all of these are very critical solutions for next-generation manufacturing technologies. So on the strong growth outlook for this year, what areas or segments do you anticipate driving the outperformance and maybe even further share gains in your process control franchise for this year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Harlan, I'll go ahead and start and let Rick add if he needs to here. But it was a very strong year, obviously, for the company. And we're really pleased with the share results. \n One of the things as we look at just our expectation this year is we expect to see continued momentum in a lot of the markets that you referenced, so there's certainly strength that's expected there. We're expecting greater than market growth out of our reticle inspection business, which was a little slower than market last year, and it tends to be a lumpier business. But as we move into this year, it should be a little bit stronger.\n So overall, we feel pretty good about the road map across our products. As we said in the prepared remarks, our biggest challenge is just getting the parts we need to meet the very strong customer demand that's out there.\n But we're encouraged by the momentum we have, and our internal plan is to continue to gain share. We think there's more opportunity for us given what you said in terms of where we are. We go linearly, but at the same time, we've had a nice trajectory over the last few years and would expect to see it grow as we move forward. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just to add a couple of things, Harlan. One is, of course, Gartner's data is revenue and the bookings picture is even stronger. So we're in really good shape in terms of that.\n We've talked about the backlog and the demand that we have. So we'll continue to see share gain in terms of -- or strength of share in the segments that you outlined. Also, the new technologies that are coming offer more process control intensity opportunities.  \n For example, high-k/metal gate, if you look at that, if you look at gate-all-around, the metrology, bigger die size, all those things are going to allow -- there would be more opportunity. And we have products in the queue as well as in the field that are going to take advantage of that. So we feel very well positioned.  \n The biggest challenges we've talked about is satisfying demand, and that's related to -- we think we've done a really good job with supply chain, but there's more work to do there to continue to support our customers. \nHarlan Sur: I appreciate the insights there. And then on your EPC franchise, specialty semiconductor, manufacturing, packaging, PCB, display franchises. It's been a great diversification for the KLA business. And I know, going back -- and you guys will probably update us, but going back to the last Analyst Day, the team's outlook for EPC was to grow that business at a 9% to 10% CAGR. You grew that business -- and this includes services, you grew that business about 15% last year. The 2-year CAGR up to last year has been about 12%.\n So tracking ahead of your targets, what type of growth do you guys expect for EPC this calendar year, just given the strong focus by your semi customers on power, RF, sensors, advanced packaging and new PCB architectures? And maybe that's been slightly offset by smartphone and display weakness, but wanted to get your views on EPC growth for this year. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, Harlan. So in terms of the systems part of EPC, we're somewhere close to 20% is our expectation for the year. Obviously, we'll have to see how that plays out. That tends to be a little bit of a shorter lead time business and have some parts of its markets that are a little bit more sensitive to some of the consumer dynamics.\n But in general, we expect to see about a 20% growth there. Now if you blend it with its service business, it will be in the high teens. That service business tends to grow a little bit slower than that.  \n But you're right, over the last couple of years, on the systems side, we've been in that 20% range. And it hasn't gotten as much of a play as -- given the strength of our semi process control business. But we're pleased with where we're going directionally there. And we'll have more to say about the longer-term view at our Investor Day in mid-June. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, can you speak to your backlog? What your blended kind of lead times look like today? And what kind of visibility that provides you into 2023? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, C.J, it's a great question. Right now, blended lead times, and they're blended across right products and the revenue value of the composition of the backlog, but it's well over a year now in terms of where lead times are. Obviously, certain product lines are longer than that. We're slotting certain product lines now today out into 2024. So there's quite a bit of demand for some of the products.\n And given the constraints we have around key components and the lead time for those components, it just pushes that -- those lead times out. So overall, we've seen it trend up here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, as we go through the year, I continue to expect to see demand exceeding supply. So I would expect lead times to probably increase a little bit as we move over the course of the year. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up. Curious, on the China lockdowns, any impact or future impact in your view, particularly around kind of PCB and display area? I would imagine that might be a downstream potential risk in terms of taking deliveries. \nRichard Wallace: Well, our guidance implies a risk-adjusted assessment of where we're at. Obviously, there's always some unknowns about that, both from a supply point of view, which we feel pretty good about, but also more so from just can we get access to customers, can we get tools installed, can we get acceptances done and so on.\n We've contemplated that in the guidance we've given. We do have an expectation of seeing some opening begin in the, call it, sort of the middle of May. If things drift out further than that or there's a significant expansion of lockdown activity, it could have more of an impact. \n But we -- I think we've risk-adjusted it as best as we can. There's certainly some unknowns. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I wanted to try to probe a little bit on that question around backlog because backlog really doesn't mean a whole lot when your lead times are sitting beyond that 12-month window for backlog.\n So I guess the question is more on purchase obligations. I think you report that in the Q, and it was greater than $8 billion, I think, exiting December. And so I guess the first question is sort of where does that stand now? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of how long book-to-bill is going to stay above 1. And maybe if you could give us backlog, a number. \nBren Higgins: Yes. So Tim, you'll see the exact number in the 10-Q that we file. And it's the performance obligations, not purchase commitments. But anyway, the performance obligations, where you're right, we're over $8 billion last quarter and we'll be in excess of $10 billion this quarter. And to my earlier comment, I think we'll see book-to-bill above 1 through the year. \nTimothy Arcuri: I guess I had a question also on process control systems. So March came in like almost $100 million better than what I had and what I think your sort of guidance was implying. June is about in line. I think before, you were talking about the second half of the year, process control systems being up sort of low to mid-teens. And I guess the question within that is, is that still the right number even though March came in a bit better? And part of that is a question really on timing because the films guys, as you said, they're having problems shipping tools. And so that is tending to push some WFE from the first half into the back half. \n And I guess the question is, since you guys are sort of up-siding shipments and they're sort of down-siding shipments, does it become a problem for you, where you have like timing mismatches and maybe -- because they can't get film tools, maybe they start to push out your tools? \nBren Higgins: Tim, usually, that doesn't impact us all that much because we tend to see process control tools go in early. Also, given the demand environment, customers will deal with timing issues in terms of taking tools and storing them to align with expectations around their other tool sets.  \n So I'm less concerned about that given that the strength of demand. Customers are beating on us every day to ship sooner, so I'm not I'm not concerned about delays in other types of tools impacting our products.  \n And you're right, we did have -- Q1 was stronger. Certainly the execution by the teams in the last month as we dealt with a lot of delays in parts, particularly around automation for our systems, the execution was really solid. And we're really pleased with the upside we saw in Q1.\n So as I think about the second half, the second half, I'm still in the same range, low to mid-teens in terms of semiconductor process control systems. So half to half versus the first half. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: I was curious, how should we think about the -- you mentioned slower-than-planned or hiring in a difficult labor environment? I assume that's more maybe geared towards 2023. Or how do we think about that in terms of your ability to have enough labor to meet demand for this year? \nRichard Wallace: Joe, it's Rick. It wasn't really -- it was much more about the impact to cost about when they're hired. We actually did quite well of hiring in Q1. It's just if they're not hired at the beginning of the quarter and we factored in the payroll for the whole quarter, we're on track for our hiring this year. \n And most of that had to do, frankly, more with some of the engineering work than it does the work that's associated with both operations and service, where you could potentially, if you didn't have the resources, see a shortfall for the year.  \n But even then, it would just -- right now, we're trying to alleviate the teams who are doing a lot of overtime and trying to provide them some backfill. So none of our hiring challenges are affecting our ability to support the revenue for this year or next year. But we do want to get people in, and we've had good success, but it's more -- we're talking months as opposed to quarters or years behind. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about the strength you saw in DRAM during the quarter? And I think you even implied in the guide, I think we're at record levels for process control systems. Just kind of curious what drove that, if it's architectural changes, EUV? Anything like that would be helpful. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Joe, it's mostly technology transitions this year. And certainly, the introduction of EUV and DRAM has been a driver for investment from our customers. It's pretty broad. As I look at the DRAM investment, it's pretty broad-based across our customer set. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. \nJ. Ho: Maybe first off for you, Rick. In terms of the advanced packaging market, you've done a great job in terms of getting the value proposition for front-end chipmakers with your process control solutions.\n Now some of these customers are the same ones on the advanced packaging side. Some of them obviously are OSAT and customers like that. As advanced packaging becomes a much more complex problem, how do you get the customer mindset changed to get that same value proposition for those type of processes given the complexities that are occurring? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, good question, and one that -- obviously, we're excited about the EPC acquisition for exactly this. So I would say really, for EPC, even in earlier question we had about how we're doing and how we think about it, I really think of it in 3 stages. The first stage for EPC for KLA was to employ the operating model and how we run the businesses, and that was really what we did initially.  \n The second stage was customer engagement. And because, as you say, some of these customers are bigger customers, have more complex problems. And they know KLA, they wanted to engage with us. So that's actually been going quite well, and we've been having a lot of discussions.  \n But of course, then you get to the third part of that, which is technology leverage from the rest of KLA into EPC. And we're kind of in Phase 2 and Phase 3 now where we've been having those meetings. There are a lot of clear opportunities for us, and we're developing those solutions and rolling those out.\n So I think that you'll see the leverage, the revenue synergy associated from the additional channel access and the needs and then the benefit of our technology as we go forward. That's really -- that's coming. We're going to talk more about that at the Analyst Day in June as we roll that out. But right now, huge opportunities, and we feel like we're just at time with that acquisition to be in a position to support them. \nJ. Ho: Great. As my follow-up maybe for Bren. Given WFE, the outlook looks like it's going to be a much more second half-weighted year, particularly in terms of revenues and when the equipment companies receive cash.\n You guys have been executing well, getting tools out on time. But we've heard from other companies where they're \"shipping incomplete tools\", where they'll finish the install and get the revenue recognition later on, so to not expect a huge \"shipment ramp\" or a huge production ramp the second half of the year. \n How are you balancing those dynamics? Are you shipping any incomplete tools at the customer site where you can then go back later on so it doesn't overly imbalance both shipments as well as your revenue recognition? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Patrick, that's a great question. And when you're talking about process tools, you have modular systems. And so they kind of come together at the customer site in a lot of cases between the automation and then the gas boxes and the process chambers. And so if you're missing parts, sometimes, you have that issue. \n With our systems, and we internally source the handlers for our systems. But our systems ship completely, and so they don't come -- for the most part. I mean, we might have an issue here or there on the FPD business, where you'll have a similar dynamic. And in some cases, there isn't a reasonable carve-out based on the substance of the transaction where you defer some of the revenue. But it's a very, very small part of KLA.\n So on our semi process control part of the business, we're shipping complete systems. And so you wouldn't see a big correction in a deferred revenue that all of a sudden comes together as you move forward. So what we're shipping is complete systems, and that's what's revenue-ing as we go forward. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. \nVedvati Shrotre: I think my first question is I wanted to understand if you have a sense of what the industry wafer capacity is expected to grow in this year and for the next year. \n So WFE is expected to be around the mid-teens growth for this year. Like how does that translate to an increased capacity? If you can provide any color here. And I understand if you don't have an industry view, maybe you could talk to a subset of your customers, that would be helpful. \nBren Higgins: Yes. So at least $100 billion in WFE. It's translating. And I don't have the exact numbers, but we're seeing new wafer starts per month being added across all production nodes. And you're seeing it in memory at a limited level, certainly this year compared to prior years, less because it's more of a technology transition-focused year. \n But certainly, on the foundry logic side, you're seeing increases in the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer. And 7- and 10-nanometer is probably flattish, but then you get 28 and 40 and above and sort of those nodes. You've got the legacy investment that's happening there. So you're really seeing wafer start additions across just about all production nodes. \nVedvati Shrotre: So is that in line with WSE growth? That's what I was trying to get at. Or is it -- so is that like an 18% increase? Or if you could help me characterize what kind of capacity increase that is. \nBren Higgins: Yes, I don't think I can help you with that right now. By node, the capital intensity changes. And so it's not dollar for dollar in terms of how it applies to wafer starts at a given node. \nVedvati Shrotre: Got it. Okay. Okay. And for my follow-up. Four to 5 years ago, most of the customers used to talk about reusing about 70% to 80% of their tools. How has this changed now? Is this -- is majority of the WFE spend on capacity additions? Like how has that changed since, if you could help me understand. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. That's an interesting change in the dynamics of the industry. And that was really more isolated to one period in time than if you look at the overall history of the industry. And that was largely because there were not very many new starts on advanced nodes. There were primarily just a handful of customers, a handful of devices.\n And so that reuse was something that happened when Moore's Law wasn't scaling. We're seeing very little reuse now, and there's a couple of reasons for that. One of the primary reasons is the number of starts, the broad-based number of devices that's being run on these nodes and the ability of more and more customers to support that. That means that our customers are running flat out those technology nodes as they're introducing new ones. \n So we're actually seeing kind of the opposite effect, if you will. We're seeing some capacity. Some of our sales are actually into ramps that historically we would have considered to be done. And they're actually buying tools, for example, for 7-nanometer right now. There's still some of that going on in spite of the new investment being advanced. \n So reuse is significantly down in terms of the amount. And that's a trend that our customers believe is going to continue is that it's going to be a focus on supporting that. And if you look at the overall semiconductor shortage in the world, you can imagine that, that's not something that they can really afford to do because they're running those old lines flat out, and we see that in our service business and the overall fabulization around the world. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen. \nRobert Mertens: This is Rob Mertens on behalf of Krish. \n I guess, looking into the services, you've been growing the business nicely. You mentioned a strong installed base component in the quarter and just in general. But looking at the attach rate opportunity, I think you've mentioned maybe over 75% process control systems and maybe 90% in PCB. Is that a fair assessment? And is there further room to growth in terms of that side of the service business? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Look, certainly, as the tools increase in complexity and the demand on uptime increases, it does create opportunities for us to drive a contract model, a subscription-like model with those customers. \n And so we do think there's some upside potential over time, and we'll talk a little bit about some of the longer-term drivers of our service business and its trajectory going forward at our Investor Day in June. \n But obviously, PCB at closer to 90%, it's hard to improve much on that, but I think that there's still some opportunity on the semi PC side given the dynamics I mentioned. \n One of the other opportunities we have in our acquired businesses is to try to drive more and higher attach on those tools in terms of service. And certainly, smaller players have a harder time having the infrastructure to be able to engage with customers to try to monetize that service business.\n And so there's opportunities for us in our specialty semiconductor business, our flat panel business and some other smaller acquisitions we've done to drive more service opportunity. We'll have a lot more to say about it in June, but hopefully, that helps for now. \nRobert Mertens: Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the WFE view you gave and sort of peers are indicating, would assume that supply issues are going to sort of ease in the second half. What sort of incremental challenges have you seen within the industry over the past couple of months? Are there any sort of specific shortages, key components? Or is it sort of an ongoing rolling issue where things pop up and are dealt with and then other things pop up? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I think the whack-a-mole analogy is applicable here. It seems that as we work certain issues, other issues materialize. The dynamic in China with the COVID lockdowns does have some potential impact on some suppliers. Although we think we've dealt with it in the guidance we've given in terms of just our assessment of the risk profile of that. But I would say they're all the same issues, and we just continue to work, and the teams have done a really good job with it. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: First one for, maybe, Rick. If you can update us on your single beam eSL10 platform in terms of design wins and sales expectations this year. And the reason I asked that question is because we were at SPIE conference this year, and it appears that the multi-e-beam platforms are showing limited flexibility and gaps to HVM manufacturing at logic makers like Intel. And then I have a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I guess the landscape, let me just generalize and I would say the e-beam inspection landscape has not really dramatically shifted. We've had some success, as we indicated, with the eSL10. But if you back up and look more about the overall balance between optical and e-beam for inspection, it's continuing remarkably to be at about that 80/20 split from optical to e-beam. It's been true for over the years. \n So there are more e-beam applications, I think, that are showing up. The one -- for inspection, for example, that's showing up that we're participating in uniquely is for reticle inspection. And that's what we're doing with our new 8xx to address the -- some of the opportunities in EUV. \n But not really a lot has changed. I mean we go back and forth with the latest introductions from e-beam inspection. But by and large, we've had some success, but the market is on a relative basis -- overall, the EV market is about 20% to the 80% that is optical inspection. \n Bren, anything to add? \nBren Higgins: No, I think they're complementary technologies and scaling into production is the challenge, as you mentioned. And even as you increase the beams, it doesn't necessarily equate to a lot of throughput. It does equate to some, but there is still a challenge and the throughput disparity is quite significant relative to optical solutions.\n So it's relegated to defect discovery and engineering analysis-type cases and doesn't -- isn't all that applicable to a production environment. And that's -- I think it's been very well validated, I think, with the strength that we've seen in optical pattern inspection over the last few years. \nRichard Wallace: Just one more example. I think this is important to understand. If you look at calendar 2021, our Gen 4 optical actually outsold our Gen 5 optical in terms of amount of revenue in that split of the 80% of the market, and then the rest was divided in the e-beam among the different e-beam players. \n So this idea that the latest technologies would require e-beam inspection hasn't been proven. In fact, if anything, it shows the extendibility of optical as we -- even in 2021 and what we're seeing in 2022. In fact, we expect the Gen 4 to continue to have significant success in terms of serving the overall inspection needs. \n So the view is they'll be complementary. e-beam will primarily be a tool that will be used for engineering analysis but not for in-line inspection. \nAtif Malik: Great. And then my follow-up, Bren. Is it possible to break out the leading-edge sales, let's say, 10-nanometer or below, within your foundry logic sales? \nBren Higgins: Yes, it's about 80% is leading edge. Yes, that might include 14, 16, but that's only a few percent. So it's safe to say that pretty much 80% or so is 10-nanometer and below. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Piper Sandler. \nWeston Twigg: I just wanted to follow up on your comments about reticle outgrowing the market this year. Can you just let us -- help us understand why it undergrew a little bit last year? Was it customer mix? Or is it just lumpiness? And what makes you confident that you get faster than market growth this year? \nBren Higgins: Well, yes, last year, it was a very strong 2020 and then 2021 was below market growth. It was still an up year for the business but below the market. And then we do have more strength this year. It tends to be lumpy. \n If you're thinking about mass shop systems, so our Teron systems that we sell into the mass shop, those are very high-dollar -- revenue dollar tool. So the ASP is quite high. So they tend to skew the numbers a bit in that market given that. \n But certainly, we're seeing strength both in terms of EUV and new layers given the strength of foundry and logic, and that drives more reticle sets. And you've got, obviously, a lot of new designs, but you have re-spins of older designs. And so that's driving a lot of reticle demand. That's probably the biggest driver. \n You have also applications that are in the wafer fab for contamination monitoring. And we would also expect to see some revenue this year from the e-beam system that Rick mentioned as we get to the end of the year. \n So I think it's those factors that are driving that. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Wes, I would add one thing to it also is we're talking about the reticle inspector. But if you look at the application itself of qualifying reticles, a lot of the success we had in 2021 and continue to have now is use of Gen 5 to qualify EUV reticles. \n So while it may not be the rapid systems we're selling, it's the application in support of those, largely because that is the most effective way to determine the quality of those reticles is to actually inspect them. \n And finally, we have the capability to do it on the wafers with Gen 5. And so we saw a huge push from customers, multiple customers, everyone who's essentially doing EUV to utilize Gen 5 to qualify those reticles. \nWeston Twigg: Okay. That's helpful. And that actually leads to a follow-on question. Just as high NAV comes down the pipeline over the next 2 or 3 years, do you have a solution ready for that, maybe leveraging your optical inspection platform? Or do you have to develop something novel? \nRichard Wallace: We have continued evolution of the platforms to support it. And we continue to work on additional reticle capabilities to support it. So I think the answer is a little bit of both. \n I mean, the advantage of the on-wafer with the Gen 5 is that those tools already exist. And so right now, they could inspect those, albeit at a slower throughput. But of course, we're working on continuing to improve that capability both with increases in hardware but also a lot of the work we've been doing with machine learning and AI and the algorithm front to support those applications. \n And then at the same time, we have the 8xx which we'll continue to support, as well as 6xx. And as I think you know, we also are working on next-generation reticle inspection as well. \n So we got quite a bit of -- I think our 2 biggest investment programs inside the company are both dealing with the challenges of reticle inspection over the next several years. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Wes, and it looks like that brings us to the end of the call. \n I wanted just to again remind everyone that we're hoping we can see you in person in New York, June 16. If you don't have an invitation, please do reach out to KLA IR team, and we will get you one. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David for any final statements. \nOperator: And this does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin.\n Before getting into KLA's results in more detail, I want to acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. Their perseverance and drive to be better remains at the center of our consistent execution and outperformance. You have remained focused despite challenging macro and supply chain conditions as our high-performing teams that drove KLAs indispensability to customers, resulting in additional process control market share growth for the recently ended year. \n KLA's March quarter results demonstrate strong execution across multiple areas of our business in a persistently challenging supply chain environment, delivering revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance ranges for the quarter.  \n We once again displayed strong execution across multiple areas of our business. Our focus on consistently meeting commitments and delivering on our long-term strategic objectives and financial targets is the hallmark for which KLA is known and the standard by which we measure our success. \n Customer demand across major product groups continues to build as secular trends drive broad-based growth across a range of markets and applications served by the semiconductor industry. This robust demand has been putting pressure on the industry's ability to supply semiconductors.  \n Simultaneously, our leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to improve their competitive positioning while addressing growth in markets that demand new leading-edge semiconductor capabilities. Against this rising demand backdrop, KLA has remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and navigating supply chain challenges. \n Very important that KLA continues to operate with purpose and precision so we can create value for our customers, partners and shareholders by outperforming expectations. Our talented global teams both run and improve the KLA operating model and use it as a critical guide to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the evolving marketplace.  \n The market leader in process control, one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market, KLA remains in a position of strength when we look at the industry demand landscape. Semiconductor industry has evolved to be more significantly strategic and has an increasingly less cyclical end-market mix, with many fundamental drivers advancing the critical nature of semiconductors throughout the global economy.  \n Factors such as the continuing advancement of technology at the leading edge, increasing investment in legacy nodes, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging, are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor industry and for equipment and capabilities that make it possible.  \n Despite persistent supply challenges and macro headwinds, our outlook for the WFE industry this year remains intact, albeit with an expectation for a stronger second half than anticipated in January. We expect WFE demand to top $100 billion this calendar year, making it the third consecutive year of double-digit growth.  \n KLA's expected growth in calendar 2022 will mark the seventh consecutive year of growth. This sustained strength in customer demand is happening in an environment of increasing momentum for process control where KLA's market leadership has strengthened further, and our market share results remain 4x our nearest competitor.  \n KLA's expanding lead is the result of our #1 market position in some of the fastest-growing segments in WFE that have a market size greater than $1 billion in terms of annual revenue. We attribute KLA's strengthening market leadership to our ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategies, including investing at a high level to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges in the marketplace and help our customers drive their growth strategy.\n We're pleased to see the success of our strategies validated by our customers' purchasing decisions and reflected in the April 2022 Gartner market share report, showing KLA's market leadership advancement. This emphasizes the power of the portfolio strategy we employ. \n The recently published Gartner market share report shows process control was one of the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, growing 43% in the year to $10.4 billion. KLA's share of process control grew approximately 1 percentage point to over 54% and has increased over 3 percentage points since 2018 and remains greater than 4x our nearest competitor across all regions.\n Within process control, the optical inspection market grew to approximately $2.5 billion in annual sales, outpacing WFE by 40%, and our share of this market remained above 80%. Other highlights demonstrate the power of KLA's portfolio strategy in delivering strong growth in other critical process control markets, including metrology, macro inspection and very strong growth in e-beam review. \n Turning now to the top 5 highlights for the March 2022 quarter. First, KLA's market leadership in some of the most critical and fastest-growing markets in WFE continues to fuel growth. We remain nimble and innovative in addressing global supply challenges to meet customer requirements and our financial targets.\n Foundry and Logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity remain a tailwind. In memory, demand is broad-based across multiple customers.\n Second, our optical metrology business stood out in the March quarter, driven by KLA's market leadership and increasing customer adoption of market applications and leading-edge technology development and capacity monitoring. Optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and critical next-generation architectures, including gate-all-around and multi-stack 160-plus layer 3D NAND. This was further illustrated in the new Gartner market share report, which showed 50% growth in 2021.  \n Third, KLA is intensifying our efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolio of both the SPC and EPC groups. KLA is broadening our product portfolio and delivering a comprehensive suite of products and technologies that include wafer-level packaging and final assembly and test products for advanced packaging markets, and a portfolio of inspection systems and process tools designed to help customers achieve their 0 defect goals.  \n These collaborations continue to grow with KLA recording our highest-ever customer engagement in terms of wafer inspection revenue for automotive applications in the March quarter.  \n Fourth, services revenue was $488 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company tallied a record 349 installs in the March quarter, well above the previous high of 293. This was a remarkable achievement given travel restrictions in Asia, lockdowns related to COVID-19 and complexities related to the supply -- current supply environment.  \n Service revenue is consistently outperforming the 9% to 11% long-term growth target, driven by growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, higher utilization rates, and expansion of service opportunities in the legacy nodes.  \n Finally, the March quarter was another exceptional period from a free cash flow perspective. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $719 million for 23% year-over-year growth. We've also remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase programs, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including a $565 million in quarterly share repurchases and an additional $159 million in dividends in the March quarter.  \n Before passing the call over to Bren to review the financial highlights and guidance, let me summarize briefly. KLA's March quarter demonstrates sustained outperformance, highlighting the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives. Our consistent strong execution against significant challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of meeting rising demand and addressing persistent supply issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.\n KLA is exceptionally positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we continue to see more customer interest driven by technology change than ever before at the leading edge.  \n Simultaneously, the need for increasing performance and reliability requirements for legacy nodes to support evolving markets like automotive and 5G are also important to help deliver new capabilities. We believe KLA will continue to benefit from numerous secular growth factors that drive long-term industry demand. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide durable free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren. Yes. Just to add a couple of things, Harlan. One is, of course, Gartner's data is revenue and the bookings picture is even stronger. So we're in really good shape in terms of that.\n We've talked about the backlog and the demand that we have. So we'll continue to see share gain in terms of -- or strength of share in the segments that you outlined. Also, the new technologies that are coming offer more process control intensity opportunities.  \n For example, high-k/metal gate, if you look at that, if you look at gate-all-around, the metrology, bigger die size, all those things are going to allow -- there would be more opportunity. And we have products in the queue as well as in the field that are going to take advantage of that. So we feel very well positioned.  \n The biggest challenges we've talked about is satisfying demand, and that's related to -- we think we've done a really good job with supply chain, but there's more work to do there to continue to support our customers. Yes, Harlan. So in terms of the systems part of EPC, we're somewhere close to 20% is our expectation for the year. Obviously, we'll have to see how that plays out. That tends to be a little bit of a shorter lead time business and have some parts of its markets that are a little bit more sensitive to some of the consumer dynamics.\n But in general, we expect to see about a 20% growth there. Now if you blend it with its service business, it will be in the high teens. That service business tends to grow a little bit slower than that.  \n But you're right, over the last couple of years, on the systems side, we've been in that 20% range. And it hasn't gotten as much of a play as -- given the strength of our semi process control business. But we're pleased with where we're going directionally there. And we'll have more to say about the longer-term view at our Investor Day in mid-June. Yes, C.J, it's a great question. Right now, blended lead times, and they're blended across right products and the revenue value of the composition of the backlog, but it's well over a year now in terms of where lead times are. Obviously, certain product lines are longer than that. We're slotting certain product lines now today out into 2024. So there's quite a bit of demand for some of the products.\n And given the constraints we have around key components and the lead time for those components, it just pushes that -- those lead times out. So overall, we've seen it trend up here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, as we go through the year, I continue to expect to see demand exceeding supply. So I would expect lead times to probably increase a little bit as we move over the course of the year. Well, our guidance implies a risk-adjusted assessment of where we're at. Obviously, there's always some unknowns about that, both from a supply point of view, which we feel pretty good about, but also more so from just can we get access to customers, can we get tools installed, can we get acceptances done and so on.\n We've contemplated that in the guidance we've given. We do have an expectation of seeing some opening begin in the, call it, sort of the middle of May. If things drift out further than that or there's a significant expansion of lockdown activity, it could have more of an impact. \n But we -- I think we've risk-adjusted it as best as we can. There's certainly some unknowns. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. Joe, it's Rick. It wasn't really -- it was much more about the impact to cost about when they're hired. We actually did quite well of hiring in Q1. It's just if they're not hired at the beginning of the quarter and we factored in the payroll for the whole quarter, we're on track for our hiring this year. \n And most of that had to do, frankly, more with some of the engineering work than it does the work that's associated with both operations and service, where you could potentially, if you didn't have the resources, see a shortfall for the year.  \n But even then, it would just -- right now, we're trying to alleviate the teams who are doing a lot of overtime and trying to provide them some backfill. So none of our hiring challenges are affecting our ability to support the revenue for this year or next year. But we do want to get people in, and we've had good success, but it's more -- we're talking months as opposed to quarters or years behind. Yes, good question, and one that -- obviously, we're excited about the EPC acquisition for exactly this. So I would say really, for EPC, even in earlier question we had about how we're doing and how we think about it, I really think of it in 3 stages. The first stage for EPC for KLA was to employ the operating model and how we run the businesses, and that was really what we did initially.  \n The second stage was customer engagement. And because, as you say, some of these customers are bigger customers, have more complex problems. And they know KLA, they wanted to engage with us. So that's actually been going quite well, and we've been having a lot of discussions.  \n But of course, then you get to the third part of that, which is technology leverage from the rest of KLA into EPC. And we're kind of in Phase 2 and Phase 3 now where we've been having those meetings. There are a lot of clear opportunities for us, and we're developing those solutions and rolling those out.\n So I think that you'll see the leverage, the revenue synergy associated from the additional channel access and the needs and then the benefit of our technology as we go forward. That's really -- that's coming. We're going to talk more about that at the Analyst Day in June as we roll that out. But right now, huge opportunities, and we feel like we're just at time with that acquisition to be in a position to support them. Yes. That's an interesting change in the dynamics of the industry. And that was really more isolated to one period in time than if you look at the overall history of the industry. And that was largely because there were not very many new starts on advanced nodes. There were primarily just a handful of customers, a handful of devices.\n And so that reuse was something that happened when Moore's Law wasn't scaling. We're seeing very little reuse now, and there's a couple of reasons for that. One of the primary reasons is the number of starts, the broad-based number of devices that's being run on these nodes and the ability of more and more customers to support that. That means that our customers are running flat out those technology nodes as they're introducing new ones. \n So we're actually seeing kind of the opposite effect, if you will. We're seeing some capacity. Some of our sales are actually into ramps that historically we would have considered to be done. And they're actually buying tools, for example, for 7-nanometer right now. There's still some of that going on in spite of the new investment being advanced. \n So reuse is significantly down in terms of the amount. And that's a trend that our customers believe is going to continue is that it's going to be a focus on supporting that. And if you look at the overall semiconductor shortage in the world, you can imagine that, that's not something that they can really afford to do because they're running those old lines flat out, and we see that in our service business and the overall fabulization around the world. Yes. Look, certainly, as the tools increase in complexity and the demand on uptime increases, it does create opportunities for us to drive a contract model, a subscription-like model with those customers. \n And so we do think there's some upside potential over time, and we'll talk a little bit about some of the longer-term drivers of our service business and its trajectory going forward at our Investor Day in June. \n But obviously, PCB at closer to 90%, it's hard to improve much on that, but I think that there's still some opportunity on the semi PC side given the dynamics I mentioned. \n One of the other opportunities we have in our acquired businesses is to try to drive more and higher attach on those tools in terms of service. And certainly, smaller players have a harder time having the infrastructure to be able to engage with customers to try to monetize that service business.\n And so there's opportunities for us in our specialty semiconductor business, our flat panel business and some other smaller acquisitions we've done to drive more service opportunity. We'll have a lot more to say about it in June, but hopefully, that helps for now. Yes. I think the whack-a-mole analogy is applicable here. It seems that as we work certain issues, other issues materialize. The dynamic in China with the COVID lockdowns does have some potential impact on some suppliers. Although we think we've dealt with it in the guidance we've given in terms of just our assessment of the risk profile of that. But I would say they're all the same issues, and we just continue to work, and the teams have done a really good job with it. Yes. I guess the landscape, let me just generalize and I would say the e-beam inspection landscape has not really dramatically shifted. We've had some success, as we indicated, with the eSL10. But if you back up and look more about the overall balance between optical and e-beam for inspection, it's continuing remarkably to be at about that 80/20 split from optical to e-beam. It's been true for over the years. \n So there are more e-beam applications, I think, that are showing up. The one -- for inspection, for example, that's showing up that we're participating in uniquely is for reticle inspection. And that's what we're doing with our new 8xx to address the -- some of the opportunities in EUV. \n But not really a lot has changed. I mean we go back and forth with the latest introductions from e-beam inspection. But by and large, we've had some success, but the market is on a relative basis -- overall, the EV market is about 20% to the 80% that is optical inspection. \n Bren, anything to add? Just one more example. I think this is important to understand. If you look at calendar 2021, our Gen 4 optical actually outsold our Gen 5 optical in terms of amount of revenue in that split of the 80% of the market, and then the rest was divided in the e-beam among the different e-beam players. \n So this idea that the latest technologies would require e-beam inspection hasn't been proven. In fact, if anything, it shows the extendibility of optical as we -- even in 2021 and what we're seeing in 2022. In fact, we expect the Gen 4 to continue to have significant success in terms of serving the overall inspection needs. \n So the view is they'll be complementary. e-beam will primarily be a tool that will be used for engineering analysis but not for in-line inspection. Yes. Wes, I would add one thing to it also is we're talking about the reticle inspector. But if you look at the application itself of qualifying reticles, a lot of the success we had in 2021 and continue to have now is use of Gen 5 to qualify EUV reticles. \n So while it may not be the rapid systems we're selling, it's the application in support of those, largely because that is the most effective way to determine the quality of those reticles is to actually inspect them. \n And finally, we have the capability to do it on the wafers with Gen 5. And so we saw a huge push from customers, multiple customers, everyone who's essentially doing EUV to utilize Gen 5 to qualify those reticles. We have continued evolution of the platforms to support it. And we continue to work on additional reticle capabilities to support it. So I think the answer is a little bit of both. \n I mean, the advantage of the on-wafer with the Gen 5 is that those tools already exist. And so right now, they could inspect those, albeit at a slower throughput. But of course, we're working on continuing to improve that capability both with increases in hardware but also a lot of the work we've been doing with machine learning and AI and the algorithm front to support those applications. \n And then at the same time, we have the 8xx which we'll continue to support, as well as 6xx. And as I think you know, we also are working on next-generation reticle inspection as well. \n So we got quite a bit of -- I think our 2 biggest investment programs inside the company are both dealing with the challenges of reticle inspection over the next several years."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. \n Our results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. We continue to focus on meeting customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, increasing gross and operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.  \n Quarterly revenue was $2.289 billion at the upper end of the guided range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was above the midpoint of guidance at 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected semiconductor process control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter.  \n Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.13, also towards the upper end of the guided range of $4.35 to $5.25. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.83. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $484 million, below our expectation of $495 million, mostly due to the pace of new hiring, which was slower than originally planned. Total operating expenses were comprised of $285 million in R&D and $199 million in SG&A.  \n Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion of our business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model to facilitate growth. This includes investing in new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis.\n Furthermore, we, as most companies, are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and adjustments related to our annual merit process that went into effect during March. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow to approximately $525 million in the June quarter, and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to trend higher over the balance of 2022, along with our sequential revenue growth expectations. \n We continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over our normalized time horizon.\n Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was once again strong at 41.7% in the March quarter. Other income and expense net was $46 million compared with guidance of $41 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the mark-to-market impact of a strategic supply investment.\n For the June quarter, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $43 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.6%, above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share at the guided tax rate would have been $5.20. Non-GAAP net income was $776 million. GAAP net income was $731 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $719 million, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 93% and free cash flow margin of 31.4%.\n Looking at revenue by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.98 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as expected. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix for foundry logic customers was approximately 63%. Memory was approximately 37%, with a further breakdown comprised of 26% from DRAM customers and 11% from NAND.  \n Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in automotive, 5G and advanced packaging. Within EPC, the specialty semiconductor process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated revenue of $117 million, up 28% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $193 million, down 6% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. \n For an additional breakdown of revenue by major products in region, please see the shareholder letter and slides.  \n In terms of the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in total cash, debt of $3.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We have growing confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns to shareholders that enables growing dividends and increased share repurchases.  \n Over the long term, we target returning at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our capital return strategy underscores our strong record of predictable and productive capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $620 million in dividends paid. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and a strong free cash flow margin across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions.  \n Turning to the outlook. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook for calendar '22 remains unchanged. We expect the WFE market to grow in the mid-teens to over $100 billion in 2022, off a higher base of approximately $87 billion in calendar '21 after assessing reported results for the December quarter.  \n Although based on pure company March reporting, it appears that industry supply issues will increase the loading in the second half of the year. This reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across all customer segments. While we add capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.\n In addition, the duration and potential expansion of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are unknown and could adversely impact some suppliers with operations in the affected areas. Furthermore, these lockdowns could delay systems installations and customer acceptance processes due to resource mobility restrictions in the country. In short, the situation is fluid and will be monitored closely.\n Supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. We still expect to see quarterly sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2022 and overall revenue growth for the calendar year to exceed 20%. In addition, we believe that demand will continue to exceed supply through the remainder of the calendar year. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our semiconductor process control business and strong relative growth overall. \n Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile. Our bookings momentum and strong backlog positions us to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support this outlook and our customers' growing process control requirements.\n Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.425 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 56%, and memory is expected to be approximately 44% of semiconductor process control systems revenue.\n Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 66% of the segment and NAND is forecasted to be about 34%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as we expect sequential growth in EPC revenue in the quarter and a slightly weaker product mix within semi process control to dilute margins modestly versus the March quarter.\n Longer term, infrastructure investments, labor cost inflation, supply chain strain and rising global logistics costs are surpassing the benefits of economies of scale normally seen in a rising revenue environment. Given expectations for revenue for the year, we continue to expect that calendar '22 gross margins will be in a range of 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points.\n Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $525 million, other income and expense net of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $5.70. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.93 to $6.03. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 150 million shares.\n In closing, the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE are compelling despite the current macroeconomic headwinds. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. \n We have confidence in the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and bookings visibility, which motivates us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future.\n KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to shareholders.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Yes. Harlan, I'll go ahead and start and let Rick add if he needs to here. But it was a very strong year, obviously, for the company. And we're really pleased with the share results. \n One of the things as we look at just our expectation this year is we expect to see continued momentum in a lot of the markets that you referenced, so there's certainly strength that's expected there. We're expecting greater than market growth out of our reticle inspection business, which was a little slower than market last year, and it tends to be a lumpier business. But as we move into this year, it should be a little bit stronger.\n So overall, we feel pretty good about the road map across our products. As we said in the prepared remarks, our biggest challenge is just getting the parts we need to meet the very strong customer demand that's out there.\n But we're encouraged by the momentum we have, and our internal plan is to continue to gain share. We think there's more opportunity for us given what you said in terms of where we are. We go linearly, but at the same time, we've had a nice trajectory over the last few years and would expect to see it grow as we move forward. Yes. So Tim, you'll see the exact number in the 10-Q that we file. And it's the performance obligations, not purchase commitments. But anyway, the performance obligations, where you're right, we're over $8 billion last quarter and we'll be in excess of $10 billion this quarter. And to my earlier comment, I think we'll see book-to-bill above 1 through the year. Tim, usually, that doesn't impact us all that much because we tend to see process control tools go in early. Also, given the demand environment, customers will deal with timing issues in terms of taking tools and storing them to align with expectations around their other tool sets.  \n So I'm less concerned about that given that the strength of demand. Customers are beating on us every day to ship sooner, so I'm not I'm not concerned about delays in other types of tools impacting our products.  \n And you're right, we did have -- Q1 was stronger. Certainly the execution by the teams in the last month as we dealt with a lot of delays in parts, particularly around automation for our systems, the execution was really solid. And we're really pleased with the upside we saw in Q1.\n So as I think about the second half, the second half, I'm still in the same range, low to mid-teens in terms of semiconductor process control systems. So half to half versus the first half. Yes, Joe, it's mostly technology transitions this year. And certainly, the introduction of EUV and DRAM has been a driver for investment from our customers. It's pretty broad. As I look at the DRAM investment, it's pretty broad-based across our customer set. Yes, Patrick, that's a great question. And when you're talking about process tools, you have modular systems. And so they kind of come together at the customer site in a lot of cases between the automation and then the gas boxes and the process chambers. And so if you're missing parts, sometimes, you have that issue. \n With our systems, and we internally source the handlers for our systems. But our systems ship completely, and so they don't come -- for the most part. I mean, we might have an issue here or there on the FPD business, where you'll have a similar dynamic. And in some cases, there isn't a reasonable carve-out based on the substance of the transaction where you defer some of the revenue. But it's a very, very small part of KLA.\n So on our semi process control part of the business, we're shipping complete systems. And so you wouldn't see a big correction in a deferred revenue that all of a sudden comes together as you move forward. So what we're shipping is complete systems, and that's what's revenue-ing as we go forward. Yes. So at least $100 billion in WFE. It's translating. And I don't have the exact numbers, but we're seeing new wafer starts per month being added across all production nodes. And you're seeing it in memory at a limited level, certainly this year compared to prior years, less because it's more of a technology transition-focused year. \n But certainly, on the foundry logic side, you're seeing increases in the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer. And 7- and 10-nanometer is probably flattish, but then you get 28 and 40 and above and sort of those nodes. You've got the legacy investment that's happening there. So you're really seeing wafer start additions across just about all production nodes. Yes, I don't think I can help you with that right now. By node, the capital intensity changes. And so it's not dollar for dollar in terms of how it applies to wafer starts at a given node. No, I think they're complementary technologies and scaling into production is the challenge, as you mentioned. And even as you increase the beams, it doesn't necessarily equate to a lot of throughput. It does equate to some, but there is still a challenge and the throughput disparity is quite significant relative to optical solutions.\n So it's relegated to defect discovery and engineering analysis-type cases and doesn't -- isn't all that applicable to a production environment. And that's -- I think it's been very well validated, I think, with the strength that we've seen in optical pattern inspection over the last few years. Yes, it's about 80% is leading edge. Yes, that might include 14, 16, but that's only a few percent. So it's safe to say that pretty much 80% or so is 10-nanometer and below. Well, yes, last year, it was a very strong 2020 and then 2021 was below market growth. It was still an up year for the business but below the market. And then we do have more strength this year. It tends to be lumpy. \n If you're thinking about mass shop systems, so our Teron systems that we sell into the mass shop, those are very high-dollar -- revenue dollar tool. So the ASP is quite high. So they tend to skew the numbers a bit in that market given that. \n But certainly, we're seeing strength both in terms of EUV and new layers given the strength of foundry and logic, and that drives more reticle sets. And you've got, obviously, a lot of new designs, but you have re-spins of older designs. And so that's driving a lot of reticle demand. That's probably the biggest driver. \n You have also applications that are in the wafer fab for contamination monitoring. And we would also expect to see some revenue this year from the e-beam system that Rick mentioned as we get to the end of the year. \n So I think it's those factors that are driving that."

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. \n Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. Before summarizing KLA's results for calendar year 2021 and for the December quarter, I'd like to first acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. The dedication and hard work of our teams never wavered despite challenging conditions, delivering for customers and managing around a complex global supply chain during a period of unprecedented industry shortages. \n It was the day-to-day drive to be better that drove KLA's market leadership, resulting in record growth and financial performance across the board for the company in the December quarter and for 2021. KLA also delivered record returns to shareholders in 2021 through our dividend and share repurchase programs with returns to shareholders totaling over $2 billion. \n KLA's strong results demonstrate our track record of relative strength and revenue growth and superior financial performance compared with semiconductor industry peers in a dynamic and growing wafer fab equipment industry as well as the long-term value created by employee and consistently refining our KLA operating model. Since our founding in 1976, KLA's mission has been focused on using our expertise and innovative thinking to overcome monumental technological challenges. \n KLA is advancing humanity with technologies and ideas that inspire action. Our results in the December quarter and for 2021, demonstrate ongoing success of these strategies. So thank you to all our teams for contributing to KLA's enduring success. 2021 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow for KLA, as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges in the marketplace, responding to record demand across the vast majority of our markets, while adapting to the evolving operational complexities associated with the global pandemic. \n Through it all, we remained focused on delivering to our customers' requirements and driving strong returns to shareholders in a rapidly growing industry demand environment. In 2021, revenue grew 34% to $8.2 billion, marking the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth. \n KLA's strong revenue growth in 2021 was driven by 46% growth in the semiconductor process control systems. Revenue from the services business grew 14% in the year, with over 75% of the revenue generated from recurring subscription-like contracts, reflecting the growing value of added process control systems and services in our product portfolio. \n KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2021 with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 54% and 61%, respectively. Incremental operating margin on the revenue growth in 2021 was 57%, consistently above our target operating leverage model of 40% to 50% for the second year in a row. \n Free cash flow also grew a healthy 43% in 2021 to a record $2.5 billion. Consistent with our long-term strategic objectives, KLA delivered on our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, including our 12th consecutive dividend increase announced in July 2021, along with an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. \n Total returns to shareholders in 2021, including dividend and share repurchases, topped just over $2 billion or approximately 79% of free cash flow. This growth demonstrates success in strengthening our market leadership across our business that we can continue to build upon to drive adoption of KLA solutions in the critical markets we serve. Within the Electronics, Packaging and Component inspection or EPC Group, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment grew 11% in 2021, and the Printed Circuit Board Display and Component Inspection grew 17% in the year. \n The strong relative performance for KLA reflects our market leadership and diversification and was driven by secular industry growth trends across multiple end markets. We ended 2021 with an exceptionally strong backlog and began what we anticipate being a seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. We enter 2022 executing at a high level and operating from a position of strength in our marketplace despite persistent supply chain challenges. \n This momentum sets the stage for KLA to continue to outperform the market while demonstrating superior financial performance and maintaining our capital returns. Turning now to focus on the December quarter results where we saw diversified strength across our business. Today, demand environment continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of a broad spectrum of semiconductor and electronic industry growth trends. \n Technology is transforming how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, growth in new automotive electronics and strong growth in data centers and 5G communication markets. \n Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control, and growth and expansion in new markets like Specialty Semiconductor Process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasing digital world. \n To make this happen, KLA continues to prioritize and invest in R&D, which totaled $1 billion in calendar 2021, double the level of 5 years ago and growing at a 15% compound annual growth rate. With this favorable backdrop and our demonstrated track record of investing heavily in R&D to drive product differentiation and consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to customers and shareholders, our performance enabled KLA to outperform the 2023 long-term financial model targets that we set 2 years ago, 2 years ahead of expectations. \n Moving along to the top highlights from the December 2021 quarter. First, we saw continued strength and consistency in foundry logic customer revenue for both leading edge and legacy technologies in the December quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew in the period. Calendar 2022 is setting up to be another year of strong growth for WFE. \n We see demand momentum throughout 2022 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. In foundry and logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers, and we expect another year of double-digit growth in 2022 with NAND growing faster than DRAM; second, KLA is seeing strong demand across the breadth of our industry-leading optical inspection portfolio as we have maintained our momentum in one of the fastest-growing markets in WFE. \n Wafer inspection systems revenues grew 54% in 2021, far outpacing the WFE market, which is estimated to have grown 40%. We're experiencing strong growth across our wafer inspection portfolio from broadband plasma, laser scanning, unpatterned bare wafer inspection, macro inspection and e-beam products. \n This quarter, we highlight macro inspection, which is growing at a pace of 1.5x WFE driven by growth in automotive and other specialty markets where KLA has defensible market leadership with a platform uniquely positioned to address growing technical complexity and tighter design rules; third, success in KLA's strategic growth and market diversification strategies are being demonstrated by growth in EPC. \n Systems revenue from KLA's Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, grew 20% in 2021. With EPC, KLA is diversifying our market leadership with a portfolio of solutions addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, including RF, specialty semiconductors, automotive, PCB, advanced packaging and display; fourth, service revenue grew 14% in 2021 to $1.8 billion and continues to sustain a growth rate above its long-term target of 9% to 11%. For the quarter, services revenue was $457 million or 19% of total revenue. Annual services revenue is quickly approaching $2 billion and has grown 81% in the past 3 years. \n This growth has been driven by the rising installed base and increasing adoption of subscription-like contracts. Over 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment, and over 90% of services in the printed circuit board business come from recurring subscription-like contracts. \n Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional one from a free cash flow perspective, capping a year in which KLA generated over $2.5 billion in free cash flow and returned over $2 billion to shareholders. In the December quarter, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, which helped drive 43% growth in free cash flow in 2021. We've also maintained focus on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share repurchase program, which rose 63% year-over-year on a combined basis. \n Before Bren gets into greater detail on our financial highlights and guidance, let me briefly summarize. Despite the persistent disruption and continued challenges associated with the pandemic, particularly around the supply chain and component availability, KLA is consistently delivering strong revenue growth, financial results and returns to shareholders. \n KLA is well positioned at the forefront of technological innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products targeting the most demanding inspection and measurement challenges in the marketplace. I also want to provide a quick update on our ESG activities. On December 16, KLA announced setting a goal to use 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030. Managing the impacts of our business in terms of ESG stewardship is an integral part of KLA's mission to advance humanity. This includes contributing to creating a more sustainable future. \n With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's December quarter and 2021 results highlight the continuation of strong execution in a dynamic and challenging market environment. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. \n The December quarter capped off a year in 2021 that was defined by strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. We also invested almost $1 billion in R&D to sustain our success and $250 million in capital expenditures to grow our global infrastructure to support our industry growth thesis. All this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. \n Total revenue in the December quarter was $2.35 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of $2.225 billion to $2.425 billion and up 13% sequentially versus the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.1%, just above the midpoint of the guided range of 62% to 64%. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.71 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.59, each within the guidance range. \n Gross margins were 63.1% and in line with expectations as product mix and factory expenses ended the quarter mostly as planned. KLA's gross margin reflects the value we deliver to the marketplace and our competitive differentiation. To improve on our ability to meet our customer needs, we are also making meaningful investments in our global workforce, supply chain and factory infrastructure to position KLA to deliver our products in this growing demand environment. \n Total non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly below the midpoint of the guided range of $465 million, including $265 million of R&D expense and $200 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was 43.4% in the December quarter. KLA's innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. \n R&D is at the heart of what we do and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy, new product introduction cadence and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model, as well as new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. \n Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and within outsourced partners. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $495 million in the March quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. \n While operating expenses are modeled higher going forward as we will make the necessary investments to scale our business to support our long-term structural industry growth thesis, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. \n Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $39 million, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.3%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it remains prudent to maintain our long-term tax planning rate at 13.5% going forward. \n Non-GAAP net income was $851 million. GAAP net income was $717 million. Cash flow from operations was $811 million, and free cash flow was $746 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 88% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of 32%. The company had approximately 152 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding exiting the quarter. \n Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $2.05 billion, up 49% compared with the December 2020 quarter and up 15% sequentially. Semiconductor Process Control systems and service grew 39% in calendar '21 versus calendar 2020. \n Foundry logic was 71% of the approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix in the December quarter and memory was 29%. Within memory, the business was split roughly 54% DRAM and 46% NAND. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging and Components Group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. \n More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business generated record revenue of $113 million, up 24% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. Specialty Semiconductor Process systems and service grew 11% for calendar '21. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $188 million, up 5% year-over-year, but down 7% sequentially. On a full calendar year basis, it grew 17%. \n Our breakdown of revenue by major products and region can be found in the shareholder letter, so I won't cover those here. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of 70% or more of free cash flow generated. \n In 2021, KLA exceeded our long-term capital returns target, returning over $2 billion to shareholders, including $601 million in dividends paid and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. \n KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the December quarter, we repurchased $430 million of common stock and paid $160 million in dividends. \n As we begin the new year, our view is that the WFE market will grow in the high teens, topping $100 billion off a baseline of approximately $86 billion for 2021. WFE demand is still constrained by the industry's ability to supply. Strong industry growth momentum in 2022 across all end markets is expected to drive growth with the strongest percentage growth coming from foundry logic customers. And memory investment will be led by 3D NAND. \n Now wrapping up with our outlook and guidance. Looking ahead, our backlog remains strong and sales funnel visibility over the near-term horizon is good. However, rising product lead times driven by increased supply chain constraints is limiting our near-term output. These issues are reducing our revenue expectation by 8% to 10% for the March quarter. \n Specifically, COVID-related disruptions at a number of single-source suppliers have exacerbated what has already been a difficult supply situation where these suppliers have been challenged to meet demand by running their production at max capacity. These disruptions are causing delays in parts delivery timing across multiple product platforms. In addition, numerous electronic component sourcing challenges have become more acute over the past month as these are standardized parts and in demand across multiple industries. \n We expect that the COVID-related impact will begin to abate shortly and new capacity or supply alternatives are expected to become available as we move through the calendar year. While these issues can be fluid and difficult to predict in the short run, we expect the March quarter revenue to represent the low point for calendar 2022, and we remain exceedingly confident in the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. \n Given current expectations for growth in WFE and other electronics markets, we feel confident in our ability to grow throughout the year with total company revenue growth exceeding 20% and semiconductor process control systems revenue to outperform WFE growth again. Our confidence is based on current backlog levels, competitive positioning, strong customer engagement, and steps we continue to take to add capacity to address output constraints in what continues to be a robust demand environment. \n Our March quarter 2022 guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 59% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue. \n Memory is expected to be approximately 41%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as overall revenue levels declined modestly on a sequential basis and product mix dilutes gross margins by roughly 50 basis points versus the prior quarter. To provide some color for the calendar year, given higher revenue volume, product mix expectations across our various segments offset by expected cost pressures within our supply chain, we are modeling gross margins to be approximately 63% for the year, plus or minus 50 basis points. \n Other model assumptions for the March quarter include operating expenses of approximately $495 million, interest and other expense of approximately $41 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.54, plus or minus $0.45, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.80 plus or minus $0.45. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 151 million shares. In conclusion, we have exceptionally strong and diversified end market dynamics propelling semiconductors and the essential WFE investments required to make them. \n Furthermore, we are seeing revenue growth opportunities as more innovation occurs and technology complexity increases in specialty semiconductors, advanced packaging and other electronics markets. Finally, our services offerings continue to deliver more value to our customers in our Semiconductor Process Control business, and their evolving opportunities to further expand our value proposition in our acquired businesses. Our record backlog is supported by solid customer demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. \n 2022 is setting up to be the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for WFE and the seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. The KLA operating model fuels KLA's strategic objectives and positions us to outperform the industry in terms of growth and financial performance. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. \n They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat and strong record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Go ahead and queue for questions. Sorry about that. \nOperator: No worries. [Operator Instructions] \n We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Rick, as you pointed out in your prepared comments, you guys have been dealing and the industry has been dealing with a difficult supply situation all year, but this is the first quarter that you and others have seen to have a meaningful impact on the business. \n And I'm kind of curious as to what specifically happened in the last 90 days to make things worse. And I guess, more importantly, as you call March as the bottom, what gives you confidence that these problems won't persist even longer? \nRichard Wallace: John, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel pretty good about how we've navigated through the pandemic. A couple of factors for KLA specific, I think, to think about. One is we were up in the December quarter. And again, huge customer demand, so working to work that off. We talked in the past about securing critical components, critical parts from key suppliers. That actually continues to be in good shape, where we had some challenges in the last few weeks. \n And right now, as we're actually working through them, had to do with not necessarily our critical supply but just generalized supply across the industry. I think as most companies are talking about. So we're seeing some of that, that are not unique, as Bren said in his comments, to KLA. The reason we feel more confident is even in the last few days, we've seen some pressure being released in that system, that it won't be in time for what we would have preferred to ship in this quarter, we obviously have the backlog, we could have shipped more if we'd had it. \n But it's being resolved. So we feel pretty good about the go forward after we get through March. And I'll let Bren add some color since he's spending a good part of his time working some of these issues himself. \nBren Higgins: Hey John, how are you? So just to add to Rick's comments. I think one of the things you have to consider is most of our strategic buffer that we've built, whether we have it in inventory levels at the company, whether it's at inventory or long lead time materials that we've either procured or suppliers have procured. Over the last 15 months or so, given the strength of demand, we have worked through a fair amount of that. And that's one of the challenges we have is we are more dependent today on the predictability of timing, first of all, but also volume of quality. And so I think those are issues that we continue to work through. As Rick said, in our complex systems, we generally have a pretty transparent view of where that demand is, although everyone is struggling to meet the demand environment that we're facing today. \n But it's in our higher volume but single sourced type products where we've seen some of these pressures. We did not anticipate a COVID variant and what that would do to those factories in terms of people having to leave either because of contact or exposure. So you had facilities that are already running 100% max that all of a sudden had to deal with this disruption in a lot of cases, a pretty meaningful disruption in the first part of the month. \n We think that, that's abating. And we're getting a sense that that's improving. And this COVID environment, we'll have to figure out and navigate our way through. We don't know what the future holds. But at least in terms of the near-term environment, we feel pretty good about that. \n And then trying to source and find all the electrical components, which are deeper in our build of material and within our supply chain. There's less visibility, but there's also alternative, either alternative supplies, qualifying new parts in some cases, leveraging third parties, which we've been doing, and that's even becoming more challenged in terms of distributors and others that might be out there that have those parts. \n So we're managing through this. We're escalating where appropriate. And as we look at it and walk through what we expect to see moving forward, we think the March quarter sets up as the bottom, and we expect -- given the guidance we gave that we would see growth through the year and expect the company to be somewhere in excess of 20%, as we said in the prepared remarks. So there's always some questions or unpredictability here in terms of just where things are, but that's the best of how we see it today. \nJohn Pitzer: And then, Bren, just as my follow-up. You gave some very specific guidance for OpEx even beyond the March quarter, growing sequentially throughout the year, but still within the model of 40% to 50% incremental gross -- operating margin, sorry. I'm just kind of curious, I have to imagine that this year, the supply constraints are causing some excess costs that might bleed down over time as supply gets better. \n And there's a bigger mismatch, I'm assuming between revenue collection and investment this year. So as you start to recapture some of this revenue as supply gets better, should we assume that incremental op margins closer to the higher end of that 40% to 50%? Or how should we think about that as revenue growth accelerates beyond March? \nBren Higgins: Yes. No, you're thinking about it right. As we see revenue growth, it should accelerate to the higher end of the range. The commentary was really about how we look and size the company on an annual basis or over a longer-term horizon. And if you look at '19 to our '22 planning, we will have had incremental operating margins given the growth we've seen in excess of 50%, about 52%. So my point was that we would expect revenue to grow. We're also expecting OpEx to grow. But at the end of the day, as we're sizing 2022, we expect to be in our target range of 40 to 50. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Great execution by the operations team. In calendar '21, your Process Control Systems business outgrew WFE by about 8 percentage points. So strong performance there. So as we look at your WFE outlook for this year, right, up 16% to $100 billion, taking into account rising cost of control intensity, your portfolio of new products, how should we think about your Process Control Systems growth profile relative to WFE this year? It's clearly going to outperform, but should we expect a similar type of outperformance like you saw in '21 or maybe even better, just given the customer mix and the complexity challenges? And is it going to again be led by wafer inspection? \nRichard Wallace: Harlan. Good question. Yes, '21, we feel really good about how we performed in '21. I think we talked about several times, just the strength, especially of optical wafer inspection was extraordinary in the year. And also, when we look to our order book, we got tremendous interest in those products that we're seeing great opportunities in '22 as well. \n I think that's a favorable mix for the year for '22 and -- based on the success we've had with some of our new products and the way that they're being received by customers, we anticipate that we'll be in a good position to build on our market leadership position as we go forward. \n So we are anticipating continued growth in share, albeit at the kind of rate that we outlined a few years ago. So I think the combination of those factors plus the continuation of the drive in design roles are all good indicators and good drivers for KLA to outperform, which is what we're forecasting. We never really know at this point in the year, how it's actually going to -- the details of what it's going to look, but we think Process Control is in a great position for '22, and we're in a great position within Process Control. And Bren can add some color to that. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. I think that what we'll see in terms of mix, I would expect foundry logic to grow faster this year than it grew -- or faster than the growth rate in WFE. And as a result of that, that will be a favorable mix. So to Rick's point, I think that, that will be a driver for us. From a share point of view, we feel pretty good about where we are. Certainly, wafer inspection, as you mentioned, has been the biggest driver. It's been the fastest-growing business in the company. We have a very strong position there. I've said many times, I think it might be one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE. \n I would expect to continue to see momentum in that overall market. So as we said in the prepared remarks that we were about -- we thought we were around 46% for semiconductor systems in 2021. It gets the market of 40% or 41%. And then as we look at high teens type growth rates in WFE this year, I would expect we'll have a similar improvement over the market or similar outperform, somewhere in that mid-single-digit range based on how we're looking at it today. \nHarlan Sur: And I appreciate the insights there. And then on the gross margin front, I understand the supply challenges and other logistics-related dynamics that are impacting your shipments here. But relative to your peers, I mean, your gross margins are holding up extremely well, right? I mean you guys are only guiding for roughly a 50 basis point decline sequentially in gross margins here in the March quarter. And it actually looks like that's more mix and volume related, right? And in the midst of all of these potential cost dynamics, you're still guiding full year gross margins to 63%. \n So help us understand the better sustainability of gross margins in this challenging period. I mean, are you guys just passing along exercising some pricing power and just passing along some of these cost to your customers? \nBren Higgins: That's a great question, Harlan, and I'll start and maybe Rick will want to add a few comments here. But our pricing model is really based on pricing to value. It's priced on the value we believe that our tools add to our customers. And so that's ultimately how we price the products. It isn't a cost-based model. It's more of a value-based. You're right, as you look at the March quarter, what's declining is Semiconductor Process Control revenue quarter-to-quarter, we're actually expecting some growth in our EPC business and every quarter service grows. \n So it is a bit of a mix effect and a volume effect on the March quarter. Going forward, we are seeing pressure on costs. We're not implying that we aren't and I've been pretty open with the fact that I think there's 100 basis point headwind related to cost increases as we all know, everything seems to be costing more. \n Labor is costing more and certainly the ramp in investments our customers -- or suppliers are having to make is driving incremental cost into the model but that's factored in. So absent that, I think given the mix expectations we would have moving into '22 with the growth rate of semi PC consistent with what your last question, then we would see margins improve. But we are feeling a little bit of pressure. \n So I think we hold 63%, plus or minus in any given quarter, you'll see a little bit of variability. But at the end of the day, I also think it's just -- it's a reflection of the value that we're adding, I think it's also a reflection of the differentiation that we have across the portfolio in the marketplace. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just one other thing to add to Bren, I mean I think it's really important that we continue to understand the value we're creating for our customers, and we share in that value in our pricing. I think that's the way to think about it. For them, they're very, very motivated to get these products in as soon as they can because the payback is extremely quick. \n What you would probably see in a more normalized -- if you didn't have an environment that was a supply constrained -- with the increase in volume, you'd actually see the cost dynamics go the other way. So I think what Bren talked about the little bit of headwind that we get is because of some of the pricing increases, but it's not much in our overall business. \n But in a historical context, if you went up as much as our revenues have, we would see volume discounting happening with our suppliers, which would bring down some of the costs, and that's not really happening in this environment. But our starting point is really good, and our new products are incredibly well received by our customers. So not only do we like the margin profile, but our customers really want to get the new products. So we're in a pretty good position as it stands right now. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess another gross margin question, if we really drilled down just the process control, you grew gross margins there, 64% in 2020 to 65% in 2021. And I'm cognizant of the fact that there's clearly some challenges near term. But as you think about the mix that you're seeing and the value add that you're bringing, where do you think process control gross margins can go in a more normalized environment once the supply chain normalizes? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, C.J., it's a great question. You're right. We're in the mid-65% range, if you look at the process control segment overall. So as we move into certainly '22, I would expect that to be roughly flat given what we just said, maybe a little bit better, but generally in that range and just given the things we just talked about. A lot of it depends overall on -- you've got the service mix, which service gross margins have improved over time as that business scales, but it is dilutive. \n So in the long run, if service is growing faster than systems, that does put a little bit of pressure on margins. So I think we're pretty comfortable with the levels that they're at. I can see them ticking up. \n We always talk about 60% to 65% type incrementals on our semi process control business. So I would expect to see something consistent with that. But if you're approaching 65% or maybe a little bit higher at the top end of that, you start to hit the ceiling in terms of how high you can go. So I think we're probably in that mid-60s range, maybe creeping up a little bit from there. But I don't see it improving much more than that. \nChristopher Muse: That's helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, can you comment on whether you expect to be constrained in the June quarter? And as we think about kind of second half total revenues versus first half on a calendar basis, should we be thinking kind of low- to mid-double-digit growth half-on-half? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. Certainly, the second half will be stronger than the first half. And look, I think we're all constrained right now in terms of the ability to get parts. What we've provided is our expected probability of all the various issues we're managing in terms of an overall view. \n But given that March will be lower, I would expect sequential growth as we move through the year. And the second half overall for the company, yes, low- to mid-double digits is a reasonable way to think about it. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: I actually wanted to ask the last question in a slightly different way. So as you go into June, so I think you're suggesting about a $200 million impact in the March quarter. Are you able to recognize that $200 million in June? Or is that spread into the back half of the year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Vivek, it will show up in the June quarter. So these are shipments that slipped out and then are in the June quarter. But when you have suppliers that are running at max capacity in a lot of cases, and they have a disruption, I think the making up of that lost time will take some time through the year, right? I don't think that they'll be able to make it all of it once. So there's a little bit of a cascading that happens whenever you have a disruption in a facility that's already running full out, I mean, equipment is running 24/7, people are working up to legal limits in terms of overtime. \n So trying to squeeze more capacity in the short run is a little bit harder. But over time, I would expect that we'll see that creep out. We also expect capacity to improve or have alternatives to materialize as we move through the year. So it's a combination of those effects. But yes, I would expect it to move into the June quarter. \nRichard Wallace: So just one  -- just a little more color to think about. What we saw with Omicron is more people being impacted and losing work days, fortunately not severely impacted, but enough that they had to not be at the workforce. And as Bren said, these factories were ramped up. So it's hard to make that up, but it's also -- they're already coming back. So we have a lot of confidence in the supply chain, returning to more supportive levels for our business going forward. \nVivek Arya: All right. And for my follow-up, I realize it's super, super early, but I was just hoping if you could give us a flavor of customer discussions about 2023? WFE in the past has kind of grown for 2 to 3 years, and there is a period of absorption. This time, we have already had -- or this will be the third year of growth. Do you think it's possible to have a fourth year of growth? And what would be the high-level kind of puts and takes, just so that investors get a sense for is this the peak year for WFE? Or are there still prospects for additional growth next year? \nRichard Wallace: Vivek, great question. I think, ironically, perhaps the current slowdown in our ability as an equipment industry to provide will stretch this out into '23 anyway. And so you see that plus a number of high-profile projects, which have been discussed recently by our customers don't really order equipment in '22 or maybe they place POs, but we certainly don't see deliveries. \n So if you think about some of the big new greenfield projects that have been announced, those are '23 projects, not '22. So I think the combination of those that are related to both support from the regionalization efforts driven by things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S. should that come to pass. But even the other projects, which aren't dependent on that, are really much more about '23 than they are about '22. So as we look at it now, we do have pretty good visibility out through the end of the year and even into the first part of next year for the demand to continue to be very supportive of our business. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Vivek, the only other thing I would add to that is that we have very high levels of backlog. In a lot of cases, we're booking slots for customers into 2023 now. And so as a result of that, we feel pretty confident in the sustainability of what we're seeing. I made some comments earlier about the second half and as we model in terms of how we're planning the company and how we're planning capacity, we expect to see that -- those levels of business sustain as we move forward. So it's a long way out and things can change. \n But certainly, we don't see anything that shows any slowing down anytime in the horizon. And certainly, customers are asking for more and faster. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: I had 2, Bren, one kind of on the same tack as the last question. So it seems like the WFE in the first half of the year were sort of entering March a bit lower than what -- most of us would have thought just because of some of these constraints. But the back half is going to be a lot bigger. If you just take your number, you're going to do like 18 -- I mean, maybe even 19 in terms of process control shipments -- system shipments in the back half of the year. And if you basically take your WFE share, that's like a $110 billion annualized WFE. \n So my question is, when you sort of think about that number and you go back and you try to determine what the demand really supports in terms of WFE, sort of looking at the projects and looking at the technology transitions and what not. How do you handicap sort of -- where you cry uncle on sort of where the WFE run rate becomes too high? And do you agree with the [ 185 ] or somewhere in that range of system number for the back half of the year? \nBren Higgins: Tim, on the last part of your question, given the guidance we gave around second half, you're probably not that far off. It's probably in that 18 range, plus or minus, more or less. So we'll have to see how it plays out. Look, we spent a lot of time looking at the various leading indicators of what we're seeing from customers. And of course, we look at our customers, the discussions we have with them, there is the profitability levels. We look at these end markets and some of the challenges that exist there. \n So as we go through it, you look at our customers are spending more than they ever have. They're more profitable than they've ever been. So we feel pretty good about where they're at and where the demand is. So we're going to -- we'll continue to watch it. But right now, at this point, we -- our customers are continuing to ask for systems. As I said earlier, I think WFE is constrained by supply. And over the long run, we believe that WFE, given rising capital intensity will grow faster than semiconductor revenue in terms of a long run trend. \n So I think that's how we're modeling the company. Certainly, it's how we're planning when we think about supply and investments we need to make. But that's how we're thinking about it right now. \nTimothy Arcuri: And then just maybe a bigger picture, Rick, I'm sort of curious what your view is. I get a lot of questions around as you go to sort of scaling that's a little more verticalized versus using litho to scale, whether you're talking about [indiscernible] or 3D DRAM, things like that. It isn't exactly what happened in NAND, but litho does become a little bit maybe less of a driver for actually to scale going forward. Can you just talk about how you think about how that affects you either positively or negatively sort of in terms of your ability to keep on gaining WFE share? And maybe what you're attach to litho is sort of how you think about that bigger picture? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Tim. Good question. I think that it's interesting if you use the example of NAND as a -- there, you actually went backwards in lithography. And yet the process control intensity, it went down a little bit, but we actually thought it would go down more because what happened was 2 things. And if we'd had solutions, it probably wouldn't have gone down at all because there were other integration problems that we were unable to solve at that time. But even there, it went backwards and there was not a huge change in process control intensity, albeit at lower levels. \n What we're seeing now already in conversations with customers as we look at new device types. The process control challenges are going to be enormous. And many of them, yes, defect is a big part of it, but you have EUV, which is driving additional use cases. You have the registration overlay challenges, which has created quite a significant market, and we also see the need for more and more inspection layers using different wavelengths. So that Gen 4 is being extended. I think we mentioned last quarter, Gen 4 actually outperformed Gen 5 in terms of revenue in 2021. \n And we actually see that continuing because of the usefulness of that product and that wavelength. So we actually think the real question is, are there going to be integration challenges that are going to drive our customers. When there's multiple players competing at the leading edge, that's always a good thing for KLA. I think we went through a period where there was really one main driver, and they had one real end device driving that logic, that's no longer the case. \n So we feel pretty good about the architectures that we're seeing. We have process control teams that are working with our customers. And as far as we can see out through several years, we think we're well positioned with plenty of opportunity and we have a lot of solutions we're investing in, as Bren said, we're investing at a significant level in R&D to be positioned to support those going forward. \n So we don't see really a relaxation in process control intensity as we go forward. Will it continue to rise? We're not anticipating that it goes up a lot. And so that's not in our models, that would be upside to our model if that happened, but that's not what we're working off of. \nBren Higgins: Tim, 2 things. First, when we move from planar to vertical and NAND, if you use NAND as a proxy, we saw a couple of point improvement overall in process control intensity. And it came really in our metrology businesses because if you think you're starting to build the structures vertically, it creates a whole new set of metrology challenges. So we saw an inflection there for metrology and then you also have defect mechanisms related to high-aspect layers -- high-aspect ratio structures and so on. So that is -- if it's a proxy, we feel pretty good about opportunities there as some of the defect mechanisms, and metrology challenges change, but process control intensity overall is a positive. \n Our 2023 plan in terms of process control or KLA share of WFE was to see process control intensity improve, KLA share of WFE to grow about 75 to 100 basis points from 2019. And we feel like we're right on that trajectory as we go forward here. So as Rick said, we don't expect it to grow a lot, but we do expect to see it continuing to grow, and that should create opportunities for us to, for the most part, consistently outgrow the market here over the next few years. \nOperator: We'll move next to Patrick Ho of Stifel. \nPatrick Ho: Rick, maybe just following up on that question by Tim in terms of process control intensity in terms of device architecture. As we look at gate all around, and I know you've talked about it from a big picture perspective of some of the opportunities there. But given the materials intensity, how do you see, I guess, more semiconductor engineering materials type of trends benefiting process control intensity? And especially, I'm just thinking gate all around, the gates now being surrounded by a lot of materials. How do you look at it from both an inspection and probably from an overlay metrology perspective? Do you see one or the other \"benefiting\" from these changes on the materials front? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, Patrick, good question. I think that, again, we've been in conversations with customers about these advanced architectures for some time and the challenges that they face. \n Fortunately, we often have more time than we originally thought to get our solutions ready because these often take longer to get to market than were originally anticipated. So we're actually in pretty good shape in terms of providing solutions for that. Specifically to gate all around, remember, for inspection, there are really a couple of things that we have to -- problems that we have to solve. \n The most significant one often lost on people is it's a contrast question. It's not as much as a resolution as contrast and gate all around with different materials creates a different contrast challenge, which is why the wavelength matters a lot, which is why we're extending Gen 4, and we're seeing good modeling results from that. The other thing that happens, of course, is the registration, every generation, I think, may be lost on people are the additional challenges in registration and overlay every device technology and the increase in sampling is just dramatic in that business and in films in general. \n Again, more challenges associated with that. We have a good modeling effort that goes on very, very strong in the company so we can model and understand what those devices are going to look like and what they're going to need in terms of capability. \n So we're very well positioned to handle that. I think that you're going to see increases in both inspection needs, but also in metrology slightly in different ways. And in metrology, you're already sampling at so many levels. It's more about increasing the sampling at those levels. In other words, more steps or more measurement points per die and per wafer. In inspection, it ends up you add a number of inspection steps in the process as opposed to the area inspected, which is usually already predetermined and that probably won't change. \n So I think that they'll both grow but for different reasons in that. And again, our customers -- our relationship with our customers is such that we've been working on these problems for a while because now they know they need the support of inspection and metrology early in the development phase if they have a chance of ramping these new technologies. So we feel pretty good about our insight into those. \nPatrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up. The current environment obviously is seeing very high utilization across fabs for both leading edge and trailing edge. Given the supply chain issues, and I know not all parts and components are the same for both new systems and \"your spare parts business, your installed base business.\" But how are you balancing some of the procurement issues that you're dealing with today in terms of where do I take this component or parts? Should it go into the spare parts bucket? Or should it go into a new system? How are you balancing that today? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, Patrick, it's a great question and it's something that we spend a lot of time on internally, particularly as Brian Lorig runs our service business points out to me all the time that don't forget about spares. So it is absolutely a balancing act. Fortunately, we have pretty good idea of when things will fail that -- around certain components, and we can plan for that. But we -- in terms of stocking levels. But we're very -- we have had situations where we will pull parts off of systems, if we have to, to support the field, we've made commitment to customers, those customers value these systems, and we've got to keep them up and running. \n So in a lot of those cases, we're going to generally prioritize service if we can't figure out a way to work around it, which we've for the most part been able to do. But it's a constant balancing act, and it's something that we watch very closely. \nOperator: We have time for one last question, and we'll take Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the supply constraints in terms of how much planning were you able to do around it? Did you get surprised by these component issues? And are you generally just kind of meeting commitments to your customers but the lead times are getting pushed out? Or was there kind of a decommitment because of disruptions in your own supply chain? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Joe, that's a great question. So I'll say a couple of things here. First, yes, there were some surprises, right? As we were moving through December and into the early part of January, the COVID impact was a surprise in terms of the impact on some of these suppliers. So we also had some issues that materialized, as I said in the prepared remarks around, I'll call them, more lower-value commodity parts that we also procure in a lot of cases, where those are as we have supplier suppliers that are trying to acquire those parts to then send them to us to our direct suppliers before it gets to us. So it's a little bit harder to have visibility down at those levels. \n Now with enough time, you can typically manage around some of those issues, either by finding alternatives, qualifying alternatives. It does have an impact on on-time delivery, to your point, and so the reason we were able to quantify the impact of 8% to 10% on the results in March was really what we thought we were looking at as we ended the December quarter and where we ended up today. So we had a pretty good visibility to the impact and so we're able to quantify it. On-time delivery is what's suffering though. But we're managing around it to the extent we can. \n And I think customers, while there's tremendous pressure in the system, there's a reality check of the challenges that I think I can speak for everybody that we're all dealing with here. \nKevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, Joe and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We know it's a busy week of earnings, a busy day of earnings. We really appreciate everyone's time and attention. I'm sure we'll be catching up with many of you throughout the quarter. With that I'll pass the call back over to Leo to end the call. \nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Before summarizing KLA's results for calendar year 2021 and for the December quarter, I'd like to first acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. The dedication and hard work of our teams never wavered despite challenging conditions, delivering for customers and managing around a complex global supply chain during a period of unprecedented industry shortages. \n It was the day-to-day drive to be better that drove KLA's market leadership, resulting in record growth and financial performance across the board for the company in the December quarter and for 2021. KLA also delivered record returns to shareholders in 2021 through our dividend and share repurchase programs with returns to shareholders totaling over $2 billion. \n KLA's strong results demonstrate our track record of relative strength and revenue growth and superior financial performance compared with semiconductor industry peers in a dynamic and growing wafer fab equipment industry as well as the long-term value created by employee and consistently refining our KLA operating model. Since our founding in 1976, KLA's mission has been focused on using our expertise and innovative thinking to overcome monumental technological challenges. \n KLA is advancing humanity with technologies and ideas that inspire action. Our results in the December quarter and for 2021, demonstrate ongoing success of these strategies. So thank you to all our teams for contributing to KLA's enduring success. 2021 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow for KLA, as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges in the marketplace, responding to record demand across the vast majority of our markets, while adapting to the evolving operational complexities associated with the global pandemic. \n Through it all, we remained focused on delivering to our customers' requirements and driving strong returns to shareholders in a rapidly growing industry demand environment. In 2021, revenue grew 34% to $8.2 billion, marking the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth. \n KLA's strong revenue growth in 2021 was driven by 46% growth in the semiconductor process control systems. Revenue from the services business grew 14% in the year, with over 75% of the revenue generated from recurring subscription-like contracts, reflecting the growing value of added process control systems and services in our product portfolio. \n KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2021 with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 54% and 61%, respectively. Incremental operating margin on the revenue growth in 2021 was 57%, consistently above our target operating leverage model of 40% to 50% for the second year in a row. \n Free cash flow also grew a healthy 43% in 2021 to a record $2.5 billion. Consistent with our long-term strategic objectives, KLA delivered on our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, including our 12th consecutive dividend increase announced in July 2021, along with an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. \n Total returns to shareholders in 2021, including dividend and share repurchases, topped just over $2 billion or approximately 79% of free cash flow. This growth demonstrates success in strengthening our market leadership across our business that we can continue to build upon to drive adoption of KLA solutions in the critical markets we serve. Within the Electronics, Packaging and Component inspection or EPC Group, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment grew 11% in 2021, and the Printed Circuit Board Display and Component Inspection grew 17% in the year. \n The strong relative performance for KLA reflects our market leadership and diversification and was driven by secular industry growth trends across multiple end markets. We ended 2021 with an exceptionally strong backlog and began what we anticipate being a seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. We enter 2022 executing at a high level and operating from a position of strength in our marketplace despite persistent supply chain challenges. \n This momentum sets the stage for KLA to continue to outperform the market while demonstrating superior financial performance and maintaining our capital returns. Turning now to focus on the December quarter results where we saw diversified strength across our business. Today, demand environment continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of a broad spectrum of semiconductor and electronic industry growth trends. \n Technology is transforming how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, growth in new automotive electronics and strong growth in data centers and 5G communication markets. \n Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control, and growth and expansion in new markets like Specialty Semiconductor Process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasing digital world. \n To make this happen, KLA continues to prioritize and invest in R&D, which totaled $1 billion in calendar 2021, double the level of 5 years ago and growing at a 15% compound annual growth rate. With this favorable backdrop and our demonstrated track record of investing heavily in R&D to drive product differentiation and consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to customers and shareholders, our performance enabled KLA to outperform the 2023 long-term financial model targets that we set 2 years ago, 2 years ahead of expectations. \n Moving along to the top highlights from the December 2021 quarter. First, we saw continued strength and consistency in foundry logic customer revenue for both leading edge and legacy technologies in the December quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew in the period. Calendar 2022 is setting up to be another year of strong growth for WFE. \n We see demand momentum throughout 2022 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. In foundry and logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers, and we expect another year of double-digit growth in 2022 with NAND growing faster than DRAM; second, KLA is seeing strong demand across the breadth of our industry-leading optical inspection portfolio as we have maintained our momentum in one of the fastest-growing markets in WFE. \n Wafer inspection systems revenues grew 54% in 2021, far outpacing the WFE market, which is estimated to have grown 40%. We're experiencing strong growth across our wafer inspection portfolio from broadband plasma, laser scanning, unpatterned bare wafer inspection, macro inspection and e-beam products. \n This quarter, we highlight macro inspection, which is growing at a pace of 1.5x WFE driven by growth in automotive and other specialty markets where KLA has defensible market leadership with a platform uniquely positioned to address growing technical complexity and tighter design rules; third, success in KLA's strategic growth and market diversification strategies are being demonstrated by growth in EPC. \n Systems revenue from KLA's Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, grew 20% in 2021. With EPC, KLA is diversifying our market leadership with a portfolio of solutions addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, including RF, specialty semiconductors, automotive, PCB, advanced packaging and display; fourth, service revenue grew 14% in 2021 to $1.8 billion and continues to sustain a growth rate above its long-term target of 9% to 11%. For the quarter, services revenue was $457 million or 19% of total revenue. Annual services revenue is quickly approaching $2 billion and has grown 81% in the past 3 years. \n This growth has been driven by the rising installed base and increasing adoption of subscription-like contracts. Over 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment, and over 90% of services in the printed circuit board business come from recurring subscription-like contracts. \n Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional one from a free cash flow perspective, capping a year in which KLA generated over $2.5 billion in free cash flow and returned over $2 billion to shareholders. In the December quarter, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, which helped drive 43% growth in free cash flow in 2021. We've also maintained focus on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share repurchase program, which rose 63% year-over-year on a combined basis. \n Before Bren gets into greater detail on our financial highlights and guidance, let me briefly summarize. Despite the persistent disruption and continued challenges associated with the pandemic, particularly around the supply chain and component availability, KLA is consistently delivering strong revenue growth, financial results and returns to shareholders. \n KLA is well positioned at the forefront of technological innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products targeting the most demanding inspection and measurement challenges in the marketplace. I also want to provide a quick update on our ESG activities. On December 16, KLA announced setting a goal to use 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030. Managing the impacts of our business in terms of ESG stewardship is an integral part of KLA's mission to advance humanity. This includes contributing to creating a more sustainable future. \n With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. Bren? John, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel pretty good about how we've navigated through the pandemic. A couple of factors for KLA specific, I think, to think about. One is we were up in the December quarter. And again, huge customer demand, so working to work that off. We talked in the past about securing critical components, critical parts from key suppliers. That actually continues to be in good shape, where we had some challenges in the last few weeks. \n And right now, as we're actually working through them, had to do with not necessarily our critical supply but just generalized supply across the industry. I think as most companies are talking about. So we're seeing some of that, that are not unique, as Bren said in his comments, to KLA. The reason we feel more confident is even in the last few days, we've seen some pressure being released in that system, that it won't be in time for what we would have preferred to ship in this quarter, we obviously have the backlog, we could have shipped more if we'd had it. \n But it's being resolved. So we feel pretty good about the go forward after we get through March. And I'll let Bren add some color since he's spending a good part of his time working some of these issues himself. Harlan. Good question. Yes, '21, we feel really good about how we performed in '21. I think we talked about several times, just the strength, especially of optical wafer inspection was extraordinary in the year. And also, when we look to our order book, we got tremendous interest in those products that we're seeing great opportunities in '22 as well. \n I think that's a favorable mix for the year for '22 and -- based on the success we've had with some of our new products and the way that they're being received by customers, we anticipate that we'll be in a good position to build on our market leadership position as we go forward. \n So we are anticipating continued growth in share, albeit at the kind of rate that we outlined a few years ago. So I think the combination of those factors plus the continuation of the drive in design roles are all good indicators and good drivers for KLA to outperform, which is what we're forecasting. We never really know at this point in the year, how it's actually going to -- the details of what it's going to look, but we think Process Control is in a great position for '22, and we're in a great position within Process Control. And Bren can add some color to that. Yes. Just one other thing to add to Bren, I mean I think it's really important that we continue to understand the value we're creating for our customers, and we share in that value in our pricing. I think that's the way to think about it. For them, they're very, very motivated to get these products in as soon as they can because the payback is extremely quick. \n What you would probably see in a more normalized -- if you didn't have an environment that was a supply constrained -- with the increase in volume, you'd actually see the cost dynamics go the other way. So I think what Bren talked about the little bit of headwind that we get is because of some of the pricing increases, but it's not much in our overall business. \n But in a historical context, if you went up as much as our revenues have, we would see volume discounting happening with our suppliers, which would bring down some of the costs, and that's not really happening in this environment. But our starting point is really good, and our new products are incredibly well received by our customers. So not only do we like the margin profile, but our customers really want to get the new products. So we're in a pretty good position as it stands right now. Yes, C.J., it's a great question. You're right. We're in the mid-65% range, if you look at the process control segment overall. So as we move into certainly '22, I would expect that to be roughly flat given what we just said, maybe a little bit better, but generally in that range and just given the things we just talked about. A lot of it depends overall on -- you've got the service mix, which service gross margins have improved over time as that business scales, but it is dilutive. \n So in the long run, if service is growing faster than systems, that does put a little bit of pressure on margins. So I think we're pretty comfortable with the levels that they're at. I can see them ticking up. \n We always talk about 60% to 65% type incrementals on our semi process control business. So I would expect to see something consistent with that. But if you're approaching 65% or maybe a little bit higher at the top end of that, you start to hit the ceiling in terms of how high you can go. So I think we're probably in that mid-60s range, maybe creeping up a little bit from there. But I don't see it improving much more than that. Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. Certainly, the second half will be stronger than the first half. And look, I think we're all constrained right now in terms of the ability to get parts. What we've provided is our expected probability of all the various issues we're managing in terms of an overall view. \n But given that March will be lower, I would expect sequential growth as we move through the year. And the second half overall for the company, yes, low- to mid-double digits is a reasonable way to think about it. So just one  -- just a little more color to think about. What we saw with Omicron is more people being impacted and losing work days, fortunately not severely impacted, but enough that they had to not be at the workforce. And as Bren said, these factories were ramped up. So it's hard to make that up, but it's also -- they're already coming back. So we have a lot of confidence in the supply chain, returning to more supportive levels for our business going forward. Vivek, great question. I think, ironically, perhaps the current slowdown in our ability as an equipment industry to provide will stretch this out into '23 anyway. And so you see that plus a number of high-profile projects, which have been discussed recently by our customers don't really order equipment in '22 or maybe they place POs, but we certainly don't see deliveries. \n So if you think about some of the big new greenfield projects that have been announced, those are '23 projects, not '22. So I think the combination of those that are related to both support from the regionalization efforts driven by things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S. should that come to pass. But even the other projects, which aren't dependent on that, are really much more about '23 than they are about '22. So as we look at it now, we do have pretty good visibility out through the end of the year and even into the first part of next year for the demand to continue to be very supportive of our business. Yes. Thanks, Tim. Good question. I think that it's interesting if you use the example of NAND as a -- there, you actually went backwards in lithography. And yet the process control intensity, it went down a little bit, but we actually thought it would go down more because what happened was 2 things. And if we'd had solutions, it probably wouldn't have gone down at all because there were other integration problems that we were unable to solve at that time. But even there, it went backwards and there was not a huge change in process control intensity, albeit at lower levels. \n What we're seeing now already in conversations with customers as we look at new device types. The process control challenges are going to be enormous. And many of them, yes, defect is a big part of it, but you have EUV, which is driving additional use cases. You have the registration overlay challenges, which has created quite a significant market, and we also see the need for more and more inspection layers using different wavelengths. So that Gen 4 is being extended. I think we mentioned last quarter, Gen 4 actually outperformed Gen 5 in terms of revenue in 2021. \n And we actually see that continuing because of the usefulness of that product and that wavelength. So we actually think the real question is, are there going to be integration challenges that are going to drive our customers. When there's multiple players competing at the leading edge, that's always a good thing for KLA. I think we went through a period where there was really one main driver, and they had one real end device driving that logic, that's no longer the case. \n So we feel pretty good about the architectures that we're seeing. We have process control teams that are working with our customers. And as far as we can see out through several years, we think we're well positioned with plenty of opportunity and we have a lot of solutions we're investing in, as Bren said, we're investing at a significant level in R&D to be positioned to support those going forward. \n So we don't see really a relaxation in process control intensity as we go forward. Will it continue to rise? We're not anticipating that it goes up a lot. And so that's not in our models, that would be upside to our model if that happened, but that's not what we're working off of. Yes, Patrick, good question. I think that, again, we've been in conversations with customers about these advanced architectures for some time and the challenges that they face. \n Fortunately, we often have more time than we originally thought to get our solutions ready because these often take longer to get to market than were originally anticipated. So we're actually in pretty good shape in terms of providing solutions for that. Specifically to gate all around, remember, for inspection, there are really a couple of things that we have to -- problems that we have to solve. \n The most significant one often lost on people is it's a contrast question. It's not as much as a resolution as contrast and gate all around with different materials creates a different contrast challenge, which is why the wavelength matters a lot, which is why we're extending Gen 4, and we're seeing good modeling results from that. The other thing that happens, of course, is the registration, every generation, I think, may be lost on people are the additional challenges in registration and overlay every device technology and the increase in sampling is just dramatic in that business and in films in general. \n Again, more challenges associated with that. We have a good modeling effort that goes on very, very strong in the company so we can model and understand what those devices are going to look like and what they're going to need in terms of capability. \n So we're very well positioned to handle that. I think that you're going to see increases in both inspection needs, but also in metrology slightly in different ways. And in metrology, you're already sampling at so many levels. It's more about increasing the sampling at those levels. In other words, more steps or more measurement points per die and per wafer. In inspection, it ends up you add a number of inspection steps in the process as opposed to the area inspected, which is usually already predetermined and that probably won't change. \n So I think that they'll both grow but for different reasons in that. And again, our customers -- our relationship with our customers is such that we've been working on these problems for a while because now they know they need the support of inspection and metrology early in the development phase if they have a chance of ramping these new technologies. So we feel pretty good about our insight into those. Yes, Patrick, it's a great question and it's something that we spend a lot of time on internally, particularly as Brian Lorig runs our service business points out to me all the time that don't forget about spares. So it is absolutely a balancing act. Fortunately, we have pretty good idea of when things will fail that -- around certain components, and we can plan for that. But we -- in terms of stocking levels. But we're very -- we have had situations where we will pull parts off of systems, if we have to, to support the field, we've made commitment to customers, those customers value these systems, and we've got to keep them up and running. \n So in a lot of those cases, we're going to generally prioritize service if we can't figure out a way to work around it, which we've for the most part been able to do. But it's a constant balancing act, and it's something that we watch very closely. Yes. Joe, that's a great question. So I'll say a couple of things here. First, yes, there were some surprises, right? As we were moving through December and into the early part of January, the COVID impact was a surprise in terms of the impact on some of these suppliers. So we also had some issues that materialized, as I said in the prepared remarks around, I'll call them, more lower-value commodity parts that we also procure in a lot of cases, where those are as we have supplier suppliers that are trying to acquire those parts to then send them to us to our direct suppliers before it gets to us. So it's a little bit harder to have visibility down at those levels. \n Now with enough time, you can typically manage around some of those issues, either by finding alternatives, qualifying alternatives. It does have an impact on on-time delivery, to your point, and so the reason we were able to quantify the impact of 8% to 10% on the results in March was really what we thought we were looking at as we ended the December quarter and where we ended up today. So we had a pretty good visibility to the impact and so we're able to quantify it. On-time delivery is what's suffering though. But we're managing around it to the extent we can. \n And I think customers, while there's tremendous pressure in the system, there's a reality check of the challenges that I think I can speak for everybody that we're all dealing with here."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA's December quarter and 2021 results highlight the continuation of strong execution in a dynamic and challenging market environment. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. \n The December quarter capped off a year in 2021 that was defined by strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. We also invested almost $1 billion in R&D to sustain our success and $250 million in capital expenditures to grow our global infrastructure to support our industry growth thesis. All this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. \n Total revenue in the December quarter was $2.35 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of $2.225 billion to $2.425 billion and up 13% sequentially versus the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.1%, just above the midpoint of the guided range of 62% to 64%. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.71 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.59, each within the guidance range. \n Gross margins were 63.1% and in line with expectations as product mix and factory expenses ended the quarter mostly as planned. KLA's gross margin reflects the value we deliver to the marketplace and our competitive differentiation. To improve on our ability to meet our customer needs, we are also making meaningful investments in our global workforce, supply chain and factory infrastructure to position KLA to deliver our products in this growing demand environment. \n Total non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly below the midpoint of the guided range of $465 million, including $265 million of R&D expense and $200 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was 43.4% in the December quarter. KLA's innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. \n R&D is at the heart of what we do and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy, new product introduction cadence and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model, as well as new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. \n Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and within outsourced partners. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $495 million in the March quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. \n While operating expenses are modeled higher going forward as we will make the necessary investments to scale our business to support our long-term structural industry growth thesis, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. \n Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $39 million, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.3%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it remains prudent to maintain our long-term tax planning rate at 13.5% going forward. \n Non-GAAP net income was $851 million. GAAP net income was $717 million. Cash flow from operations was $811 million, and free cash flow was $746 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 88% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of 32%. The company had approximately 152 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding exiting the quarter. \n Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $2.05 billion, up 49% compared with the December 2020 quarter and up 15% sequentially. Semiconductor Process Control systems and service grew 39% in calendar '21 versus calendar 2020. \n Foundry logic was 71% of the approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix in the December quarter and memory was 29%. Within memory, the business was split roughly 54% DRAM and 46% NAND. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging and Components Group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. \n More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business generated record revenue of $113 million, up 24% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. Specialty Semiconductor Process systems and service grew 11% for calendar '21. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $188 million, up 5% year-over-year, but down 7% sequentially. On a full calendar year basis, it grew 17%. \n Our breakdown of revenue by major products and region can be found in the shareholder letter, so I won't cover those here. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of 70% or more of free cash flow generated. \n In 2021, KLA exceeded our long-term capital returns target, returning over $2 billion to shareholders, including $601 million in dividends paid and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. \n KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the December quarter, we repurchased $430 million of common stock and paid $160 million in dividends. \n As we begin the new year, our view is that the WFE market will grow in the high teens, topping $100 billion off a baseline of approximately $86 billion for 2021. WFE demand is still constrained by the industry's ability to supply. Strong industry growth momentum in 2022 across all end markets is expected to drive growth with the strongest percentage growth coming from foundry logic customers. And memory investment will be led by 3D NAND. \n Now wrapping up with our outlook and guidance. Looking ahead, our backlog remains strong and sales funnel visibility over the near-term horizon is good. However, rising product lead times driven by increased supply chain constraints is limiting our near-term output. These issues are reducing our revenue expectation by 8% to 10% for the March quarter. \n Specifically, COVID-related disruptions at a number of single-source suppliers have exacerbated what has already been a difficult supply situation where these suppliers have been challenged to meet demand by running their production at max capacity. These disruptions are causing delays in parts delivery timing across multiple product platforms. In addition, numerous electronic component sourcing challenges have become more acute over the past month as these are standardized parts and in demand across multiple industries. \n We expect that the COVID-related impact will begin to abate shortly and new capacity or supply alternatives are expected to become available as we move through the calendar year. While these issues can be fluid and difficult to predict in the short run, we expect the March quarter revenue to represent the low point for calendar 2022, and we remain exceedingly confident in the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. \n Given current expectations for growth in WFE and other electronics markets, we feel confident in our ability to grow throughout the year with total company revenue growth exceeding 20% and semiconductor process control systems revenue to outperform WFE growth again. Our confidence is based on current backlog levels, competitive positioning, strong customer engagement, and steps we continue to take to add capacity to address output constraints in what continues to be a robust demand environment. \n Our March quarter 2022 guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 59% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue. \n Memory is expected to be approximately 41%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as overall revenue levels declined modestly on a sequential basis and product mix dilutes gross margins by roughly 50 basis points versus the prior quarter. To provide some color for the calendar year, given higher revenue volume, product mix expectations across our various segments offset by expected cost pressures within our supply chain, we are modeling gross margins to be approximately 63% for the year, plus or minus 50 basis points. \n Other model assumptions for the March quarter include operating expenses of approximately $495 million, interest and other expense of approximately $41 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.54, plus or minus $0.45, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.80 plus or minus $0.45. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 151 million shares. In conclusion, we have exceptionally strong and diversified end market dynamics propelling semiconductors and the essential WFE investments required to make them. \n Furthermore, we are seeing revenue growth opportunities as more innovation occurs and technology complexity increases in specialty semiconductors, advanced packaging and other electronics markets. Finally, our services offerings continue to deliver more value to our customers in our Semiconductor Process Control business, and their evolving opportunities to further expand our value proposition in our acquired businesses. Our record backlog is supported by solid customer demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. \n 2022 is setting up to be the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for WFE and the seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. The KLA operating model fuels KLA's strategic objectives and positions us to outperform the industry in terms of growth and financial performance. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. \n They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat and strong record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Hey John, how are you? So just to add to Rick's comments. I think one of the things you have to consider is most of our strategic buffer that we've built, whether we have it in inventory levels at the company, whether it's at inventory or long lead time materials that we've either procured or suppliers have procured. Over the last 15 months or so, given the strength of demand, we have worked through a fair amount of that. And that's one of the challenges we have is we are more dependent today on the predictability of timing, first of all, but also volume of quality. And so I think those are issues that we continue to work through. As Rick said, in our complex systems, we generally have a pretty transparent view of where that demand is, although everyone is struggling to meet the demand environment that we're facing today. \n But it's in our higher volume but single sourced type products where we've seen some of these pressures. We did not anticipate a COVID variant and what that would do to those factories in terms of people having to leave either because of contact or exposure. So you had facilities that are already running 100% max that all of a sudden had to deal with this disruption in a lot of cases, a pretty meaningful disruption in the first part of the month. \n We think that, that's abating. And we're getting a sense that that's improving. And this COVID environment, we'll have to figure out and navigate our way through. We don't know what the future holds. But at least in terms of the near-term environment, we feel pretty good about that. \n And then trying to source and find all the electrical components, which are deeper in our build of material and within our supply chain. There's less visibility, but there's also alternative, either alternative supplies, qualifying new parts in some cases, leveraging third parties, which we've been doing, and that's even becoming more challenged in terms of distributors and others that might be out there that have those parts. \n So we're managing through this. We're escalating where appropriate. And as we look at it and walk through what we expect to see moving forward, we think the March quarter sets up as the bottom, and we expect -- given the guidance we gave that we would see growth through the year and expect the company to be somewhere in excess of 20%, as we said in the prepared remarks. So there's always some questions or unpredictability here in terms of just where things are, but that's the best of how we see it today. Yes. No, you're thinking about it right. As we see revenue growth, it should accelerate to the higher end of the range. The commentary was really about how we look and size the company on an annual basis or over a longer-term horizon. And if you look at '19 to our '22 planning, we will have had incremental operating margins given the growth we've seen in excess of 50%, about 52%. So my point was that we would expect revenue to grow. We're also expecting OpEx to grow. But at the end of the day, as we're sizing 2022, we expect to be in our target range of 40 to 50. Yes, Harlan. I think that what we'll see in terms of mix, I would expect foundry logic to grow faster this year than it grew -- or faster than the growth rate in WFE. And as a result of that, that will be a favorable mix. So to Rick's point, I think that, that will be a driver for us. From a share point of view, we feel pretty good about where we are. Certainly, wafer inspection, as you mentioned, has been the biggest driver. It's been the fastest-growing business in the company. We have a very strong position there. I've said many times, I think it might be one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE. \n I would expect to continue to see momentum in that overall market. So as we said in the prepared remarks that we were about -- we thought we were around 46% for semiconductor systems in 2021. It gets the market of 40% or 41%. And then as we look at high teens type growth rates in WFE this year, I would expect we'll have a similar improvement over the market or similar outperform, somewhere in that mid-single-digit range based on how we're looking at it today. That's a great question, Harlan, and I'll start and maybe Rick will want to add a few comments here. But our pricing model is really based on pricing to value. It's priced on the value we believe that our tools add to our customers. And so that's ultimately how we price the products. It isn't a cost-based model. It's more of a value-based. You're right, as you look at the March quarter, what's declining is Semiconductor Process Control revenue quarter-to-quarter, we're actually expecting some growth in our EPC business and every quarter service grows. \n So it is a bit of a mix effect and a volume effect on the March quarter. Going forward, we are seeing pressure on costs. We're not implying that we aren't and I've been pretty open with the fact that I think there's 100 basis point headwind related to cost increases as we all know, everything seems to be costing more. \n Labor is costing more and certainly the ramp in investments our customers -- or suppliers are having to make is driving incremental cost into the model but that's factored in. So absent that, I think given the mix expectations we would have moving into '22 with the growth rate of semi PC consistent with what your last question, then we would see margins improve. But we are feeling a little bit of pressure. \n So I think we hold 63%, plus or minus in any given quarter, you'll see a little bit of variability. But at the end of the day, I also think it's just -- it's a reflection of the value that we're adding, I think it's also a reflection of the differentiation that we have across the portfolio in the marketplace. Yes. Vivek, it will show up in the June quarter. So these are shipments that slipped out and then are in the June quarter. But when you have suppliers that are running at max capacity in a lot of cases, and they have a disruption, I think the making up of that lost time will take some time through the year, right? I don't think that they'll be able to make it all of it once. So there's a little bit of a cascading that happens whenever you have a disruption in a facility that's already running full out, I mean, equipment is running 24/7, people are working up to legal limits in terms of overtime. \n So trying to squeeze more capacity in the short run is a little bit harder. But over time, I would expect that we'll see that creep out. We also expect capacity to improve or have alternatives to materialize as we move through the year. So it's a combination of those effects. But yes, I would expect it to move into the June quarter. Yes. Vivek, the only other thing I would add to that is that we have very high levels of backlog. In a lot of cases, we're booking slots for customers into 2023 now. And so as a result of that, we feel pretty confident in the sustainability of what we're seeing. I made some comments earlier about the second half and as we model in terms of how we're planning the company and how we're planning capacity, we expect to see that -- those levels of business sustain as we move forward. So it's a long way out and things can change. \n But certainly, we don't see anything that shows any slowing down anytime in the horizon. And certainly, customers are asking for more and faster. Tim, on the last part of your question, given the guidance we gave around second half, you're probably not that far off. It's probably in that 18 range, plus or minus, more or less. So we'll have to see how it plays out. Look, we spent a lot of time looking at the various leading indicators of what we're seeing from customers. And of course, we look at our customers, the discussions we have with them, there is the profitability levels. We look at these end markets and some of the challenges that exist there. \n So as we go through it, you look at our customers are spending more than they ever have. They're more profitable than they've ever been. So we feel pretty good about where they're at and where the demand is. So we're going to -- we'll continue to watch it. But right now, at this point, we -- our customers are continuing to ask for systems. As I said earlier, I think WFE is constrained by supply. And over the long run, we believe that WFE, given rising capital intensity will grow faster than semiconductor revenue in terms of a long run trend. \n So I think that's how we're modeling the company. Certainly, it's how we're planning when we think about supply and investments we need to make. But that's how we're thinking about it right now. Tim, 2 things. First, when we move from planar to vertical and NAND, if you use NAND as a proxy, we saw a couple of point improvement overall in process control intensity. And it came really in our metrology businesses because if you think you're starting to build the structures vertically, it creates a whole new set of metrology challenges. So we saw an inflection there for metrology and then you also have defect mechanisms related to high-aspect layers -- high-aspect ratio structures and so on. So that is -- if it's a proxy, we feel pretty good about opportunities there as some of the defect mechanisms, and metrology challenges change, but process control intensity overall is a positive. \n Our 2023 plan in terms of process control or KLA share of WFE was to see process control intensity improve, KLA share of WFE to grow about 75 to 100 basis points from 2019. And we feel like we're right on that trajectory as we go forward here. So as Rick said, we don't expect it to grow a lot, but we do expect to see it continuing to grow, and that should create opportunities for us to, for the most part, consistently outgrow the market here over the next few years."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\n And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q1 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the September quarter and the outlook for the December quarter. With me on today's call is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2021, released this afternoon after market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. \n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. And whenever we make references to a year, we are referring to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. \n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. \n Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. \n During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. \n Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. \n Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. \n Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. \n For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. \n KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. \n Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. \n In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. \n Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. \n Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. \n Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. \n In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. \n We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. \n We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. \n With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. \n Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. \n Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. \n GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. \n Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. \n Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. \n While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. \n Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. \n The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. \n Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. \n Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. \n PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. \n Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. \n For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. \n Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. \n KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. \n Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. \n While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. \n Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. \n In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. \n KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Ashley, can you please queue up for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Congratulations on the solid results and outlook. Rick, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your optimism around the NAND market, whether it's the December guide specifically where it's moving up as a mix or in your prepared comments, you said that next calendar year is setting up for a strong year in NAND. To what extent is that just being driven by technology transitions that might be a little bit more insulated from the overall market conditions in the NAND market overall? \nRichard Wallace: John, yes, thanks. It is -- for us, it is more driven by technology transitions than overall capacity. As you know, mostly, that's what drives the early adoption of our leading technologies. And what we're seeing with NAND is, NAND is as the design rules or the complexity continues, we're seeing a larger adoption of process control. As you know, the design rules aren't as advanced in NAND as they are as DRAM, but they're getting more challenging. And so that's driving larger amount of inspection requirement but also quite a bit in metrology as well. So it's really both. \nBren Higgins: John, it's Bren. I mean it is picking up off of pretty low levels, right? And I think overall, if you look at the growth of the year for the market, the NAND market grew considerably. It was growing but considerably slower than the overall market. So there's some optimism there in terms of we are seeing some tick up, although the percentage is, as I said, the absolute value is not a lot. And I think as we move into the first part of '22. I think we'll see a little bit more investment there. \nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren, just going back to your commentary around OpEx, it makes sense given the opportunity ahead of you that you guys are making the investments. I'm wondering if you can just put some guardrails on growing sequentially every quarter from that $470 million level. Where might the exit trajectory be next year? And I guess, is there any flexibility around a revenue environment that might become a little bit more volatile in the second half of the year? \nBren Higgins: It's a great question, John. And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. \n So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. \n I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. \n Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. \n So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess a similar question on the gross margin side. As you think about your investments that you're making now, how should we think about the trajectory for gross margins into calendar '22? And I guess as part of that, would love to know mix-wise, what would enable you to hit the higher end or 64% in the December quarter as well? \nBren Higgins: Yes, C.J., one of the challenges, all the things I mentioned, that there is a COGS component to it. And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. \n Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. \n But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter. \nChristopher Muse: That's very helpful. As a follow-up, on the revenue guide for first half calendar '22, that implies roughly, I think, $50 million higher each quarter. And so curious, is there any seasonal impact we should be thinking about Orbotech lower in the March quarter? And otherwise, should we be thinking about really process control being the key driver of that uplift? \nBren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. Right now, and again, things could change, but I don't see any seasonal impact into the first quarter. I think Process Control will be above, obviously, the high single-digit commentary. So I think we'll see process control systems higher than that in terms of the first half expectations. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: On the first one, the industry is about to start making this transition to 3-nanometer. And I was hoping you could contrast what that move means for Process Control intensity, right, the move from 5 to 3 versus the change you saw when the industry moved from 7 to 5? And can this transition from 5 to 3 change the competitive landscape in any way? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I think -- yes, I think the -- it's a more similar change, I think, as traditional ones because EUV has already been introduced. So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. \n So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. \n Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. \n So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. \n But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time. \nBren Higgins: Vivek, I could also say that in N5, you're going to have a lot of -- a high number of design starts. So you're going to see customers adding capacity in N5, which means it's much harder for them to try to migrate any of that capacity to N3. So they're going to be investing in N3, but also adding capacity in N5. So the technical drivers make that harder already based on a lot of the things that Rick just talked about, but also the design start activity, will also be a factor in that. So there's a lot of new capacity that comes in to support that node. \nVivek Arya: Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, at the risk of pushing you a little more on the calendar '22 because you were so nice to give us what you're seeing in the first half. Usually, the second half of the year -- calendar year tends to be better than the first half. So to the extent that you have visibility, right, today based on bookings and whatnot, is there any factor that could prevent that from happening next year? \nBren Higgins: Look, I'm not going to guide the second half, it's pretty far out. Yes, we have seen that phenomenon over the last couple of years play out. I would say in part of why we felt comfortable with the first half guidance is that we do have very high levels of backlog. And given the fact that the WFE number this year is clearly a supply number and not a demand number, there's certainly evidence of visibility through our customers and how they're lining up tools into the first half of the year. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we see there, hence, the guidance we provided and are driving the business and in particular, the capacity we have to be able to support long-term growth in the industry. So I'm not going to give you the second half, but I don't see any reason why things would fall off given the nature of what we're seeing and the demand and conversations we have from customers. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I had 2 of them. First one, Ric or Bren, it looks like your China sales have been really strong. And when I look at the industry, it looks like both you and your peers are all getting demand from a long tail of smaller customers, many of them are focused on things like IoT. So I'm kind of curious what is the split between MNC and domestic? And how durable do you think the China business from these smaller customers who seem to have cropped up recently and maybe don't have the scale, how durable do you think it is? And then I have a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Well, just in terms of overall percentages, I would say our Semi Process Control is pretty consistent with the overall this quarter for the company. Sometimes EPC tends to be heavier weighted to China and does pull the overall company up a little bit. But this quarter, it's pretty close. It does tend to be lumpier. So I think overall, if you look at the business, we probably expect overall China to be somewhere around in the low 20s as a percent for calendar year '21. Above that, I would say, 15% or so, maybe 20% is multinational. So 80% of that would be native. \nBren Higgins: And the second part of that, when it comes to sustainability, these are, to your point, they're smaller scale, but they're also lagging in terms of when people would think about leading-edge technologies. They're not leading edge, they're supporting domestic demand. And if you think about the EV industry, for example, the car, there's quite a bit of activity in China around that. So they're trying to have more control over their own supply chain for those trailing edge parts. So it's actually quite sustainable when you look at the amount of demand there is for specialty semiconductors in the China market. So I think that that's something that you'll continue to see, and it's a long way away from some of the concerns people have about leading edge in China. \nRichard Wallace: I guess the final point on that also is that when you think about our business, we do have exposure to wafer into mask. And so if you look at what's going on in terms of domestic capacity for infrastructure to support the semiconductor business, we do have some exposure to that overall. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Super helpful, Rick and Bren. And then a quick follow-up. Just wanted to see what is the status on the e-beam tools? I remember last quarter, it was about 15 or so tools in the field. Can you give us a status update on that? And where do you think your market share is today on e-beams? \nBren Higgins: Well, I don't know if things have changed all that much. I mean, certainly, we're confident in the product road map that we have for e-beam. And I think it's complementary with our optical tools. Now when we say e-beam, it's a broad term. It covers not just metrology but also inspection and review. So there's a lot of efforts that are happening across the company, including in reticle inspection. \n But we -- our strategy around EBI, which is I think you're referring to, inspection, is really to try to leverage and use the EBI technology and the machine learning that we have to drive the inspectors and add more value or more relevancy to the inspection tools. So it's more of a portfolio strategy than a point product strategy. And I think it's going pretty consistent with our overall expectations today. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I would just add to that. I think the team has done an outstanding job of developing this capability and delivering it. We're getting very positive feedback from our customers. They really like the idea of some of the capabilities. They also like the leverage that we have between some of the algorithms we've developed in our other systems that they're familiar with being able to apply those to e-beam and also as Bren said the interoperability. \n So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it. And there are actually some expansion opportunities in things like some of the increased demands of overlay that require more people are looking at for e-beam in order to control the very advanced design rules. \n So it's meeting what we plan. We're happy with our execution and the market share is climbing, but it's a long haul to gain share in many of these markets, and we know that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could just talk about the mix this year in foundry logic seems to have shifted more to the legacy nodes a little bit or at least those are stronger than they've been. Can you talk about maybe where that mix is? I think you've given that sort of qualitative color on that in the past. And what does that do for KLA? Does that sort of a headwind for you relative to WFE? Or -- and if that rolls off, could it help you the other direction? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. No, it's interesting this year. I think last year it was a little bit more heavy in trailing edge. In '21, it's been very leading edge-centric for our business. And I think '22 probably expands a little bit more in terms of the trailing edge. So it's about 20% to 25% of our foundry revenue, I'd classify as below 28-nanometer. And so I'd call that leading edge. And so 28 and above is about 25% or so. So 75% is below 28. And I think as we go into next year, I think we'll see a little bit more of the trailing edge activities. \nBren Higgins: One of the things that it's done for us, I mean, versus, I think, if you go back long enough, we have a Gen 5 and Gen 4 we talked about in detail. We also have different variants of BBP, which are even more suitable to some of the lower end. And those customers often are familiar with the higher-end tools, and they want some of that capability. So we're seeing that these products actually run a little bit longer than they ever had. \n And so we have another product we call the C205, which is targeted for the auto industry, and we're able to sell that, and we're seeing that it really leverages a lot of the R&D that we've done for years. \n So the platform, even -- we talked about a portfolio of products, but the truth is we have a portfolio of BBP products. And it is not just across the different technologies, it's one technology across the different generations. And we're really leveraging that. So what's really surprising when we look at it is that Gen 5, while it's doing quite well, it's actually one of the smaller -- relative to the Gen 4, it's significantly smaller in dollar volume this year, and that will grow over time, which makes us feel really good about the sustainability and the overall potential for us to continue to be able to invest and provide capability for our customers across all nodes. So it's pretty exciting to see. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: You talked about the increase in your manufacturing capacity, but how do we think about the ability of your supplier partners capacity to grow in order to support your growth, given some of your components, I know are several months for lead times? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It's a great question, Joe. When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. \n So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. \n So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. \n We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. \n And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. And let me just add one perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years inextricably linked to them. \n So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. \n So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you talked about increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. I was curious if you could double-click on that. And maybe also how do we think about that from a margin profile, just given it seems like maybe some of those opportunities are maybe a little bit more hands on? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I'll take the first part, and Bren can speak to the margin opportunity. I think that, as you well know, a lot of these fabs are running a lot longer than historically, some of them have relied on some version of third party or their own service. As those factories have been upgraded with more recent KLA technology, it's really been falling on us to support that. So I give you the example of the C205 product line. That's not something that they're going to be able to readily get a third party to service or do it themselves or just wait. So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition. \n The other factor, of course, that is helpful is they're all quite profitable enterprises for our customers, so they're willing to make that investment to secure their capabilities. \nBren Higgins: I don't think the margins are any different than other parts of the service business that we have. And look, we serve to an entitlement. We serve to what our customers purchase a certain service level, and we optimize the organization to be able to support that. Certainly, the utilization rates are higher, and so that's creating a revenue stream also the demand on that capacity in terms of not just incremental volume but also demands in terms of reliability is also increasing. And so that's creating opportunities for us to sell more capability, but also to introduce some of our newer products that have road maps and have the ability to have an upgrade stream to it. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: I guess, Bren, you gave guidance first half versus the second half of this year for the whole company. But it seems like Process Control Systems could be up like low teens first half of next year versus the second half of this year. Is that a reasonable number? \nBren Higgins: So I said high single digits, and I would think that Process Control systems based on what we seek to do today, will be higher than the company average. \nTimothy Arcuri: Higher than the company average. Okay. Got it. \nBren Higgins: Yes. So if it's 8-ish percent, I expect it to be higher. High single digits, right, 8%, 9% or whatever that is. So... \nTimothy Arcuri: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then on EPC, so I know that the long-term outlook is for EPC to grow double digits, but you're growing more than 20% this year, and that's kind of even before the big packaging stuff from the big guy who has this huge project has even really hit your orders yet. So can you just talk about the timing of that? And do you think that you can grow double digit next year even off this elevated level? And maybe when do you expect that big project to start to positively impact your EPC business? \nBren Higgins: We would expect growth next year in EPC. I'm not going to get into specific sizing overall, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing here for next year. And I don't want to get into specific timing for customers. We're pretty optimistic about the opportunities that exist there and some of the product offerings that we have. So we'll have to see it play through, but I am encouraged to think it's another year of growth. I think EPC will have solid growth into next year. \nRichard Wallace: So yes, Tim, just to give a little more color on that. I do think if you thought about these big programs, they're pretty early stages. So I think by the time that it will result in significant accelerant to that growth were in 2023. So it's not really -- 2022, I think, rises with some of the industry and programs and partnerships that we already have, '23 is a result of some of the newer things that are being worked on now. And I've mentioned before and we've talked, we are very excited about what we're hearing and seeing in terms of both the opportunity and the desire for these bigger players to engage with KLA. So -- but that's not as much a '22 as it is a '23 phenomenon. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. \nPatrick Ho: Congrats on a nice quarter. Rick, maybe first off, on a big picture basis, you're seeing a lot of changes in the DRAM industry right now from a process technology standpoint as you go to 1z and 1a. From a process control intensity standpoint, it's likely to increase. What are the biggest process challenges that you're helping customers address? Is it in new materials? Is it the deeper VS? And maybe if you could give a little color of the applications that are driving increasing intensity in DRAM. \nRichard Wallace: I think the biggest thing for what we're seeing in DRAM, and this was a question, I think, for quite a while, was EUV going to be simply for advanced logic devices, advanced foundry. And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. \n And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. \n So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. \n Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. \n And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity. \nPatrick Ho: Great. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Bren. You guys have been posting really strong services revenues, which is not a surprise. Do you believe any of this incremental pickup in services is related to, I guess the shortage situation with chips, it's driving probably higher utilization rates and probably the need to keep these tools running. Do you feel like any of this incremental pickup in services is related to the current market situation involved with semiconductors? \nBren Higgins: Sure, sure. That's driving the higher utilization rates. So that's certainly a factor. One of the -- also the large factors you're starting to see tools that were shipped in '20 as we've seen that the systems business grow and ramp that those tools are coming out of warranty now as we move into the second half of '21. And so that is also a driver of incremental service revenue. \n I think that contract penetration has been good in this environment. Customers rely on us to keep their capacity up. And so we've also seen some incremental benefit of -- from a contract renewal point of view. So I think there's a number of factors that are driving it. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick follow-up for the team. Your December quarter revenue implies a wide range, up 7% to 16%. I would like to hear what are the key variables that would drive the low end versus the high end. \nBren Higgins: Mehdi, it's Bren. So our typical revenue guidance range is plus or minus $100 million. And typically for that, it tends for us to be more about, look, we have very large integer tools. We can have systems that can cost upwards of $40 million apiece. And so at times, depending on dynamics around supply chain, the dynamics around customer readiness and in some cases, you have to go to customer accepting -- their customer acceptance. So there are always those factors that influence our -- where we could land in a certain range. \n So our range has been very consistent over the last several quarters. I don't think anything's really changed on that front. It really gets down to our assessment of where we're at. In some cases, we have evaluations, consignments that have to be bought out. So there's always some fluidity to our expectations in our revenue plan as we build it up. But I wouldn't say that there's any one issue or another that is driving how we're thinking about the overall range. \nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. That's fair. And then one quick follow-up on WFE. Given your view on the first half of calendar year '22, it seems to me that your share gain could be in the 50 to 100 basis point, and you're not providing absolute dollar value of WFE. But if I just take your commentary, it seems like a minimum of 50 basis point share gain is actually very conservative. Do you have anything you can share with me? \nBren Higgins: Well, we feel very good about the relative performance this year and to our prepared remarks, also next year. When we were at our Investor Day in New York back in 2019, we laid out a plan that we thought that would drive KLA's share of WFE up 75 to 100 basis points between 2019 and 2023. Part of that was market share gain, part of it we thought were intensity opportunities related to the introduction of some new products. So we feel pretty good about the trajectory we're on. \n I don't want to provide a specific number there. But our goal is to hit our plan, and I feel pretty good about where we are relative to that plan. \nKevin Kessel: Operator, we have time, it looks like, for one last question. \nOperator: Okay. Our final question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. [ EVG ] adoption continues at a pretty aggressive pace in using mass layer accounts continue to expand with every new technology node. And then additionally, you have the one large logic customer that is now back on an aggressive technology cadence, leveraging EV. So how are you guys thinking about the growth of your reticle inspection business relative to overall Process Control for this year? And how are you thinking about reticle inspection growth into next year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. When I look at reticle inspection, I think it's a market growth kind of number this year, probably will be a record for us this year. And -- but I think on a go-forward basis, you're right, the introduction of EUV and increasing layer counts are driving growth in that overall market. As you know, we support that market with multiple products that help optimize for our customers to optimize around some of the technology challenges but also the economic objectives that they have. \n So I do think that there's an inflection in that market. We've seen nice performance this year, and we expect to see it continue to grow over the next few years. \nHarlan Sur: Yes. I appreciate that. And then one of the big growth drivers for next year in terms of WFE is more of these mature and specialty nodes and you guys talked a bit about it. But I think the team actually did recently introduce 4 or 5 new tools which are primarily focused on mature and specialty inspection and metrology, like the C205 broadband plasma inspection platform. Can you guys just give us a sense of early adoption curve? What's the differentiation of these tools versus customers just buying like refurbished older-generation KLA tools? \nRichard Wallace: Sure, Harlan. I mean I think that there was, I think, historically, a view of trying to leverage the older technology. But as you can imagine, those tools are quite aged at this point. So we definitely saw a step-up, plus it was harder for us to service it. So we're seeing a lot more capability we can offer now in some of these -- and I'd say the C205 is like a derivative tool of the BBP tool. So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. \n And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment. \n What we laid out at the Investment Day, 100 years ago, it feels like 2019, we're still on track, actually ahead of plan for that in terms of automotive. And we anticipated bringing on some of these products at that time. \nHarlan Sur: And I assume that you're getting, what higher dollar capture value for these new tools relative to, let's say, purchasing a refurbished tool? \nRichard Wallace: Oh, much higher. And I think it's just -- it's a better deal, frankly, for everybody. I mean the capability of the software, they can do more with them. We can service them more effectively, have a longer life. I think, a lot of upside for them to do that. In fact, in many of these older fabs, this might be the one area where they are bringing in new capability. \nKevin Kessel: And thank you, everybody, for your time. This will conclude the call. I'll pass it back to the operator for any final instructions. \nOperator: And this concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you for joining us today. KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. \n During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. \n Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. \n Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. \n Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. \n For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. \n KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. \n Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. \n In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. \n Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. \n Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. \n Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. \n In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. \n We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. \n We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. \n With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. John, yes, thanks. It is -- for us, it is more driven by technology transitions than overall capacity. As you know, mostly, that's what drives the early adoption of our leading technologies. And what we're seeing with NAND is, NAND is as the design rules or the complexity continues, we're seeing a larger adoption of process control. As you know, the design rules aren't as advanced in NAND as they are as DRAM, but they're getting more challenging. And so that's driving larger amount of inspection requirement but also quite a bit in metrology as well. So it's really both. Well, I think -- yes, I think the -- it's a more similar change, I think, as traditional ones because EUV has already been introduced. So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. \n So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. \n Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. \n So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. \n But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time. Well, just in terms of overall percentages, I would say our Semi Process Control is pretty consistent with the overall this quarter for the company. Sometimes EPC tends to be heavier weighted to China and does pull the overall company up a little bit. But this quarter, it's pretty close. It does tend to be lumpier. So I think overall, if you look at the business, we probably expect overall China to be somewhere around in the low 20s as a percent for calendar year '21. Above that, I would say, 15% or so, maybe 20% is multinational. So 80% of that would be native. I guess the final point on that also is that when you think about our business, we do have exposure to wafer into mask. And so if you look at what's going on in terms of domestic capacity for infrastructure to support the semiconductor business, we do have some exposure to that overall. Yes. I would just add to that. I think the team has done an outstanding job of developing this capability and delivering it. We're getting very positive feedback from our customers. They really like the idea of some of the capabilities. They also like the leverage that we have between some of the algorithms we've developed in our other systems that they're familiar with being able to apply those to e-beam and also as Bren said the interoperability. \n So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it. And there are actually some expansion opportunities in things like some of the increased demands of overlay that require more people are looking at for e-beam in order to control the very advanced design rules. \n So it's meeting what we plan. We're happy with our execution and the market share is climbing, but it's a long haul to gain share in many of these markets, and we know that. Yes. No, it's interesting this year. I think last year it was a little bit more heavy in trailing edge. In '21, it's been very leading edge-centric for our business. And I think '22 probably expands a little bit more in terms of the trailing edge. So it's about 20% to 25% of our foundry revenue, I'd classify as below 28-nanometer. And so I'd call that leading edge. And so 28 and above is about 25% or so. So 75% is below 28. And I think as we go into next year, I think we'll see a little bit more of the trailing edge activities. Yes. And let me just add one perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years inextricably linked to them. \n So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. \n So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things. Well, I'll take the first part, and Bren can speak to the margin opportunity. I think that, as you well know, a lot of these fabs are running a lot longer than historically, some of them have relied on some version of third party or their own service. As those factories have been upgraded with more recent KLA technology, it's really been falling on us to support that. So I give you the example of the C205 product line. That's not something that they're going to be able to readily get a third party to service or do it themselves or just wait. So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition. \n The other factor, of course, that is helpful is they're all quite profitable enterprises for our customers, so they're willing to make that investment to secure their capabilities. So yes, Tim, just to give a little more color on that. I do think if you thought about these big programs, they're pretty early stages. So I think by the time that it will result in significant accelerant to that growth were in 2023. So it's not really -- 2022, I think, rises with some of the industry and programs and partnerships that we already have, '23 is a result of some of the newer things that are being worked on now. And I've mentioned before and we've talked, we are very excited about what we're hearing and seeing in terms of both the opportunity and the desire for these bigger players to engage with KLA. So -- but that's not as much a '22 as it is a '23 phenomenon. I think the biggest thing for what we're seeing in DRAM, and this was a question, I think, for quite a while, was EUV going to be simply for advanced logic devices, advanced foundry. And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. \n And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. \n So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. \n Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. \n And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity. Sure, Harlan. I mean I think that there was, I think, historically, a view of trying to leverage the older technology. But as you can imagine, those tools are quite aged at this point. So we definitely saw a step-up, plus it was harder for us to service it. So we're seeing a lot more capability we can offer now in some of these -- and I'd say the C205 is like a derivative tool of the BBP tool. So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. \n And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment. \n What we laid out at the Investment Day, 100 years ago, it feels like 2019, we're still on track, actually ahead of plan for that in terms of automotive. And we anticipated bringing on some of these products at that time. Oh, much higher. And I think it's just -- it's a better deal, frankly, for everybody. I mean the capability of the software, they can do more with them. We can service them more effectively, have a longer life. I think, a lot of upside for them to do that. In fact, in many of these older fabs, this might be the one area where they are bringing in new capability."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. \n Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. \n Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. \n GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. \n Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. \n Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. \n While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. \n Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. \n The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. \n Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. \n Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. \n PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. \n Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. \n Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. \n For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. \n Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. \n KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. \n Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. \n While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. \n Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. \n In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. \n KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. John, it's Bren. I mean it is picking up off of pretty low levels, right? And I think overall, if you look at the growth of the year for the market, the NAND market grew considerably. It was growing but considerably slower than the overall market. So there's some optimism there in terms of we are seeing some tick up, although the percentage is, as I said, the absolute value is not a lot. And I think as we move into the first part of '22. I think we'll see a little bit more investment there. It's a great question, John. And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. \n So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. \n I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. \n Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. \n So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps. Yes, C.J., one of the challenges, all the things I mentioned, that there is a COGS component to it. And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. \n Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. \n But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter. Yes, it's a good question. Right now, and again, things could change, but I don't see any seasonal impact into the first quarter. I think Process Control will be above, obviously, the high single-digit commentary. So I think we'll see process control systems higher than that in terms of the first half expectations. Vivek, I could also say that in N5, you're going to have a lot of -- a high number of design starts. So you're going to see customers adding capacity in N5, which means it's much harder for them to try to migrate any of that capacity to N3. So they're going to be investing in N3, but also adding capacity in N5. So the technical drivers make that harder already based on a lot of the things that Rick just talked about, but also the design start activity, will also be a factor in that. So there's a lot of new capacity that comes in to support that node. Look, I'm not going to guide the second half, it's pretty far out. Yes, we have seen that phenomenon over the last couple of years play out. I would say in part of why we felt comfortable with the first half guidance is that we do have very high levels of backlog. And given the fact that the WFE number this year is clearly a supply number and not a demand number, there's certainly evidence of visibility through our customers and how they're lining up tools into the first half of the year. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we see there, hence, the guidance we provided and are driving the business and in particular, the capacity we have to be able to support long-term growth in the industry. So I'm not going to give you the second half, but I don't see any reason why things would fall off given the nature of what we're seeing and the demand and conversations we have from customers. And the second part of that, when it comes to sustainability, these are, to your point, they're smaller scale, but they're also lagging in terms of when people would think about leading-edge technologies. They're not leading edge, they're supporting domestic demand. And if you think about the EV industry, for example, the car, there's quite a bit of activity in China around that. So they're trying to have more control over their own supply chain for those trailing edge parts. So it's actually quite sustainable when you look at the amount of demand there is for specialty semiconductors in the China market. So I think that that's something that you'll continue to see, and it's a long way away from some of the concerns people have about leading edge in China. Well, I don't know if things have changed all that much. I mean, certainly, we're confident in the product road map that we have for e-beam. And I think it's complementary with our optical tools. Now when we say e-beam, it's a broad term. It covers not just metrology but also inspection and review. So there's a lot of efforts that are happening across the company, including in reticle inspection. \n But we -- our strategy around EBI, which is I think you're referring to, inspection, is really to try to leverage and use the EBI technology and the machine learning that we have to drive the inspectors and add more value or more relevancy to the inspection tools. So it's more of a portfolio strategy than a point product strategy. And I think it's going pretty consistent with our overall expectations today. One of the things that it's done for us, I mean, versus, I think, if you go back long enough, we have a Gen 5 and Gen 4 we talked about in detail. We also have different variants of BBP, which are even more suitable to some of the lower end. And those customers often are familiar with the higher-end tools, and they want some of that capability. So we're seeing that these products actually run a little bit longer than they ever had. \n And so we have another product we call the C205, which is targeted for the auto industry, and we're able to sell that, and we're seeing that it really leverages a lot of the R&D that we've done for years. \n So the platform, even -- we talked about a portfolio of products, but the truth is we have a portfolio of BBP products. And it is not just across the different technologies, it's one technology across the different generations. And we're really leveraging that. So what's really surprising when we look at it is that Gen 5, while it's doing quite well, it's actually one of the smaller -- relative to the Gen 4, it's significantly smaller in dollar volume this year, and that will grow over time, which makes us feel really good about the sustainability and the overall potential for us to continue to be able to invest and provide capability for our customers across all nodes. So it's pretty exciting to see. Yes. It's a great question, Joe. When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. \n So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. \n So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. \n We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. \n And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today. I don't think the margins are any different than other parts of the service business that we have. And look, we serve to an entitlement. We serve to what our customers purchase a certain service level, and we optimize the organization to be able to support that. Certainly, the utilization rates are higher, and so that's creating a revenue stream also the demand on that capacity in terms of not just incremental volume but also demands in terms of reliability is also increasing. And so that's creating opportunities for us to sell more capability, but also to introduce some of our newer products that have road maps and have the ability to have an upgrade stream to it. So I said high single digits, and I would think that Process Control systems based on what we seek to do today, will be higher than the company average. Yes. So if it's 8-ish percent, I expect it to be higher. High single digits, right, 8%, 9% or whatever that is. So... We would expect growth next year in EPC. I'm not going to get into specific sizing overall, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing here for next year. And I don't want to get into specific timing for customers. We're pretty optimistic about the opportunities that exist there and some of the product offerings that we have. So we'll have to see it play through, but I am encouraged to think it's another year of growth. I think EPC will have solid growth into next year. Sure, sure. That's driving the higher utilization rates. So that's certainly a factor. One of the -- also the large factors you're starting to see tools that were shipped in '20 as we've seen that the systems business grow and ramp that those tools are coming out of warranty now as we move into the second half of '21. And so that is also a driver of incremental service revenue. \n I think that contract penetration has been good in this environment. Customers rely on us to keep their capacity up. And so we've also seen some incremental benefit of -- from a contract renewal point of view. So I think there's a number of factors that are driving it. Mehdi, it's Bren. So our typical revenue guidance range is plus or minus $100 million. And typically for that, it tends for us to be more about, look, we have very large integer tools. We can have systems that can cost upwards of $40 million apiece. And so at times, depending on dynamics around supply chain, the dynamics around customer readiness and in some cases, you have to go to customer accepting -- their customer acceptance. So there are always those factors that influence our -- where we could land in a certain range. \n So our range has been very consistent over the last several quarters. I don't think anything's really changed on that front. It really gets down to our assessment of where we're at. In some cases, we have evaluations, consignments that have to be bought out. So there's always some fluidity to our expectations in our revenue plan as we build it up. But I wouldn't say that there's any one issue or another that is driving how we're thinking about the overall range. Well, we feel very good about the relative performance this year and to our prepared remarks, also next year. When we were at our Investor Day in New York back in 2019, we laid out a plan that we thought that would drive KLA's share of WFE up 75 to 100 basis points between 2019 and 2023. Part of that was market share gain, part of it we thought were intensity opportunities related to the introduction of some new products. So we feel pretty good about the trajectory we're on. \n I don't want to provide a specific number there. But our goal is to hit our plan, and I feel pretty good about where we are relative to that plan. Yes. When I look at reticle inspection, I think it's a market growth kind of number this year, probably will be a record for us this year. And -- but I think on a go-forward basis, you're right, the introduction of EUV and increasing layer counts are driving growth in that overall market. As you know, we support that market with multiple products that help optimize for our customers to optimize around some of the technology challenges but also the economic objectives that they have. \n So I do think that there's an inflection in that market. We've seen nice performance this year, and we expect to see it continue to grow over the next few years."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the June 2023 quarter and our September quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close, along with supplemental materials that are all available on our IR website. \n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. \n Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. \n Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. \n Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. \n KLA's June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. \n GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges. As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries. \n Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase when faster time to yield is critical. \n KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership in process control, which includes some of the most critical and fastest-growing segments of WFE.  \n Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and reticle infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA. For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. \n The KLA Services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements. \n I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 billion to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix as upside in the quarter was driven by higher-margin products, normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjusts to current demand expectations. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised $314 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense net was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%. With the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower or $5.33. \n Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million, GAAP net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million and free cash flow was $880 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119% and free cash flow margin was 37%. \n The company had approximately 137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; debt of $5.89 billion; and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. \n Turning to our outlook. Our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business and we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year. \n Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%; foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall, with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes. \n KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. \n In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. \n Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70% and memory is expected to be around 30% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND at 10%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%.  \n Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully-diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares. \n In conclusion, we continue to see process controls' importance to technology transitions and advancements key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. \n As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023. Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling. \n Broadening semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have at lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n While a global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. Per the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. \n Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide instructions and queue for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the strength that you're seeing in your blank wafer business. How do you see that looking into next year? And is there a risk of maybe some digestion after a pretty strong investment cycle there? \nBren Higgins: Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply. It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical. \n  But the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers takes some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand. They're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging techniques that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well. \n So as we look at this year, it's going to continue to grow this year, expect it to do well. And then -- but I do think as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys saw some pretty, I think, significant upside to your memory kind of expectations or at least relative to what you were thinking 3 months ago, and particularly around DRAM. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what drove that in the quarter? \nBren Higgins: Sure. We had some movement across a number of our customers, and the number overall is, frankly, pretty low. But that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to 1 of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, can you update us on where optical inspection lead times are? And given the importance of that tool set for R&D lines, is that something that you expect will sustain at elevated levels? Or do you think that should normalize over time? \nRichard Wallace: C.J., it's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through, as far as we can see, into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing. So we expect that to remain elevated and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24 and beyond, we'll see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time. \nRichard Wallace: One of the nice -- we talked about in the past, C.J., is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5. And Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in places that we didn't necessarily forecast, like automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, encouraging to see your Semi Services business grow sequentially. Can you kind of comment on how you see that playing out in the second half? And what kind of potentially negative impact are you seeing from lower utilization from your memory customers? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. We're very pleased with the performance in Services. And it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see Services utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization, asking us to back off a little bit. \n And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what had been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading-edge logic/foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard. But it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the Services business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I chose -- the first one, Rick, obviously, you have like very strong revenues from China. There's been some chatter that the U.S. might expand export controls, even maybe mature nodes. I know right now, you're capped at 14-nanometer and below for foundry/logic. Is there any commentary you can give on that? And how to think about it, like, let's say, for example, 14 goes to 28, the restriction, or 28 goes to 40. Is there a way to quantify the impact to your sales? And then I have a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, I won't speculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really, we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. \n Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China is legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick. And then as a follow-up, based on the numbers, it looks like you're going to outperform WFE again this year, and you do this last couple of years. The last couple of years, it is more -- some of your peers were supply chain constrained while you were not. And this year, obviously, there's a lot of technology buys. \n I'm just wondering, as we head into next year or the next couple of years, as WFE starts rebounding, is there a risk that some of the fabs already bought process control equipment, that you could actually underperform WFE? \nRichard Wallace: Well, so I would say that we were supply-constrained, but for a different reason. We couldn't -- we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we managed our supply chain, but we still had gaps. \n It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up. I mean 1 thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing play out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and on more layers and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control and that's really what we're experiencing. \n So when we talked about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out, is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the -- we stick to the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: Congrats on the good results. A few of your peers have talked about fab readiness being impacting their shipment this year, especially for EUV tools. Is that something that you already kind of factored in your WFE outlook you gave a quarter ago, when you also said foundry/logic would be down 10%, which you reiterate today? Or are there some other offsets that you would point out that kind of offset that? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It's -- it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so while there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. \n But it's something that we had already made adjustments for. I think it tends to -- usually, shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively -- eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. \nSidney Ho: Okay. Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, speaking of China, I know the revenue is now back to the 30% level. You talked about some of the shipments that came in a little earlier. But I want to ask a little bit different angle. It's clear that there is a big push for self-sufficiency in China, but certain tool sets are harder to replace than others. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on the competitive dynamics there, that some of your process control clients could be satisfied by domestic companies? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, our market share continues to be strong. I mean we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, restarted some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive, really, at all price points in terms of -- so we feel while there is more competition at trailing edge, we're very well positioned to be able to win. \n And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So we feel good about our ability to compete against any competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So this is not unique, that we would have competition in China. \nBren Higgins: And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So we can -- we can offer lots of solutions to our customers. To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even deconfigured versions of more recent tools. \n And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements, either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: I guess understanding again that memory investment in general is reduced, and it sounds like the China memory shipment might have hit there in the June quarter, but if I were to assume that some of your DRAM activity in coming quarters will be more geared toward DDR5 and applications for high-performance, high-density DRAM for data center and AI applications, are you noticing or anticipating a higher level of process control intensity for that kind of spend? \nBren Higgins: Well look, for more advanced -- for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and reticle fidelity. That's been a driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years. And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see it. \n I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year. But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to see a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments. Now we will participate in process node development, as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. \nBrian Chin: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader follow-up question. Obviously, there's some underutilization of capacity at the leading foundries, more advanced FinFET nodes. And this might just be a cyclical phenomena, but in your conversations with them, do you detect any changes in how they might elect to deploy capital in support of multiple advanced nodes differently? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I mean they've slowed down. I mean for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So I think that's been the main one. What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we've had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. \n The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced node and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing, but I think that the slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that looks pretty good as we get the next few quarters behind us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, can you give the purchase obligation number? I think it was about $12 billion last quarter. I assume it came down a smidge and book-to-bill is still less than 1. And then also, can you tell us how much is sitting outside of 12 months, that number? \nBren Higgins: So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than 1. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to $11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it, which we deliver beyond the 12-month window. \nTimothy Arcuri: Cool. And then, Bren, just for the top guide for December, it sounds like process control system shipments are pretty flat. It looks like maybe EPC should be up a smidge because you had said before that EPC would be about -- down about 20% for the year. So is that right? And I guess part of that was that you had said last call that maybe the process control shipments in December depended on a couple of projects. So sort of what's the -- what are the puts and takes on process control shipments in December? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I don't want to get specific on guiding December. But certainly, consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward. And obviously, that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. \n And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments. That being said, Services continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter, just like it generally always has, as the installed base continues to grow over time, and so we see growth in Services. \n EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile. So I -- I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see -- it's a good indicator given its short lead time, it's more capacity-centric, it's closer to consumer. So it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover, because it weakened earlier, and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the Semi PC part of it. \n And then so Semi PC I think will generally be somewhat consistent with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter. \n Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year, we'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December. And so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame, we're -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Maybe as a follow-up to Tim's question, your prior view was for process control to be down roughly kind of mid-teens, right, relative to WFE, which was down 20%. Now off of the better June quarter results and if I flatline stabilize that process control for the remainder of the calendar year after the June quarter, it looks like your process control franchise is actually going to be down only 10% to 12% for the full year. So even better outperformance versus WFE. \n You mentioned mask inspection, bare wafer, strong dynamics. Like what other product segments are driving the better implied outlook for process control? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about bare wafer obviously being a strong driver, optical inspection. Reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. \n So we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there. Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control intensity there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. \nHarlan Sur: I appreciate that. Is that advanced packaging demand is kicking off quite strongly, right, driven by all these accelerated compute workloads like AI, right? You have HBM, CoWoS packaging, multichip stack-die configuration. TSMC, Intel, all the memory guys, the old stacks, right, you guys supplying to all of them. Are you seeing the demand pick up for your solutions for accelerated compute applications? And is the advanced packaging segment growing this year for the team? Or is that sort of AI accelerated compute demand being somewhat offset by some of the more consumer-focused end markets? \nRichard Wallace: Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase -- there haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small -- relatively small number as a percent. It's got up quite a bit, but off of a small number. \n So absolutely, we've seen it and we see that directly tie to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and combining some of the products we have, Semi Process Control and EPC, we absolutely have seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that. \nBren Higgins: Yes, you had the overall packaging market down, what, 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are occurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: I have a question on leading-edge logic investments. At SEMICON West a couple of weeks ago, when you spoke to suppliers, there were expectations that the leading-edge spending could be up less than mature nodes into next year. \n And I assume process control intensity is higher on leading versus mature nodes. So my question to you is, are there any major product cycles or e-beam or X-ray or major contribution from areas like auto, which could help perhaps offset your exposure to leading-edge investments next year? \nRichard Wallace: Sure. I think that for KLA, the 1 thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. \n So I think that's 1 factor. And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that, less so than one who is primarily focused on capacity would be. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you very much, Chelsea, and I wanted to thank everyone again for their interest and their time. We know it's a very busy earnings season. It's also a very busy day. This was a later call in order to try to accommodate as much as we could. So we look forward to speaking to all of you in the weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for any final remarks. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. \n KLA's June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. \n GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges. As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries. \n Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase when faster time to yield is critical. \n KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership in process control, which includes some of the most critical and fastest-growing segments of WFE.  \n Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and reticle infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA. For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. \n The KLA Services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements. \n I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? C.J., it's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through, as far as we can see, into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing. So we expect that to remain elevated and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. One of the nice -- we talked about in the past, C.J., is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5. And Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in places that we didn't necessarily forecast, like automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. Yes. We're very pleased with the performance in Services. And it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see Services utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization, asking us to back off a little bit. \n And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what had been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading-edge logic/foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard. But it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the Services business. Yes, I won't speculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really, we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. \n Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China is legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. Well, so I would say that we were supply-constrained, but for a different reason. We couldn't -- we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we managed our supply chain, but we still had gaps. \n It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up. I mean 1 thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing play out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and on more layers and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control and that's really what we're experiencing. \n So when we talked about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out, is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the -- we stick to the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. Yes, our market share continues to be strong. I mean we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, restarted some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive, really, at all price points in terms of -- so we feel while there is more competition at trailing edge, we're very well positioned to be able to win. \n And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So we feel good about our ability to compete against any competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So this is not unique, that we would have competition in China. Well, I mean they've slowed down. I mean for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So I think that's been the main one. What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we've had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. \n The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced node and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing, but I think that the slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that looks pretty good as we get the next few quarters behind us. Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase -- there haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small -- relatively small number as a percent. It's got up quite a bit, but off of a small number. \n So absolutely, we've seen it and we see that directly tie to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and combining some of the products we have, Semi Process Control and EPC, we absolutely have seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that. Sure. I think that for KLA, the 1 thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. \n So I think that's 1 factor. And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that, less so than one who is primarily focused on capacity would be."

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 billion to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix as upside in the quarter was driven by higher-margin products, normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjusts to current demand expectations. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised $314 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense net was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%. With the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower or $5.33. \n Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million, GAAP net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million and free cash flow was $880 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119% and free cash flow margin was 37%. \n The company had approximately 137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; debt of $5.89 billion; and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. \n Turning to our outlook. Our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business and we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year. \n Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%; foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall, with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes. \n KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. \n In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. \n Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70% and memory is expected to be around 30% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND at 10%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%.  \n Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully-diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares. \n In conclusion, we continue to see process controls' importance to technology transitions and advancements key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. \n As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023. Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling. \n Broadening semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have at lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n While a global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. Per the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. \n Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply. It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical. \n  But the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers takes some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand. They're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging techniques that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well. \n So as we look at this year, it's going to continue to grow this year, expect it to do well. And then -- but I do think as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. Sure. We had some movement across a number of our customers, and the number overall is, frankly, pretty low. But that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to 1 of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. Yes. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24 and beyond, we'll see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time. Yes. It's -- it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so while there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. \n But it's something that we had already made adjustments for. I think it tends to -- usually, shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively -- eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So we can -- we can offer lots of solutions to our customers. To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even deconfigured versions of more recent tools. \n And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements, either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else. Well look, for more advanced -- for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and reticle fidelity. That's been a driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years. And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see it. \n I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year. But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to see a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments. Now we will participate in process node development, as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than 1. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to $11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it, which we deliver beyond the 12-month window. Yes. I don't want to get specific on guiding December. But certainly, consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward. And obviously, that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. \n And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments. That being said, Services continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter, just like it generally always has, as the installed base continues to grow over time, and so we see growth in Services. \n EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile. So I -- I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see -- it's a good indicator given its short lead time, it's more capacity-centric, it's closer to consumer. So it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover, because it weakened earlier, and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the Semi PC part of it. \n And then so Semi PC I think will generally be somewhat consistent with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter. \n Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year, we'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December. And so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame, we're -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about bare wafer obviously being a strong driver, optical inspection. Reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. \n So we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there. Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control intensity there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. Yes, you had the overall packaging market down, what, 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are occurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the March 2023 quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market closed. All materials can be found on our IR website.\n Today's discussion is being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they are for calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and linked to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our commentary is subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets.\n Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong.\n Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth. Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical. We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter.\n Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest-growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment. \n Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where 0-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test efforts.\n As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. \n We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023. In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses. \n And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow. Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends.\n Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49, above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8% at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to effect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.\n [indiscernible] also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.\n Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million.\n As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow.\n Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar '23 from approximately $95 million in '22. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business.\n We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the U.S. government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded. Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide.\n Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply in light of demand. We expect foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.\n Our June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million; Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and Memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix.\n Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar '23 with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments.\n As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar '23, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60.\n EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares. In conclusion, after 3 years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar '23. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar '22.\n Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.\n For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.\n With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A, and then begin the Q&A? \nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: And great to see you had another year of strong share gains from the team last year. You reiterated your full year WFE outlook at down 20%. You also talked about your process control business remaining stable at the June quarter levels through the remainder of this year. I'm wondering if the stable outlook also reflects the stabilization of cancellation and pushout activity from what I assume has been a pretty volatile bookings environment over the past 6 months? \nBren Higgins: Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.\n So that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than 1, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. \nHarlan Sur: Perfect. And then on your EPC franchise, this -- it's driven pretty strong growth, right, 10% to 11% CAGR over the past 3 years, that's including Services. It even grew 7% last year, right, in a slower consumer environment. Coming into this year, though, you guys are already driving an EPC systems profile of down about 20% year-over-year. Do you still anticipate the EPC business to grow this to outperform WFE growth? And sort of at a high level, how are you thinking about EPC profile second half versus first half? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half. And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.\n But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses. SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year.\n It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, surprised you haven't changed your foundry WFE outlook for 2023 at all. Many of your peers discussed modest adjustments there. So would love to hear your thoughts as to what's offsetting that? And as part of that, can you speak to the lead times for optical inspection, which I still think are well beyond 12 months? So is that the kind of the key to the story for KLA where you're finding this sustainable level at the June level in the second half? \nBren Higgins: Yes, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. \nChristopher Muse: Great. And then maybe just to follow up on the legacy part. You talked about native China being 25% of process control. How much of that is silicon wafer versus just traditional front-end equipment? \nBren Higgins: So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing [indiscernible] on optical inspection. You asked about lead times of our -- on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question. So lead times are -- on optical inspection are still pretty long.\n There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in and down, WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year given those dynamics. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: I'm curious what's giving you the confidence that sales have bottomed when many of your memory customers still appear to have a lot of inventory and are unclear when the utilization will pick up. So specifically, how is your visibility to the memory demand for the back half of this calendar year? Do you think it will be about this level, it'll be lower, above this level?\n Because I noticed that in June, the implied memory sales seem to be picking up, albeit of small numbers. So just any comments on how you're thinking about memory demand recovery from here as it pertains to what you think about utilization at your key memory customers. \nBren Higgins: Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, sort of the 23% that we talked about in June and -- even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations.\n And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend. We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology. So even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And from my follow-up, I realize it's early, but I thought that given that you have long lead times and you are engaged in the technology side with many customers, you probably have a decent view of how the calendar '24 might look like. So I'm not asking for numerical guidance, but what's your gut right now that is WFE likely to grow next year? Is it supposed to be flat or down? Like what could be, just the kind of qualitative puts and takes as we start thinking about WFE next year? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part. And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. \n And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year. So if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar '24, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: The first one, Rick or Bren, you spoke about resuming some shipments to China. Can you quantify in terms of millions of dollars, how much that you're going to expect to recoup in the second half? And is that baked into your view that revenue will stay around these levels into the calendar second half? And along the same path, this China shipment assumption is tied to kind of lagging as memory, and I'm kind of curious, what exactly you mean by lagging as memory because I thought memory is always at leading edge. And then I have a follow-up. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall. So look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up, should we still expect your service revenues to grow this year? And how to think about the service between the Semi and the EPC portion? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. \n And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we've talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yes, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. \nBren Higgins: Yes. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some [indiscernible] capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%. As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. \n But still growth, to Rick's point. And on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Just a first of clarification. For the clarification on export restrictions that you received, that $200 million you're thinking about for the second half of this year, did that reenter your backlog or RPO this quarter? \nBren Higgins: Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we have certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin side, how should we think about inventory reserves for the rest of this year? And then can you just remind us how do we think about the timing of those reversals? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in '21 and '22 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in '21 and '22 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. \n So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply. So what I would expect, well, in this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendibility and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts.\n It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment. So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand.\n But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: I have 2 questions on China. First, is the number of customers you're engaged domestically in China on trailing edge higher this year versus last year or year before? \nRichard Wallace: I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. \nBren Higgins: I mean, I -- but yes, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. \nAtif Malik: Okay. And then on multinational companies in China, Rick, in your discussions with these companies, how are they looking at their future capacity expansions given that the license period for the export restrictions is coming due in September, October? I mean, how are they looking strategically on investments in China? \nBren Higgins: Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's -- they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there -- they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I had 2. So first, I'm just trying to tie your process control systems commentary to WFE. And it sounds like Orbotech systems -- I mean, you're not exclusively saying this in June, but it sounds kind of like they're pretty flattish. So Process Control Systems have to be about [ $1,550 million ], down maybe $175 million from March. And then in the shareholder letter, you're saying that it's going to sort of remain flat into the back half of the year at that level.\n So if I just take the [ $1,720 million ] you did in March and then I take the [ $1,550 million ] in June and I kind of flatline that, and I used $75 billion this year in WFE, that implies you're like 8.5% this year for WFE share, that's -- I mean, that's a record high. So I guess the question is, is there something structural going on that you think there's staying power to where your WFE share could stay that high? Usually, I think, 6% in the trough and 8% in the peak, but you're sort of like 8.5%? Or maybe is it that your $75 billion numbers too low? \nBren Higgins: Tim, I'm not -- we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now. In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at '23 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. \n Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest-growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us. Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point. I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers.\n And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well. So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market. \n Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has, I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms. \n And those 2 -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. \nTimothy Arcuri: And then I guess I had a question also on WFE. And some people are trying to get at this, I think. But -- so WFE is still sort of flat in the $75 billion range. I think, Bren, you said that there's $200 million for you that can shift that sort of an add-back of stuff that was banned in the past. So if you're less than 10% of WFE, that's probably like a few billion dollar add back from just from China there, and then there's all this lagging edge stuff happening in China. \n So is it that the lagging edge kind of stuff -- like it's not helping this year? It's more helping next year? I guess I'm a little surprised that the $75 billion number is not higher just given the massive increase in bookings that we're seeing from lagging edge in China? \nBren Higgins: Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one. We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right?\n We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: I want to follow up with the previous question about -- you talked about the stabilizing demand and maybe a similar profile for the rest of the year. Are you expecting your revenue for the back half of the year to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of that $200 million of recoup revenue? Or are there other factors to consider whether it's on the service business on the EPC side of things? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid-single digit given that guidance. \n And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. \nSidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is one of your largest customers in Taiwan talked about higher levels of tool reuse between the 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers. How is this factored into your second half outlook and maybe even the longer-term outlook? And do you think that's anything incremental to what the industry's current level of capacity is used between those? \nRichard Wallace: It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. \n So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So nothing really new in what we see in those statements. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I had a follow-up question to Sidney's question. Given the depth and breadth of design start activity you're seeing in the leading edge foundry space. What are your expectations for process control intensity into 2024? Is there a bias potentially to the upside from where you are in 2023? \nBren Higgins: Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows. It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. \n You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling but also more layers here moving forward. So those are all positives for us. Also depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. \n So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well. So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market as it relates to foundry/logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. \nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I think you commented specifically on China as it pertains to your business with wafer suppliers and reticle suppliers as well. But curious on a global basis, how big are those businesses today? And how should we think about sustainability over the next 12 months or so, again, on the wafer side as well as both merchant and captive reticle customers? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall wafer -- and I'm separating this way because I don't want to double count. But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. \n And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: You talked about kind of qualitatively about Services not being down this year, maybe up a little bit this year. Can you talk about the utilization impact on that? And as you see utilizations coming down in both foundry and memory, I guess I would think that has less impact on you than it does for some of the other guys. But can you just talk to how utilization might weigh on that number? \nBren Higgins: The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the Service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment. \n So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. \nJoseph Moore: That's helpful. And then separately, on China, you guys have talked to the sort of China trailing-edge logic opportunity a couple of different times here. Your sense for whether there's building ahead there -- I mean I would assume you have customers there that have anxiety about future export controls, could they be putting in capacity? I guess maybe a different way of asking the question, do you see utilization that kind of validates the requirement of the spending? Or do you worry that it could be a building ahead of supply? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. It's possible. I mean we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies. Remember, there's a very active EV market in China.\n So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. \nBlayne Curtis: I was curious, I mean, you talked about in the outlook, legacy growing faster than leading edge. Just curious if you could give us a perspective where that mix is within foundry/logic today? And maybe a perspective of where it's come from? \nBren Higgins: Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging, so to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter. And it's broad-based. And certainly, China is a pretty big factor in and all, but you also have a fair amount of revenue growth, the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these end markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge. \n And our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots. So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last 6 months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. \nBlayne Curtis: And then I wanted to ask you on the inventories on the balance sheet. I think it's a record level -- near record in data as well. So I guess kind of everybody has this phenomena going on. How are you thinking about managing that with the top line kind of flat to down? I'm kind of curious if inventories will still grow and any impact on gross margin as you work it down? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. \n As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them. And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of Service extendibility of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. \n So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much. That's why even in these very strong upturn environments, we've rarely gotten above -- much above 2x from an inventory term point of view. \n So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Maybe for Rick, trailing edge clearly is sort of less process control intensive. But I guess to what extent does the immaturity of these production lines, particularly in China, a lot of greenfield situations and also the desire for faster time to market, how do these factors kind of counteract that typical kind of lower intensity for trailing edge? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's 1 thing. The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have -- you get more efficiency on a large fab.\n And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result. They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. \n So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. \nBrian Chin: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of the percent of memory increasing in the June quarter -- and it looks like also on a dollar basis as well, I think you suggested it's pretty focused towards DRAM. Can you characterize the nature of that uptick? Or is this more of a kind of a classic case of coming off such lows in March that this is really more of a bouncing along a bottom kind of situation? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology-centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities we get early. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Just 2 follow-ups for me. If I just take your commentary regarding the revenue trend first half and second half of the calendar, it seems to me that the peak to trough decline in revenues in the 25% to 30% range. And I'm not asking you for a guide. But what I wanted to better understand if you did close to $3 billion in December of '22 with a WFE in the $90 billion to $95 billion. Can you go and hit those revenue run rate without WFE -- if not WFE having to go to $90 billion? Does your diversification looking forward, especially with semiconductor material and others, would enable you to hit [ $3 billion ] without having WFE to go to $90 billion plus? And I have a follow-up. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things -- and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue with lower WFE levels as that sustains. Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. \n There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there. So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in 1 year. We talked a lot about 0.5 point to 1 point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. \n And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/logic in terms of overall mix of WFE, that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then just 1 quick follow-up. If any of your customers were to reuse some of the equipment, how should we think about price diagnostic content for that application? \nBren Higgins: Well, as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others. It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. \n But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities. But I am sure they will look for opportunities. If in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. \n You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So those tend to be longer-term decisions. So structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer-term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment.\n What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online. And given the design start environment at 7 and 5, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward. \nKevin Kessel: And thank you, everyone, for your time today for -- we know it's busy earnings season. I appreciate it. We'll be seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chelsea, so she can provide any final instructions. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets.\n Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong.\n Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth. Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical. We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter.\n Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest-growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment. \n Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where 0-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test efforts.\n As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. \n We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023. In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses. \n And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow. Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends.\n Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology. So even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part. And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. \n And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year. So if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar '24, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. Yes, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. \n And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we've talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yes, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms. \n And those 2 -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. \n So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So nothing really new in what we see in those statements. Yes. It's possible. I mean we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies. Remember, there's a very active EV market in China.\n So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. Yes. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. \n As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them. And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of Service extendibility of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. \n So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much. That's why even in these very strong upturn environments, we've rarely gotten above -- much above 2x from an inventory term point of view. \n So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's 1 thing. The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have -- you get more efficiency on a large fab.\n And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result. They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. \n So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology-centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities we get early."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49, above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8% at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to effect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.\n [indiscernible] also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.\n Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million.\n As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow.\n Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar '23 from approximately $95 million in '22. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business.\n We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the U.S. government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded. Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide.\n Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply in light of demand. We expect foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.\n Our June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million; Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and Memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix.\n Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar '23 with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments.\n As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar '23, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60.\n EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares. In conclusion, after 3 years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar '23. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar '22.\n Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.\n For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.\n With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.\n So that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than 1, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. Yes. It's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half. And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.\n But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses. SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year.\n It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. Yes, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing [indiscernible] on optical inspection. You asked about lead times of our -- on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question. So lead times are -- on optical inspection are still pretty long.\n There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in and down, WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year given those dynamics. Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, sort of the 23% that we talked about in June and -- even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations.\n And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend. We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall. So look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. Yes. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some [indiscernible] capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%. As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. \n But still growth, to Rick's point. And on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we have certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. Yes. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in '21 and '22 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in '21 and '22 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. \n So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply. So what I would expect, well, in this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendibility and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts.\n It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment. So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand.\n But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. I mean, I -- but yes, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's -- they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there -- they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. Tim, I'm not -- we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now. In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at '23 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. \n Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest-growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us. Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point. I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers.\n And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well. So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market. \n Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has, I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one. We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right?\n We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid-single digit given that guidance. \n And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows. It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. \n You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling but also more layers here moving forward. So those are all positives for us. Also depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. \n So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well. So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market as it relates to foundry/logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall wafer -- and I'm separating this way because I don't want to double count. But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. \n And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the Service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment. \n So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging, so to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter. And it's broad-based. And certainly, China is a pretty big factor in and all, but you also have a fair amount of revenue growth, the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these end markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge. \n And our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots. So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last 6 months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things -- and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue with lower WFE levels as that sustains. Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. \n There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there. So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in 1 year. We talked a lot about 0.5 point to 1 point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. \n And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/logic in terms of overall mix of WFE, that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. Well, as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others. It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. \n But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities. But I am sure they will look for opportunities. If in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. \n You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So those tend to be longer-term decisions. So structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer-term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment.\n What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online. And given the design start environment at 7 and 5, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \n And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Sir, please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to our earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and our March quarter outlook. \n Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. All materials can be found on our IR website. \n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website.\n Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. \n I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023. \n Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment. \n KLA's December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges. \n Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems. \n KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022 with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. For calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate. \n Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection, are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA. Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. \n Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. \n KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation, and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. \n Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. \n To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing 3 main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D. \n Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023. \n Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long term. \n Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thanks. As Rick just detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar '22 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks as we move through the quarter. \n Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5% due to the impact of increasing noncash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter. \n Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendibility of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid.\n Looking ahead to calendar '23, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY '23 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY '22 due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. \n This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAND as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy. \n KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology roadmap investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. \n In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements; maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership; and align our operating structure with top line expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis while delivering strong relative financial performance.\n Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the '22 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter. \n For calendar '23, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million.\n For calendar '23, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, head count and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.\n Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar '23. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares. \n In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after 3 strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends. \n These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions. Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity. Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years.\n We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. \n These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please give instructions to queue for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, first question, you talked about expectations to outperform WFE again here in calendar '23. So curious, can you kind of walk through, is that a comment on total revenues? Or just process control? And within that, how should we be thinking about the benefit from backlog/deferred revenues, particularly into the March quarter? Trying to make sure I calculate that right in my model. \nBren Higgins: C.J., so I'll start, and we'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there are a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because the other industries we're in, it's less clear. But given the Semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology roadmap. So that's always a positive factor for us. \n We also see PC intensity moving up because it -- where you generally see more cycling is in memory. And so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry, that tends to be something that's good for us as well. Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical EUV, our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA. \n China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, I think they're impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022. \n In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of having those -- the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. \n The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. \n So not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to -- longer term, to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for '23. \nRichard Wallace: And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share.\n We don't see any degradation of that in '23 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think '23 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, you talked about expectations for gross margins north of 60% for the whole year, guided 61.5% for March. I guess this is kind of a 2-part question. I guess how do you see kind of a trough revenue quarter here? If you can answer that. And does that mean that we would be below 60% in the back half of calendar '23? Or you think you can stay north of 60% every quarter for the year? \nBren Higgins: Yes, I think we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year, we'll be better than that overall. \n I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So I think we'll likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: I wanted to kind of double-click on your WFE expectations and then how do you think about your model. Are you thinking about first half or second half WFE being relatively balanced for the year and then within your kind of forward revenue expectations for KLA as well? \nBren Higgins: I think my statements earlier were more -- were KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yes, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then just kind of maybe bigger picture. But one of your larger customers have talked about a temporary decline in the 7-nanometer utilization rates, but at the same time, also talking about working with their customers to introduce to backfill capacity, introduce new products over the next few years. I guess how do we think about that dynamic in the context of, like, your print check business and the mask shop? \nRichard Wallace: I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned.\n The other thing, and Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. \nBren Higgins: Yes. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node, most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate. \n And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Your services business last year was strong, right? It was up 15%. Historically, like this segment does not decline during downturns, right? Very stable subscription services contracts, expanding support opportunities, legacy nodes, more software attach, et cetera. But you do have a transactional part of the business, right, tied to manufacturing activity. You've got your EPC services business in there as well and the impact from China export control. So lots of puts and takes. So does the team believe it can grow services revenues this year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to Semi process control, we've only had 1 down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.\n So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support, even if they're not investing in new capability.\n EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in services overall. \n So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about Semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid- to high single digits. And I think EPC systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side. So -- because we have had a weaker '22, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. \nRichard Wallace: And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours, because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. \nHarlan Sur: Great. I appreciate that. And strong patterning growth in 2022, I think patterning was up like 50%. Obviously, part of that is being driven by EUV, Deep EUV litho  adoption. And if you look at ASML's results, I mean that continues strong. But I think they're looking for EUV litho systems being signed off, units being signed off this year to grow, like, 40%, both for EUV and Deep EUV. So litho shipments are always sort of a good forward indicator for your business. You've got positive exposure via your wafer, your reticle inspection systems, print check, litho metrology. Is this going to be one of the -- it was clearly a bigger driver last year. Is this going to be one of the bigger drivers of the potential outperformance this year for the team? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as [ data ] all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business. So it's not entirely just related to the tech. \n And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that. So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in '23. And the metrology, as it pertains to technology advancement development, will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech nodes that have a lot of challenges in those 2 areas. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: If you look at the full year WFE view of down 20%, right, in the kind of the mid $70 billion, that view -- that overall view doesn't seem to have changed in the last 3 months. But something else seems to have downshifted in the commentary from you and your peers. I'm just curious if -- Rick or Bren, if you would take a look back in the last 3 months, what has changed from an assumption perspective? Is there a certain part of the market that you are exposed to? Like, has there been any change in the last 3 months? Because the overall number doesn't seem to have changed. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had 3 months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. \nRichard Wallace: Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hadn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in '23. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, if I'm hearing you, March is perhaps not the trough quarter for the year that -- I don't know, maybe it's June or September. Any way to gauge what that kind of conceptually, the trough quarter could be? Because when I look at memory, I think it's only, what, 15% of process control in Q1. Is that the trough for memory? Or can it get even lower than that? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There are some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in -- I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Maybe just to double back on the performance obligations. It sounds like -- I could be a little bit off here. But in terms of 12 months RPOs, maybe it's -- maybe ended the December quarter, kind of a $6 billion-ish kind of level. Is that about right? And is there a point in terms of as you draw that down a little bit maybe over the next few to several quarters, is there a point in the year you can kind of point to where you think that number will stabilize? \nBren Higgins: So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments. \n I think as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well. But I don't expect to see -- I think it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think it'll level off as we move forward over the course of the year. But look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. \nBrian Chin: Okay. That's fair. And this is probably just digging into a question that was recently asked. But I mean, I think the math might suggest that in the March quarter, the memory system revenue could be something like $250 million, maybe $250 million to $300 million. Maybe that's not trough, but it seems pretty low comparable to recent periods and going back a little ways. And so maybe not trough, but not too far off. Is that kind of an unfair conclusion? \nBren Higgins: I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly, as a percent of the total, as low as it's been for some time. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: The revenue decline in the March quarter is a little more severe than we kind of expected. I guess, we had thought the revenue is relatively stable, especially given the large backlog you had going into the quarter. Is it just that you were able to pull in some of the revenues into the December quarter? Or was it my assumption that revenue could be stable in the near term was incorrect? \nBren Higgins: Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the\u2026 \nOperator: It seems we have lost speaker connection. Please hold, Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty. \n [Technical Difficulty] \nKevin Kessel: Sorry, we got cut out there. I know it's in the middle of Bren's answer to Sidney. \nBren Higgins: So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter. \n As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we needed, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools. \n Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the 2 quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is, is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them, and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. \nSidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. Can I ask a second question? You talked about expecting operating expenses to come down throughout the year. What is a good level to think about exiting this calendar year? Talk about maybe what are the areas you see more -- you'll see more of the cuts. And are there any of the actions impacting the gross margin positively as well? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time. \n It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and $105 billion or more into '23, so $100 billion in '22. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels. \n But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for top line, somewhere in that, I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.\n And depending on how we see the top line evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at '24 and size '24, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: Sorry. Can you hear me? \nKevin Kessel: Yes, we can hear you. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, we can hear you. \nAtif Malik: All right. So I have a question on the memory investments. Are you expecting memory CapEx reduction to be broad this year? Or just 1 or 2 memory makers? \nRichard Wallace: I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. And look, it'll vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So when we look at it, I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. \nAtif Malik: Got it. And then on China WFE, are you expecting China WFE to be down as much as overall WFE? And what's holding China WFE? Is it the trailing edge investments? And what's driving higher investments on the trailing edge? Is it also end market or maybe higher process control intensity? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about '23 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.\n So when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: There was a question before about EUV, and I'm wondering if you can sort of help give a number in terms of how much of your revenue attaches directly to EUV. There's not a ton of inspection in the litho cell, but you certainly get pulled along with anything that helps sort of horizontal scaling, so. And obviously, EUV does that. So I'm kind of wondering if you can handicap how much of your revenue gets carried along with EUV, and then I had a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is -- that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. \n So I would say part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're -- overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5, in particular, work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it. Bren? \nBren Higgins: I think that's good. \nTimothy Arcuri: Awesome, Rick. Super helpful. Bren, I had a question for you on process control systems. It seems like the guidance -- well, actually, it's a 2-part question. It seems like the March guidance implies something in the 16.5% range for process control segment -- systems. So I wanted you to confirm that, first of all. \n And then the real question is the timing of when the process control systems bottoms. Because Lam's bottoming in March, but it seems like if I take low to mid-70s WFE, I assume you don't lose much WFE share. It's kind of hard to see the number not bottoming until you get to 1.1 roughly and you're still at 1.6. So can you sort of answer those for me? \nBren Higgins: Yes. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces.\n The drop-off that you -- and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, my first question is, just to play the devil's advocate. Last quarter, you said the process control argument was site-to-tech roadmap and transition and not as much as to capacity, i.e., less technical. But then, it seems like process control is not immune to the cyclicality. So I'm just kind of curious, like, are these just, like, regular cyclical issue? Is process control actually really driven by tech and not capacity purchases? And long lead time inspection doesn't matter anymore? I'm just kind of curious. Or do you think we get back to trend line in a couple of quarters? Any color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-on. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity, but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transition. So I think you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those 2. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline. \n So I think we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly, a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while because the DRAM guys, memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity, as in none, they're still driving technology transitions. And we know there are multiple players now in logic trying to move forward on that. \n So I'd say it's a balanced approach, which is why we think we'll outperform this year, but not -- we're not going to hold flat relative to that because we definitely had some capacity components. So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Krish, we did share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by, not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows, that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as [ there's ] a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. \n So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Super helpful. And as a quick follow-up, Intel just said a while ago, they extended their depreciation from 5 to 8 years. I'm just kind of curious if that -- does that mean that extending the useful life of semi-cap equipment from 5 to 8 years? And what does that mean for semi -- for process control tools? If you can extend the use of the equipment, does it mean that less purchasing over the longer term? \nRichard Wallace: So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect. \n I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in a long-term view based on that decision by one customer. \nBren Higgins: And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for, not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. \n So I think it's a reflection of, at least, to Rick's point in how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector, not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. \nKevin Kessel: Chelsea, I believe we're coming close to the bottom of the hour, top of the hour. We probably have time for one more question. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I just had a couple of housekeeping questions, if that's okay. The China impact, the export restriction impact in the December quarter and what you're assuming for calendar '23, Bren, sorry if I missed this, but if you can remind us how big the impact could be -- or was in Q4 and how... \nBren Higgins: Yes. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of its impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. \nToshiya Hari: Got it. And then on DRAM versus NAND, I think when you were going through the WFE assumption, you mentioned your expectation for DRAM to be down more than NAND. But when you think about your own business, KLA's business, I would expect DRAM to be a little bit more resilient given EUV adoption insertion and the benefits there. Is that the right way to think about your business in calendar '23 on a relative basis? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAND as a percent. Yes. \nKevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We know it's a really busy day of earnings. We also apologize for the technical difficulties we had during the call, but we will be catching up with all of you here afterwards. So I appreciate the interest and speak soon. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation December 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023. \n Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment. \n KLA's December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges. \n Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems. \n KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022 with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. For calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate. \n Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection, are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA. Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. \n Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. \n KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation, and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. \n Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. \n To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing 3 main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D. \n Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023. \n Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long term. \n Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share.\n We don't see any degradation of that in '23 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think '23 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned.\n The other thing, and Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours, because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as [ data ] all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business. So it's not entirely just related to the tech. \n And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that. So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in '23. And the metrology, as it pertains to technology advancement development, will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech nodes that have a lot of challenges in those 2 areas. Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hadn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in '23. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. Yes, we can hear you. I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. And look, it'll vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So when we look at it, I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is -- that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. \n So I would say part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're -- overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5, in particular, work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it. Bren? Yes. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity, but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transition. So I think you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those 2. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline. \n So I think we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly, a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while because the DRAM guys, memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity, as in none, they're still driving technology transitions.

So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect. \n I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in a long-term view based on that decision by one customer."

            "content": "Thanks. As Rick just detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar '22 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks as we move through the quarter. \n Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5% due to the impact of increasing noncash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter. \n Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendibility of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid.\n Looking ahead to calendar '23, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY '23 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY '22 due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. \n This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAND as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy. \n KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology roadmap investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. \n In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements; maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership; and align our operating structure with top line expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis while delivering strong relative financial performance.\n Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the '22 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter. \n For calendar '23, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million.\n For calendar '23, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, head count and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.\n Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar '23. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares. \n In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after 3 strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends. \n These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions. Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity. Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years.\n We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. \n These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? C.J., so I'll start, and we'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there are a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because the other industries we're in, it's less clear. But given the Semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology roadmap. So that's always a positive factor for us. \n We also see PC intensity moving up because it -- where you generally see more cycling is in memory. And so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry, that tends to be something that's good for us as well. Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical EUV, our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA. \n China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, I think they're impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022. \n In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of having those -- the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. \n The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. \n So not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to -- longer term, to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for '23. Yes, I think we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year, we'll be better than that overall. \n I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So I think we'll likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. I think my statements earlier were more -- were KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yes, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. Yes. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node, most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate. \n And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. Yes. Yes, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to Semi process control, we've only had 1 down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.\n So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support, even if they're not investing in new capability.\n EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in services overall. \n So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about Semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid- to high single digits. And I think EPC systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side. So -- because we have had a weaker '22, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had 3 months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There are some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in -- I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments. \n I think as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well. But I don't expect to see -- I think it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think it'll level off as we move forward over the course of the year. But look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly, as a percent of the total, as low as it's been for some time. Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the... So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter. \n As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we needed, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools. \n Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the 2 quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is, is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them, and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time. \n It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and $105 billion or more into '23, so $100 billion in '22. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels. \n But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for top line, somewhere in that, I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.\n And depending on how we see the top line evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at '24 and size '24, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about '23 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.\n So when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. I think that's good. Yes. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces.\n The drop-off that you -- and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. Yes, Krish, we did share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by, not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows, that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as [ there's ] a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. \n So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for, not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. \n So I think it's a reflection of, at least, to Rick's point in how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector, not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. Yes. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of its impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. Yes. Yes. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAND as a percent. Yes."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q1 2023 Earnings Call to discuss the results of the September quarter and our December quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck, which can all be found on the KLA IR website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some brief quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment, including our business in China. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRichard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend some time sharing highlights of KLA's performance in the quarter, touch on our business in China and provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment. Before we get into details, I'd like to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who have continued to demonstrate perseverance in navigating dynamic challenges to deliver for our customers. Their commitment is evident in our results. KLA's September quarter demonstrates strong customer demand across major product groups. Specifically for this quarter, record revenue of $2.7 billion was at the top of the guidance range, growing 31% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped $1 billion for the first time. GAAP earnings per share was $7.20 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.06, each above guidance ranges. Our performance is a reflection of the increasingly essential role Process Control plays in the development of enabling technology and the long-term product road maps of our customers. As drivers for semiconductor demand continue to diversify beyond traditional PC and consumer-facing markets, Process Control is considered critical in enabling customers to execute on node and technology transitions. As this demand backdrop continues to evolve, our KLA operating model ensures focus on delivering for our customers, navigating supply chain challenges and continued investment in R&D. Now I will quickly summarize key highlights for the quarter. First, KLA continues to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers and is positioned to be one of the fastest-growing Tier 1 WFE equipment suppliers in calendar 2022, substantially outperforming expected overall WFE market growth. Second, our Patterning systems revenue grew 49% sequentially and 67% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered strong quarterly revenue in our SPTS segment. KLA has intensified efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolios of both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $529 million in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Finally, operating cash flow topped $1 billion for the first time, and we generated quarterly free cash flow of $927 million and free cash flow margin of 34%. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, total free cash flow grew from 37% to $3.14 billion. Total capital returns in the quarter were $278 million, comprising $90 million in share repurchases and $188 million in dividends paid. Total capital returns over 12 months ended September 30 were $5.2 billion or 166% of free cash flow and included $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends. Early in October, the U.S. government issued new regulations to control aspects of the U.S. semiconductor industry trade with China. Specific to KLA, a meaningful amount of our business in China is focused on legacy node investment, which is not the focus of the recent export restrictions. However, our system and service revenue will be adversely impacted going forward as we are unable to provide systems and support to certain customers for certain end users. We are assessing the broader implications and engaging collaboratively with the U.S. government to provide the necessary information about our products and services to fully determine the impact on our business operations moving forward. As we look at the industry demand environment, growth for the semiconductor industry has evolved to be more strategic with more diverse end market mix. For the near term, the recognized excess inventories driven by a slowdown in consumer electronics markets, such as PC and mobility, is having an impact on semiconductor device pricing, particularly in Memory. As a result, semiconductor customers are adjusting CY '23 CapEx budgets lower, with the largest impact to date coming from Memory customers. However, long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry continues due to the prioritization of R&D investment at the leading edge, continued investment in legacy nodes and growth in enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. Considering all factors, KLA's long-term targets announced at our Investor Day in June remain intact. In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate sustainable outperformance and highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our teams continue to navigate and execute against dynamic challenges, and KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio to meet evolving customer requirements. The KLA operating model and our strategic objectives are the foundation for our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, strong free cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders. Now our CFO, Bren Higgins, will review our September quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Bren?\nBren Higgins: Thank you. As you heard from Rick, KLA's September quarter results were strong, better than expected and demonstrated our consistent successful execution. While supply chain challenges continue in certain areas and are still limiting output, we have seen marginal improvement as new supplier capacity has come online to meet our requirements. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading growth and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.724 billion at the top of the guided range of $2.475 billion to $2.725 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.06, above the guided range of $5.70 to $6.80. GAAP diluted EPS was $7.20. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40 basis points, above the midpoint of guidance at 63.4% at Semiconductor Process Control systems, which carry stronger gross margins delivered virtually all the revenue upside from the guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $526 million, slightly below our expectation of $530 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 44.1%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped the $1 billion level for the first time ever. GAAP net income was $1.03 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion. And free cash flow was $927 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% and a free cash flow margin of 34%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets in major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with almost $3 billion in total cash, debt of $6.3 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Our balance sheet offers a unique capability to fund our growth strategies, both organic and inorganic, and providing ongoing attractive capital returns to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends paid with total capital returns amounting to 166% of free cash flow. Turning to our outlook. KLA continues to deliver sequential growth and strong relative financial performance. Based on the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, KLA is positioned for mid-20% revenue growth for the total company in calendar '22, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. Furthermore, this business is expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE industry growth, which is currently projected to be up mid- to high single digits to the low $90 billion range. Looking ahead, we expect industry spending to slow. Though early, we are planning our business based on the expectation of CY '23 WFE declining approximately 20% based on increasing global macroeconomic concerns and recent public statements from several customers, particularly in Memory, and the impact of the new U.S. government regulations on native China investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In Memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market as Memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect Foundry/Logic to decline less than the overall market. Specific to KLA, we are still assessing the impact of the new China export regulations. Our preliminary assessment for the combined gross direct impact on our revenue based on our existing backlog and sales funnel forecast is in the range of approximately $600 million to $900 million in calendar '23. This reflects systems and service impact with service representing approximately 10% to 15% of the total. This estimate is before any potential system reallocation for products where supply is meaningfully below current demand, which has resulted in significant lead time to other customers. Given our backlog and forecast, we expect that we will be able to reallocate certain tools to other customers as we move through next year. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition is focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of business environment. While capacity plans can change, technology road map investment tends to be more resilient. This adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. Our December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion, plus or minus $150 million. The gross direct impact of the new China regulations on the December quarter revenue guidance is approximately $100 million. Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and Memory is expected to be around 24% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 55% of the segment mix and NAND 45%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5% due primarily to expected product and segment mix. Looking ahead, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives with the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, operating expenses will grow to approximately $550 million in the December quarter with growth in quarterly operating expenses expected to flatten out as we move through calendar '23. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $66 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.94 to $7.34 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.30 to $7.70. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 140 million shares. In conclusion, although the CY '23 outlook for WFE demand has softened, we remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain important trends. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, considering our strong track record of execution and the power of our portfolio strategy, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable relative outperformance. We will continue to maintain a high level of investment in our product development road maps to enable market share expansion and support customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us to continue to deliver strong relative performance as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, industry-leading financial performance, history of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin?\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Operator, can you please queue for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. As you mentioned, the team has been outperforming WFE and Process Control spending growth for the last few years. No different this year, right? I mean it looks like given your December quarter guidance, your Process Control systems business is going to be up like 30% to 35% when WFE is only up high single digit. I know in the last downturn, like 2019, not as severe, but has potentially 2023 is, but you guys actually grew your Process Control and services revenues when WFE was down back then. So kind of given all of this, like do you think guys just provide some sort of rough framework for thinking about the team's revenue and earnings power potential with industry spending down about 20% next year?\nBren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. It's Bren. Thank you for the comments, and I'll start here, and Rick can join after. So I think the way to think about KLA performance is typically, historically, most of the volatility we've seen in WFE has been in the Memory space. And as you know, Process Control intensity and Memory is quite a bit lower than it is in Foundry and Logic. So I think you have to go back a couple of decades. I think we've outperformed WFE in any down year that WFE has had. So I think that that's always been an anchor for us. We also tend to support customers that are investing in their road maps, right? So as they pull back on their capacity investments, they continue to invest in technology, and so there's a certain amount of business that -- with KLA that continues to happen almost irrespective of their revenue levels. So that tends to be a factor for us as well. And then finally, customers usually continue to run the installed base, and so service is -- continues to operate. We have a contract strain that is the majority of the revenue of 75% plus of the revenue. And so while they're pulling back on CapEx investments, they still tend to run the installed bases pretty heavily. And given how they buy Process Control generally in terms of buying what they need and rely on us to maximize uptime for those systems that it tends to also be an anchor as we move through down periods in the CapEx environment.\nHarlan Sur: Great. And then on my follow-up, good to see the strong EUV mask inspection shipments and Patterning segment was up almost 70% year-over-year. I think that's reflective of the strong EUV adoption this year. And despite the weaker WFE backdrop for next year, I think that the EUV lithography outlook continues to be strong, right? I mean continued penetration of EUV into Memory and Logic and Foundry, and so this should bode well or continue to bode well for your mask inspection demand. But I know last year the mask inspection segment underperformed positive control on growth. What's the team's outlook for your mask inspection business this year and next year, given the relatively better fundamental outlook in lithography?\nBren Higgins: So yes, Harlan, you have it right. So this year is actually a very strong year for reticle inspection. I would expect reticle inspection to outperform the overall Semi PC business within the company. So a very strong year and certainly driven by EUV as 90% plus of EUV reticles in production are running through KLA systems. As we look at next year, I think that there will be continued demand there as you see the -- start to see more investment in the 3-nanometer node. So I would expect the  [ rapid ] business to probably continue to perform better than Semi PC. There's also some investment in infrastructure that's happening in some of the legacy mask inspection and new infrastructure that's being built in China to support the legacy reticles, and so there's also an aspect of investment that's happening there as well. So I would expect it to have another good year this year, a strong year in '22, but also a strong year '23 as well.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And one other thing, Harlan, I think that -- one of the things that contributed to our strength is share gain due to new capabilities on our products. So part of what we were in development for was continuing extending the 6xx product to be able to serve more of the EUV market. So as we do that, we saw some performance. So overall, the segment is good, and then we had some -- the benefit of some share gain as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, just wanted to follow up on the earlier question. I understand you guys typically outperform Process Control like a normal cyclical downturn. But if you overlay the fact that some of your peers had supply issues, which you of course did not, and Process Control tends to be more early cyclical. If you overlay those 2 components do you still expect your Process Control revenue to outperform WFE next year? And then I have a follow-up.\nRichard Wallace: We do for 2 reasons. One  it is true that some of them had more challenges than we did, but we had our own. We could have shipped -- we built backlog, we could have shipped more if we had more capacity. But the other thing is the decline in WFE is going to be based more in Memory than in Foundry and Logic. So that alone helps us in terms of the mix. So I think we're in pretty good position to outperform WFE. Nobody really knows, of course, what '23 is going to look like. But with that set-up, we're in pretty good shape.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Rick. And then just a follow-up on services. What percentage of your services is from China or domestic China? And also if WFE is down 20%, what do you think happens to service business next year?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I don't think we've broken that out. I would say it's less than -- if our systems business in China and Semi PC is somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would expect the service stream is less because it's less developed, right? It's newer in terms of the investment that's happened, and so it would be lower than as a mix of service revenue than that is a mix of system revenue. I would expect service to continue to grow next year. I think it will be below the -- in that WFE environment, it'd be below what our long-term growth rate target of 12% to 14%. I think it will probably be somewhere in single digits. There is a little bit of an FX headwind that happens to service as you have the strong dollar but you have a lot of service revenues denominated in local currencies. You gave a little bit of a natural hedge because you also have cost denominated as well. But there is a little bit of a headwind that's coming on service revenue growth from FX. But I think we'll probably be somewhere in kind of mid-to high single-digit service growth given expectations of WFE that are down 20%.\nRichard Wallace: Krish, when we set the  [ '26 plan ] at our Investor Day, we didn't know when, but we anticipated there'd be this digestion period of WFE just based on the historic growth, so we're still modeling the targets that we set out for [ '26 ]. And we didn't know when, but it seems like it's coming in '23, and we weren't sure if it was '23 or '24, but it was going to be in that period. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are positioned relative to that longer-term trend line. And as Bren said, we'll go under it, but then we've got a lot of systems that are shipping now, for example, that will come off warranty. And so they'll be going into services as we move forward, and feel pretty good about where we are relative to the long-term services plan.\nOperator: We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak to changes in backlog over the last 3 months, how you're kind of incorporating the changes around domestic China embargo. And when are you expecting to get back to kind of your normalized lead times of 6 to 7 months?\nRichard Wallace: C.J., it's a good question. And we'll have the specific numbers in the 10-Q, which we'll likely file on -- probably by the end of this week. But we did grow backlog a little bit. So remaining performance obligations will be somewhere in the mid-13 range. So some modest growth of 13.1 as a reference point in the June quarter. We did scrub a little bit of the backlog given the new China regulations. I think there's more work to be done there as we move into the December quarter. It's still fairly fluid, and we're working through our own assessment of the new regulations and engaging with the government about how to think about certain situations there. So I would expect to see a little bit come out. Certainly, we grew it a little bit this quarter, and I expect a little bit more effort or a little bit more there as we move into the December quarter.\nBren Higgins: So I think from a lead time point of view, it's been a very across certain products. And we have certain products that are high-end sort of technology-enabling products like broadband plasma inspection, our retical inspection tools, our Voyager laser scanning system, SP7 Surfscan products. Those lead times remain very extended. I think it will take some time because we're dependent on incremental capacity to come online to be able to work through some of that backlog. And I would expect those customers to stay in the queue given the long-term sort of demand dynamics around that -- those particular products. But as it relates to some of our more capacity-centric products, I would expect some normalization as we move into '23. I think certainly, we're still constrained today in a lot of areas, and I would expect that we'll see that continue for a little while. But I think as we move through '23, we'll get up with a little bit more flexibility and more normalization on certain more capacity-centric product.\nChristopher Muse: Very, very helpful. As a quick follow-up, I think you talked about $100 million of gross risk related to the China impact for December. And, I guess -- what does the net number look like there? I mean should we just be pulling out kind of $10 million to $15 million from service to reflect that and that you're perhaps repurposing the remaining tools so the net effect is much less? Or how should we think about that?\nBren Higgins: Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it approximately -- without the new regulations, our guidance would have been approximately $100 million higher, right? I think the mix that I talked about earlier in terms of service versus system is about the same in this quarter versus the longer term. And the ability to reallocate those systems in the short run a little bit harder. So I think that as we move into next year, we'll -- I think we'll be able to reallocate more, including some of what we expected here. But, I think, in the shorter run, much harder for us to do. So I think the easiest way to think about it is the way I described it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\nVivek Arya: Just one more on China. Can you help us put this $600 million to $900 million in context with what you're currently doing. In the last 12 months, China sales were about $2.8 billion. Obviously, it's both domestic and multi. So is this $600 million to 900 million derisk enough? And how much is left and what is left once the $600 million to $900 million goes out of your addressable opportunity next year?\nBren Higgins: Yes. It's -- I think it's derisked. We try to provide a range to give you some perspective. Certainly, there's some forecast but it's part of that. But as we looked at what we have in backlog and we looked at what we expect to book over the course of '23 for the affected customers, we were able to go tool by tool to come up with the range that I provided. And service is roughly 10% to 15% of that. We will see as we move forward. Again, we're at a very preliminary stage in terms of working through the regulations and also engaging with customers. There's the possibility that we're able to get some of that back as we move forward, but we'll have to see how that plays out. As I said in the prepared remarks, it is tied to the legacy parts of our business, which are really unaffected by the new regulations. Most of what was considered 14-nanometer and below was already derisked from our plans because we were dealing with similar guidance back in the June quarter. And so what -- the biggest part of the change was the restrictions on the Memory business. And so, I think, we feel pretty good about the range given where we are, the range we provided.\nVivek Arya: And just as a follow-up, I had a longer-term more conceptual question. I know we are far away from '24. But as people look forward and especially this topic of WFE intensity, in the last 2 years, it grows about 15% to 16%. But before that, the industry used to be around the 13%, 14% level. Do you think as the industry recovers, we kind of stay at the 13%, 14%? Or do you think there's a case to be made that WFE intensity can start to recover back to the levels that we have seen in the last 2 years?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. I mean when we look at the longer term -- and it's a great question. And actually, that's the one that I think is the one that we've been spending a lot of time thinking about. The intensity is related to a couple of factors, obviously, but one of them is the challenge with the advanced technology nodes associated with it. And I think part of why it went back up was that scaling resumed, and scaling has resumed both in what we've seen in Logic/Foundry but also in Memory. So I do think it is going to trend slightly higher than it was, that it will be in '19 -- or '23, but it will go back up. Whether it goes all the way back up, it's not exactly clear, but I do think there's going to be pressure on that for people, everybody that's trying to move forward in technology. And the one thing that we know will happen during '23 even if there's a slowdown in capacity, there won't be a slowdown in technology advancement because everybody knows the way you get out of the downturn is by having newer products. So I think it does trend back up. Whether it goes back all the way, we'll wait and see. But I think there's some improvement in capital intensity, and then we're on the strong belief that Process Control intensity will hold on to some of the gains that we've made and potentially build on them as we bring new products in.\nBren Higgins: Yes. Fundamental to our thesis was that we would see semiconductor revenue grow, and WFE would grow slightly faster. So you'd have a flat to up trend line in WFE intensity that would be faster than semiconductor revenue, predicated on the things that Rick talked about, but also that a lot of the dynamics in the industry that drove significant efficiency in WFE have been worked out of the system. And what I mean by that is things like wafer transitions or normal wafer transitions, the consolidation that we saw in the industry and so on because some of the bigger factors. So our view is that there will be a lot of pressure for customers to try to keep it from growing, but that we were growing faster than it is. But most of what is talked about [ different ] customers is to keep it from growing faster, not to keep it from -- to drive it down. And so I think that there's -- we think the long-term assumption that's there is, I think, a fairly straight down the middle assumption in terms of how we think about long-term.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And there's one additional fact. When you look at the regionalization efforts and you think about new fabs around the world, they will tend to be slightly less efficient, which will drive up the efficiency, and those numbers are not really in anything in calendar '23.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the export restrictions. You guys have talked about seeing the Logic restrictions coming, I think, before, and I heard from anyone else. Where were you surprised on the Logic side? And then as a bigger picture question. The fact that this could affect the multinationals, but the multinationals immediately have a license for a year, do you think that gives any kind of pause to investing in Chinese fabs for the multinationals, who could find themselves with large assets that they're unable to upgrade if there's a change in policy? Just can you kind of assess how your customers are talking about all of this?\nRichard Wallace: Yes, Joe, this is not an area where we're going to provide much insight. I think from the standpoint, I think what you meant is that we see the Memory restrictions coming, right, because we talked about the Logic ones. We were not surprised by the export controls that were implemented. And as we've mentioned, we've been working with the government officials as they've implemented those. So we're not surprised by that. When I talk to customers about their plans in China, I think, a lot of what they're doing is trying to figure out what are the implications of those extensions and what's the long-term viability. So I would say that it's a much better question to ask them than us. And ultimately, from our standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter that much because if they choose not to invest there, what they're doing is investing to support demand and they'll move that investment to where they could do it. So that's kind of the way they're talking about it and what we're seeing. So I think from our standpoint, a lot of the -- now that this has happened, we're in a much better position to not speculate but support as we move forward.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.\nJoseph Quatrochi: Last quarter, you had talked about productivity, your manufacturing staying relatively similar rates in the second half into the first half of next year. Is that still how you're thinking about? And maybe in that context, how do you think about that relative to gross margin?\nBren Higgins: Yes. Look, we -- as you see in the guidance, right, we have another step-up in output expectations out of the factories and are still driving to deliver into the first part of the year. I mean, certainly, there's been some customer churn that we've seen. Most of -- sort of adjustments to our outlook are more from a top-down perspective in terms of engagement with certain customers and also public information. I think we'll have to see how it plays through. But right now, we are driving the factories to continue to deliver against what our customers have asked us for. So I think we'll have to see how it plays out, but we start to see some rescheduling as we move into '23. I think those are still questions out there, given just the dynamics we're seeing on the macro front and what we're hearing from customers. But for now, I think our view on the first part is somewhat consistent with what I've said in the past. But I'll have more to say about half to half in the March guidance when we get there.\nJoseph Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Maybe going back to the Investor Day. Now with the new China export restrictions in limiting some of the emerging China customers, how do you think about that maybe changing the long-term growth CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day in terms of WFE, your capital intensity? Does it change given those guys are maybe trying to ramp up on the technology front and so spending a little bit more than say some of the more mature customers?\nRichard Wallace: Well, it really goes back to the -- it's a good question, and we had contemplated rationalization of WFE in support of the overall industry. So that's really how I think about that is that, ultimately, there -- most of our customers end up having pretty strict investment forecast based on their belief of the capital intensity that they can afford, and you aggregate that up to the industry. And it kind of goes back to, well, what are your assumptions about semiconductor industry growth? What are your assumptions about capital intensity and what are your assumptions about Process Control. Those are all in the band of what we considered when we looked at the investment that was going to happen there. So yes, it may be that there was some investment without the revenue to support it. But eventually, it was going to get rationalized. And then we go back to believe in the semiconductor industry growth. You believe in, overall, the question we answered earlier on capital intensity. So it's pretty much baked in the numbers. The reason we set it out for '26 instead of sooner was, as I mentioned before, we felt like there was going to be some kind of digestion period, which we're now facing into, so you kind of get there. As I mentioned, there will be some investment that when you look at some of this regionalization that hasn't happened yet that would have been upside to that plan, and now I think you end up it kind of all blends together. So if you believe the semiconductor growth, I don't think capital intensity goes down, and we feel pretty good about Process Control and our share, that's supportive of the numbers that we laid out. In addition, Bren already talked about the services, which is another big part of it. So a very long way to say we feel like we're still on target for our '26 plan.\nBren Higgins: Yes. You left out the EPC part, too. I think that's one where certainly we're feeling pressure this year and would expect to see more volatility in that part of the business given its proximity to consumers. But we still have an expectation that through SAM growth there that we will see similar growth rates there as well. So we talked about '21 to '26 overall. Rick said we modeled some of the -- some softness in between, but we still feel good about the underlying assumptions of what we laid out.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: So I have 2 questions. The first one is the near term. If I look at your December quarter guidance, can you help us with the growth difference between SPC and EPC? And I know this EDC was down quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, maybe just seasonality in Q1. And then related to that, if you can unpack the guidance for gross margin a little bit, it's down about 100 basis points at the midpoint, can you talk about the pluses and minuses and specifically related to revenue impact of the China regulation? Does that have a gross impact on gross margin? And I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: Oh, good question. So in terms of guidance for December, all the incremental revenue is coming just about all that's likely to come from our Semi Process Control business. I would think there'd be some impact from the new China regulations on service and the ability to grow service quarter-to-quarter. EPC was down. I think it will be up modestly quarter-to-quarter, but the bulk of the revenue increase will come from Semi PC. So I think in terms of gross margin in the September quarter, it was most of the upside, and I think we did better overall in Semi PC than we expected, and EPC was a little bit weaker on the margin than we thought going into the quarter. So we had a very strong mix of business. We had a significant sequential growth in Patterning. Patterning includes reticle inspection, which tends to be a richer product line from a gross margin point of view. So that was the biggest impact that drove the upside. I think as we look at December, again, it will come back to mix dynamics in terms of how we model the business. We're kind of operating in line with the long-term range that I've talked about is somewhere between 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points or so, and we've been operating fairly consistent with that if you look at the broader picture of calendar '22. So we'll see how it plays out. We've certainly been driving the business at a higher level in terms of output expectations. If you just go back to June, what was the consensus expectation for WFE both this year but also into '23? So that's certainly been a factor in terms of how we've been sizing our business in terms of our ability to support and to ship. And as we move into '23 and we see some of that, it could create a little bit of inventory exposure from an excess inventory point of view. So it could have some incremental reserve exposure there as well that we contemplated as we thought about December. So those are the puts and takes. I think the China regs in terms of impact on gross margin, it's more of a revenue impact. I don't think there's anything incremental from a gross margin point of view one way or the other.\nSidney Ho: That's helpful. Great. My follow-up question is back to a cycle question here. In prior down cycles, KLA usually outperformed initially because customers want improved yields, maybe continue to invest in R&D. But essentially, the downturn -- eventually, the downturn would catch up after several quarters, maybe just Memory gets CapEx at first and then time Foundry/Logic comes later. Remind us of why you think this time could be different. And what kind of visibility into 2023 do you have right now just based on cancellation and rescheduling, those kind of things?\nBren Higgins: So we haven't had any cancellations. And there has -- the rescheduling that there's been, I'll call it, churn in our backlog management, but backlog grew quarter-to-quarter. I would expect that we'll see more cancellations as we move into '23. But what we said in terms of guidance of the industry down approximately 20% or so and given our expectations around the mix of business and so on and the history that we would expect KLA to perform well in that environment from a share of WFE point of view. So I think to your other point, look, it depends on how long these soft periods last in terms of how customers ultimately adjust and then what are the demand drivers as they come out of it. But as I said before, we're much more levered to our customers' technology road maps than the increment of capacity. We're certainly doing much better in capacity investment than we used to do, particularly around some of the issues we talked about at Investor Day due to higher design starts and less reuse and so on. So those are all factors for us that are positive from a capacity point of view. But at the end of the day, the biggest part of KLA's business is exposed to development and ramping up production. So as long as technology road maps hold together, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And let me add to that. I mean, at Investor Day, we talked more about our exposure, as Bren said, and the ability we have to scale when there's capacity. I think the other thing that's changed, particularly with EUV is we're actually more an enabling technology now. And before, we might have been more about yield management. And now with some of our products, particularly in BBP and in rapid, those are the tools that our customers have repeatedly said, \"No matter what happens in this downturn, keep us on your list. We want those tools.\" So I think that we've broadened from being primarily a company associated with ramping yields to one of enabling technology, particularly around EUV and then in capacity. So I think we have better exposure, which is why we feel pretty good about how our products are holding up and the fact that we are getting very clear signals from customers that are saying, \"We understand we're slowing overall, but please do not take us out of the list. We need those tools, and we need them as soon as we can get them.\"\nOperator: We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I also had a question on Process Control systems. And I ask because 2023 is going to be kind of a weird year because there's about $4 billion to $5 billion worth of deferred WFE just from 2 of your peers that should have been WFE this year but really is going to become WFE next year, and that sort of optically creates maybe like a little bit of a headwind for your WFE share. So I'm wondering if you can sort of help sift through that and maybe size what your PC systems would be for calendar '23. It seems like $6 billion is a pretty reasonable bogey, but I'm wondering if you like that number or not.\nBren Higgins: Tim, I don't want to guide '23. We're a little bit early on that. I think you're right that there is some of the deferred revenue dynamic that will maybe skew the numbers a bit. But I think also given the things that we just said about how we're positioned into '23 from a backlog point of view and from a technology point of view that we feel pretty comfortable with our share of WFE continuing. But also, I think, we feel very good about the actual market share within Process Control and the -- we think, some tailwinds there as well. So, I think, against the backdrop that you're talking about. If you're thinking WFE is somewhere in the $75 billion-ish range or so, the kinds of numbers are reasonable that you're mentioning. But I'll have the ability, I think, to provide a little bit more clarity around how we see that as we move into guidance for '23 in January.\nTimothy Arcuri: Cool. And then, Rick, I had one for you. There was a question earlier about WFE intensity. And if you take -- the China restrictions are taking like between $7 billion and $9 billion out of WFE for next year, maybe some of that gets replaced somewhere else. But you see all the wafers and all the yields. So would you agree that maybe domestic China WFE has sort of inflated WFE intensity to some degree over the past couple of years? And maybe it's fair to take like a 50% multiplayer? I mean I don't want a number, but just the idea that you should take some sort of a handicap toward the WFE is the dollars because the productivity of those dollars is not equivalent to dollars being spent beyond China. I'm just sort of wondering how you kind of think about that.\nRichard Wallace: Yes, Tim. No, I think that's true. I think that is absolutely the case that you have a situation where there was additional WFE. But it's interesting because that investment didn't really utilize EUV, so that wasn't particularly capital-intensive investment on a relative basis. So in fact, they were prevented from it. So I think over time, there is going to be more pressure on everybody that stays on the technology road maps to invest in technology that leverages, frankly, more to KLA, whether it's in Logic, Foundry or Memory. And so that's why, as we said, we modeled that. It is true that will come out, but it will over time be replaced. So I think, sure, the capital intensity was probably running a bit hot because of that, but that's going to get reset. So I don't think we go back into where we were, but I don't think we go all the way down either. I think it's somewhere in between, and that's how we modeled our 2026 plan.\nBren Higgins: Yes, I would say it's more efficient today than it was in 2016 when we saw all this escalation in investment. So there is a little bit more maturation there than what we have, let's say, 5, 6 years ago. But generally, I would also agree. I think you also have to remember that there's investment that's happening in infrastructure to support legacy domestic consumption, right? And so you have wafer investment that's happening. You have some reticle investment that's happening as well. So I think when you look at that, there is that question about how much of that is real demand versus more strategic investment. And so I think that that's -- there is some adjustment factor there, but it's probably a little bit different than what you might have thought 5 years ago or so. As you think about Process Control intensity, typically in legacy nodes, we tend to then do fairly well as facilities are starting up. But Process Control intensity in the trailing edge, unless they're there are big drivers of some major change, doesn't really -- isn't really as high as it is at the leading edge. So when you think about Foundry, Logic, Process Control intensity at the trailing edge, it's more like Memory, maybe a little bit better than that in China, but it isn't like a leading-edge investment would provide. So it's a little bit different environment there from a KLA point of view.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had 2 questions as well. Bren, on the China impact, in calendar '23, which you sized at $600 million to $900 million, I think that was a gross number. So just curious, given the fungibility of your tools and based on your current pipeline, roughly what percentage of that do you think you can repurpose and ship to other customers, at least on the systems side?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I think it's too early to tell, Toshiya. What we try to do, and I purposely use those words that was gross. I think as we move forward, there are certain products that we will be able to repurpose fairly easily, and there are other ones that might be a little bit more difficult depending that they're back to the sort of capacity versus technology discussion we had earlier. So I'll have a clearer picture on how to think about that. But the way I thought about it was, as I said earlier, I looked at the backlog and I looked at our forecast in terms of expectation and timing of revenue and added up what we -- absent the new regulations, what -- how much revenue we would have, and that drove the range that I provided. And then we'll have to see also, as I said earlier, how as we progress here moving forward, what is truly kind of out and what is in as we start to work our way through and engage with customers and get a clearer picture from the government as we go through. So I think that's the best way I can size it right now is that impact, and I would expect for more higher end products where lead times are extended that we'll be able to reallocate some of those tools.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to get your thoughts on OpEx into calendar '23. I think it's fair to say that the WFE outlook has deteriorated over the past 3 months or so given Memory weakness and the export controls, your business is going to be a lot more resilient than the overall market. But just given how the trajectory has potentially changed from a revenue perspective, I'm sure you're sort of thinking through and revisiting your footprint into '23. How should we think about OpEx? I think you talked about on a quarterly basis, things moderating into Q1. But for the full year, if you can provide some context, that would be helpful.\nBren Higgins: Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it right now is the flattening out. So as we get a clearer picture on what the revenue profile looks like for '23, we'll -- I'll have a better level of sort of quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've invested a lot over the last couple of years to support the revenue growth and to continue to invest in driving innovation and differentiation, which is so critical to KLA's go-to-market, and so we've made those investments. We want to get returns on those investments. So we'll be careful and judicious about how we think about it. Obviously, the reality of the business environment is a factor, but also ensuring that we have the right products to meet our customers' road map requirements over the next few years is really critical. And I think the history at KLA has shown that in a soft period that our ability to invest and deliver what our customers need when they need it. It's been fundamental to our ability to go-to-market to have the portfolio and to share the value that we deliver. So it will be a balancing act across all of those kinds of dynamics. But I think from a modeling point of view, you've got a model that it flattens out. There's also inflation pressures, right? We'll have a merit cycle, so we'll have to work through all of that as well, but my expectation right now is that you'll -- we're tapping the breaks and you'll see it flatten out.\nOperator: And we do have time for one final question. We will take our final question from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: First, I just want to clarify if you and your peers cannot ship the spare parts and services to these projects, will these projects kind of like halt sometime next year as they run out of spare parts? And then I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: The ability to support the tools, I can't speak for the peers. But I can just say for KLA systems, given the nature of our tools and the maintenance that's required to support them and the supply chain, which is fairly custom, that the ability to do maintenance is important to keeping the tools up and performing as designed and expected. So without service, it becomes very hard to utilize the tools that we've shipped.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then the team talked about very nice bookings momentum on auto-related products on advanced packaging and silicon carbide at the Investor Day. Can you update us what you're seeing in the auto market that end market seems to be holding quite well right now and into next year?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I think in automotive, it's been a nice driver for our business, and we've seen meaningful growth really across not just what's gone on in our EPC group but also -- and you have exposure in a few different places, right? We have exposure in our SPTS business, which is for process in power and semiconductors but also in our Semi PC business. And so we have a few offerings that we tailored to support that market, and so we've seen nice growth there. And we're encouraged by the rising semiconductor content, just basic content in cars, let alone EUV enhanced content and assisted capabilities moving forward. So I don't have the exact number in terms of what it is. I want to say it's about $700 million or so this year in '22 in terms of what we'll call kind of auto exposure from a revenue point of view, and we would expect to see that grow over time. And we're engaging at levels with our customers that are driving a different way of thinking about Process Control, given the reliability requirements in auto and the margin structure, the cost of defectivity, the cost of recall and so on.\nKevin Kessel: All right. We thank you and we appreciate. Yes. Thanks so much for the questions, everyone. I appreciate your time on a busy earnings week, and we will be in touch. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to conclude.\nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend some time sharing highlights of KLA's performance in the quarter, touch on our business in China and provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment. Before we get into details, I'd like to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who have continued to demonstrate perseverance in navigating dynamic challenges to deliver for our customers. Their commitment is evident in our results. KLA's September quarter demonstrates strong customer demand across major product groups. Specifically for this quarter, record revenue of $2.7 billion was at the top of the guidance range, growing 31% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped $1 billion for the first time. GAAP earnings per share was $7.20 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.06, each above guidance ranges. Our performance is a reflection of the increasingly essential role Process Control plays in the development of enabling technology and the long-term product road maps of our customers. As drivers for semiconductor demand continue to diversify beyond traditional PC and consumer-facing markets, Process Control is considered critical in enabling customers to execute on node and technology transitions. As this demand backdrop continues to evolve, our KLA operating model ensures focus on delivering for our customers, navigating supply chain challenges and continued investment in R&D. Now I will quickly summarize key highlights for the quarter. First, KLA continues to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers and is positioned to be one of the fastest-growing Tier 1 WFE equipment suppliers in calendar 2022, substantially outperforming expected overall WFE market growth. Second, our Patterning systems revenue grew 49% sequentially and 67% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered strong quarterly revenue in our SPTS segment. KLA has intensified efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolios of both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $529 million in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Finally, operating cash flow topped $1 billion for the first time, and we generated quarterly free cash flow of $927 million and free cash flow margin of 34%. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, total free cash flow grew from 37% to $3.14 billion. Total capital returns in the quarter were $278 million, comprising $90 million in share repurchases and $188 million in dividends paid. Total capital returns over 12 months ended September 30 were $5.2 billion or 166% of free cash flow and included $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends. Early in October, the U.S. government issued new regulations to control aspects of the U.S. semiconductor industry trade with China. Specific to KLA, a meaningful amount of our business in China is focused on legacy node investment, which is not the focus of the recent export restrictions. However, our system and service revenue will be adversely impacted going forward as we are unable to provide systems and support to certain customers for certain end users. We are assessing the broader implications and engaging collaboratively with the U.S. government to provide the necessary information about our products and services to fully determine the impact on our business operations moving forward. As we look at the industry demand environment, growth for the semiconductor industry has evolved to be more strategic with more diverse end market mix. For the near term, the recognized excess inventories driven by a slowdown in consumer electronics markets, such as PC and mobility, is having an impact on semiconductor device pricing, particularly in Memory. As a result, semiconductor customers are adjusting CY '23 CapEx budgets lower, with the largest impact to date coming from Memory customers. However, long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry continues due to the prioritization of R&D investment at the leading edge, continued investment in legacy nodes and growth in enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. Considering all factors, KLA's long-term targets announced at our Investor Day in June remain intact. In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate sustainable outperformance and highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our teams continue to navigate and execute against dynamic challenges, and KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio to meet evolving customer requirements. The KLA operating model and our strategic objectives are the foundation for our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, strong free cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders. Now our CFO, Bren Higgins, will review our September quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Bren? Yes. And one other thing, Harlan, I think that -- one of the things that contributed to our strength is share gain due to new capabilities on our products. So part of what we were in development for was continuing extending the 6xx product to be able to serve more of the EUV market. So as we do that, we saw some performance. So overall, the segment is good, and then we had some -- the benefit of some share gain as well. We do for 2 reasons. One  it is true that some of them had more challenges than we did, but we had our own. We could have shipped -- we built backlog, we could have shipped more if we had more capacity. But the other thing is the decline in WFE is going to be based more in Memory than in Foundry and Logic. So that alone helps us in terms of the mix. So I think we're in pretty good position to outperform WFE. Nobody really knows, of course, what '23 is going to look like. But with that set-up, we're in pretty good shape. Krish, when we set the  [ '26 plan ] at our Investor Day, we didn't know when, but we anticipated there'd be this digestion period of WFE just based on the historic growth, so we're still modeling the targets that we set out for [ '26 ]. And we didn't know when, but it seems like it's coming in '23, and we weren't sure if it was '23 or '24, but it was going to be in that period. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are positioned relative to that longer-term trend line. And as Bren said, we'll go under it, but then we've got a lot of systems that are shipping now, for example, that will come off warranty. And so they'll be going into services as we move forward, and feel pretty good about where we are relative to the long-term services plan. C.J., it's a good question. And we'll have the specific numbers in the 10-Q, which we'll likely file on -- probably by the end of this week. But we did grow backlog a little bit. So remaining performance obligations will be somewhere in the mid-13 range. So some modest growth of 13.1 as a reference point in the June quarter. We did scrub a little bit of the backlog given the new China regulations. I think there's more work to be done there as we move into the December quarter. It's still fairly fluid, and we're working through our own assessment of the new regulations and engaging with the government about how to think about certain situations there. So I would expect to see a little bit come out. Certainly, we grew it a little bit this quarter, and I expect a little bit more effort or a little bit more there as we move into the December quarter. Yes. I mean when we look at the longer term -- and it's a great question. And actually, that's the one that I think is the one that we've been spending a lot of time thinking about. The intensity is related to a couple of factors, obviously, but one of them is the challenge with the advanced technology nodes associated with it. And I think part of why it went back up was that scaling resumed, and scaling has resumed both in what we've seen in Logic/Foundry but also in Memory. So I do think it is going to trend slightly higher than it was, that it will be in '19 -- or '23, but it will go back up. Whether it goes all the way back up, it's not exactly clear, but I do think there's going to be pressure on that for people, everybody that's trying to move forward in technology. And the one thing that we know will happen during '23 even if there's a slowdown in capacity, there won't be a slowdown in technology advancement because everybody knows the way you get out of the downturn is by having newer products. So I think it does trend back up. Whether it goes back all the way, we'll wait and see. But I think there's some improvement in capital intensity, and then we're on the strong belief that Process Control intensity will hold on to some of the gains that we've made and potentially build on them as we bring new products in. Yes. And there's one additional fact. When you look at the regionalization efforts and you think about new fabs around the world, they will tend to be slightly less efficient, which will drive up the efficiency, and those numbers are not really in anything in calendar '23. Yes, Joe, this is not an area where we're going to provide much insight. I think from the standpoint, I think what you meant is that we see the Memory restrictions coming, right, because we talked about the Logic ones. We were not surprised by the export controls that were implemented. And as we've mentioned, we've been working with the government officials as they've implemented those. So we're not surprised by that. When I talk to customers about their plans in China, I think, a lot of what they're doing is trying to figure out what are the implications of those extensions and what's the long-term viability. So I would say that it's a much better question to ask them than us. And ultimately, from our standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter that much because if they choose not to invest there, what they're doing is investing to support demand and they'll move that investment to where they could do it. So that's kind of the way they're talking about it and what we're seeing. So I think from our standpoint, a lot of the -- now that this has happened, we're in a much better position to not speculate but support as we move forward. Well, it really goes back to the -- it's a good question, and we had contemplated rationalization of WFE in support of the overall industry. So that's really how I think about that is that, ultimately, there -- most of our customers end up having pretty strict investment forecast based on their belief of the capital intensity that they can afford, and you aggregate that up to the industry. And it kind of goes back to, well, what are your assumptions about semiconductor industry growth? What are your assumptions about capital intensity and what are your assumptions about Process Control. Those are all in the band of what we considered when we looked at the investment that was going to happen there. So yes, it may be that there was some investment without the revenue to support it. But eventually, it was going to get rationalized. And then we go back to believe in the semiconductor industry growth. You believe in, overall, the question we answered earlier on capital intensity. So it's pretty much baked in the numbers. The reason we set it out for '26 instead of sooner was, as I mentioned before, we felt like there was going to be some kind of digestion period, which we're now facing into, so you kind of get there. As I mentioned, there will be some investment that when you look at some of this regionalization that hasn't happened yet that would have been upside to that plan, and now I think you end up it kind of all blends together. So if you believe the semiconductor growth, I don't think capital intensity goes down, and we feel pretty good about Process Control and our share, that's supportive of the numbers that we laid out. In addition, Bren already talked about the services, which is another big part of it. So a very long way to say we feel like we're still on target for our '26 plan. Yes. And let me add to that. I mean, at Investor Day, we talked more about our exposure, as Bren said, and the ability we have to scale when there's capacity. I think the other thing that's changed, particularly with EUV is we're actually more an enabling technology now. And before, we might have been more about yield management. And now with some of our products, particularly in BBP and in rapid, those are the tools that our customers have repeatedly said, \"No matter what happens in this downturn, keep us on your list. We want those tools.\" So I think that we've broadened from being primarily a company associated with ramping yields to one of enabling technology, particularly around EUV and then in capacity. So I think we have better exposure, which is why we feel pretty good about how our products are holding up and the fact that we are getting very clear signals from customers that are saying, \"We understand we're slowing overall, but please do not take us out of the list. We need those tools, and we need them as soon as we can get them.\" Yes, Tim. No, I think that's true. I think that is absolutely the case that you have a situation where there was additional WFE. But it's interesting because that investment didn't really utilize EUV, so that wasn't particularly capital-intensive investment on a relative basis. So in fact, they were prevented from it. So I think over time, there is going to be more pressure on everybody that stays on the technology road maps to invest in technology that leverages, frankly, more to KLA, whether it's in Logic, Foundry or Memory. And so that's why, as we said, we modeled that. It is true that will come out, but it will over time be replaced. So I think, sure, the capital intensity was probably running a bit hot because of that, but that's going to get reset. So I don't think we go back into where we were, but I don't think we go all the way down either. I think it's somewhere in between, and that's how we modeled our 2026 plan."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thank you. As you heard from Rick, KLA's September quarter results were strong, better than expected and demonstrated our consistent successful execution. While supply chain challenges continue in certain areas and are still limiting output, we have seen marginal improvement as new supplier capacity has come online to meet our requirements. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading growth and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.724 billion at the top of the guided range of $2.475 billion to $2.725 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.06, above the guided range of $5.70 to $6.80. GAAP diluted EPS was $7.20. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40 basis points, above the midpoint of guidance at 63.4% at Semiconductor Process Control systems, which carry stronger gross margins delivered virtually all the revenue upside from the guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $526 million, slightly below our expectation of $530 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 44.1%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped the $1 billion level for the first time ever. GAAP net income was $1.03 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion. And free cash flow was $927 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% and a free cash flow margin of 34%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets in major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with almost $3 billion in total cash, debt of $6.3 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Our balance sheet offers a unique capability to fund our growth strategies, both organic and inorganic, and providing ongoing attractive capital returns to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends paid with total capital returns amounting to 166% of free cash flow. Turning to our outlook. KLA continues to deliver sequential growth and strong relative financial performance. Based on the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, KLA is positioned for mid-20% revenue growth for the total company in calendar '22, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. Furthermore, this business is expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE industry growth, which is currently projected to be up mid- to high single digits to the low $90 billion range. Looking ahead, we expect industry spending to slow. Though early, we are planning our business based on the expectation of CY '23 WFE declining approximately 20% based on increasing global macroeconomic concerns and recent public statements from several customers, particularly in Memory, and the impact of the new U.S. government regulations on native China investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In Memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market as Memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect Foundry/Logic to decline less than the overall market. Specific to KLA, we are still assessing the impact of the new China export regulations. Our preliminary assessment for the combined gross direct impact on our revenue based on our existing backlog and sales funnel forecast is in the range of approximately $600 million to $900 million in calendar '23. This reflects systems and service impact with service representing approximately 10% to 15% of the total. This estimate is before any potential system reallocation for products where supply is meaningfully below current demand, which has resulted in significant lead time to other customers. Given our backlog and forecast, we expect that we will be able to reallocate certain tools to other customers as we move through next year. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition is focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of business environment. While capacity plans can change, technology road map investment tends to be more resilient. This adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. Our December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion, plus or minus $150 million. The gross direct impact of the new China regulations on the December quarter revenue guidance is approximately $100 million. Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and Memory is expected to be around 24% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 55% of the segment mix and NAND 45%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5% due primarily to expected product and segment mix. Looking ahead, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives with the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, operating expenses will grow to approximately $550 million in the December quarter with growth in quarterly operating expenses expected to flatten out as we move through calendar '23. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $66 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.94 to $7.34 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.30 to $7.70. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 140 million shares. In conclusion, although the CY '23 outlook for WFE demand has softened, we remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain important trends. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, considering our strong track record of execution and the power of our portfolio strategy, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable relative outperformance. We will continue to maintain a high level of investment in our product development road maps to enable market share expansion and support customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us to continue to deliver strong relative performance as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, industry-leading financial performance, history of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Yes, Harlan. It's Bren. Thank you for the comments, and I'll start here, and Rick can join after. So I think the way to think about KLA performance is typically, historically, most of the volatility we've seen in WFE has been in the Memory space. And as you know, Process Control intensity and Memory is quite a bit lower than it is in Foundry and Logic. So I think you have to go back a couple of decades. I think we've outperformed WFE in any down year that WFE has had. So I think that that's always been an anchor for us. We also tend to support customers that are investing in their road maps, right? So as they pull back on their capacity investments, they continue to invest in technology, and so there's a certain amount of business that -- with KLA that continues to happen almost irrespective of their revenue levels. So that tends to be a factor for us as well. And then finally, customers usually continue to run the installed base, and so service is -- continues to operate. We have a contract strain that is the majority of the revenue of 75% plus of the revenue. And so while they're pulling back on CapEx investments, they still tend to run the installed bases pretty heavily. And given how they buy Process Control generally in terms of buying what they need and rely on us to maximize uptime for those systems that it tends to also be an anchor as we move through down periods in the CapEx environment. So yes, Harlan, you have it right. So this year is actually a very strong year for reticle inspection. I would expect reticle inspection to outperform the overall Semi PC business within the company. So a very strong year and certainly driven by EUV as 90% plus of EUV reticles in production are running through KLA systems. As we look at next year, I think that there will be continued demand there as you see the -- start to see more investment in the 3-nanometer node. So I would expect the  [ rapid ] business to probably continue to perform better than Semi PC. There's also some investment in infrastructure that's happening in some of the legacy mask inspection and new infrastructure that's being built in China to support the legacy reticles, and so there's also an aspect of investment that's happening there as well. So I would expect it to have another good year this year, a strong year in '22, but also a strong year '23 as well. Yes. I don't think we've broken that out. I would say it's less than -- if our systems business in China and Semi PC is somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would expect the service stream is less because it's less developed, right? It's newer in terms of the investment that's happened, and so it would be lower than as a mix of service revenue than that is a mix of system revenue. I would expect service to continue to grow next year. I think it will be below the -- in that WFE environment, it'd be below what our long-term growth rate target of 12% to 14%. I think it will probably be somewhere in single digits. There is a little bit of an FX headwind that happens to service as you have the strong dollar but you have a lot of service revenues denominated in local currencies. You gave a little bit of a natural hedge because you also have cost denominated as well. But there is a little bit of a headwind that's coming on service revenue growth from FX. But I think we'll probably be somewhere in kind of mid-to high single-digit service growth given expectations of WFE that are down 20%. So I think from a lead time point of view, it's been a very across certain products. And we have certain products that are high-end sort of technology-enabling products like broadband plasma inspection, our retical inspection tools, our Voyager laser scanning system, SP7 Surfscan products. Those lead times remain very extended. I think it will take some time because we're dependent on incremental capacity to come online to be able to work through some of that backlog. And I would expect those customers to stay in the queue given the long-term sort of demand dynamics around that -- those particular products. But as it relates to some of our more capacity-centric products, I would expect some normalization as we move into '23. I think certainly, we're still constrained today in a lot of areas, and I would expect that we'll see that continue for a little while. But I think as we move through '23, we'll get up with a little bit more flexibility and more normalization on certain more capacity-centric product. Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it approximately -- without the new regulations, our guidance would have been approximately $100 million higher, right? I think the mix that I talked about earlier in terms of service versus system is about the same in this quarter versus the longer term. And the ability to reallocate those systems in the short run a little bit harder. So I think that as we move into next year, we'll -- I think we'll be able to reallocate more, including some of what we expected here. But, I think, in the shorter run, much harder for us to do. So I think the easiest way to think about it is the way I described it. Yes. It's -- I think it's derisked. We try to provide a range to give you some perspective. Certainly, there's some forecast but it's part of that. But as we looked at what we have in backlog and we looked at what we expect to book over the course of '23 for the affected customers, we were able to go tool by tool to come up with the range that I provided. And service is roughly 10% to 15% of that. We will see as we move forward. Again, we're at a very preliminary stage in terms of working through the regulations and also engaging with customers. There's the possibility that we're able to get some of that back as we move forward, but we'll have to see how that plays out. As I said in the prepared remarks, it is tied to the legacy parts of our business, which are really unaffected by the new regulations. Most of what was considered 14-nanometer and below was already derisked from our plans because we were dealing with similar guidance back in the June quarter. And so what -- the biggest part of the change was the restrictions on the Memory business. And so, I think, we feel pretty good about the range given where we are, the range we provided. Yes. Fundamental to our thesis was that we would see semiconductor revenue grow, and WFE would grow slightly faster. So you'd have a flat to up trend line in WFE intensity that would be faster than semiconductor revenue, predicated on the things that Rick talked about, but also that a lot of the dynamics in the industry that drove significant efficiency in WFE have been worked out of the system. And what I mean by that is things like wafer transitions or normal wafer transitions, the consolidation that we saw in the industry and so on because some of the bigger factors. So our view is that there will be a lot of pressure for customers to try to keep it from growing, but that we were growing faster than it is. But most of what is talked about [ different ] customers is to keep it from growing faster, not to keep it from -- to drive it down. And so I think that there's -- we think the long-term assumption that's there is, I think, a fairly straight down the middle assumption in terms of how we think about long-term. Yes. Look, we -- as you see in the guidance, right, we have another step-up in output expectations out of the factories and are still driving to deliver into the first part of the year. I mean, certainly, there's been some customer churn that we've seen. Most of -- sort of adjustments to our outlook are more from a top-down perspective in terms of engagement with certain customers and also public information. I think we'll have to see how it plays through. But right now, we are driving the factories to continue to deliver against what our customers have asked us for. So I think we'll have to see how it plays out, but we start to see some rescheduling as we move into '23. I think those are still questions out there, given just the dynamics we're seeing on the macro front and what we're hearing from customers. But for now, I think our view on the first part is somewhat consistent with what I've said in the past. But I'll have more to say about half to half in the March guidance when we get there. Yes. You left out the EPC part, too. I think that's one where certainly we're feeling pressure this year and would expect to see more volatility in that part of the business given its proximity to consumers. But we still have an expectation that through SAM growth there that we will see similar growth rates there as well. So we talked about '21 to '26 overall. Rick said we modeled some of the -- some softness in between, but we still feel good about the underlying assumptions of what we laid out. Oh, good question. So in terms of guidance for December, all the incremental revenue is coming just about all that's likely to come from our Semi Process Control business. I would think there'd be some impact from the new China regulations on service and the ability to grow service quarter-to-quarter. EPC was down. I think it will be up modestly quarter-to-quarter, but the bulk of the revenue increase will come from Semi PC. So I think in terms of gross margin in the September quarter, it was most of the upside, and I think we did better overall in Semi PC than we expected, and EPC was a little bit weaker on the margin than we thought going into the quarter. So we had a very strong mix of business. We had a significant sequential growth in Patterning. Patterning includes reticle inspection, which tends to be a richer product line from a gross margin point of view. So that was the biggest impact that drove the upside. I think as we look at December, again, it will come back to mix dynamics in terms of how we model the business. We're kind of operating in line with the long-term range that I've talked about is somewhere between 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points or so, and we've been operating fairly consistent with that if you look at the broader picture of calendar '22. So we'll see how it plays out. We've certainly been driving the business at a higher level in terms of output expectations. If you just go back to June, what was the consensus expectation for WFE both this year but also into '23? So that's certainly been a factor in terms of how we've been sizing our business in terms of our ability to support and to ship. And as we move into '23 and we see some of that, it could create a little bit of inventory exposure from an excess inventory point of view. So it could have some incremental reserve exposure there as well that we contemplated as we thought about December. So those are the puts and takes. I think the China regs in terms of impact on gross margin, it's more of a revenue impact. I don't think there's anything incremental from a gross margin point of view one way or the other. So we haven't had any cancellations. And there has -- the rescheduling that there's been, I'll call it, churn in our backlog management, but backlog grew quarter-to-quarter. I would expect that we'll see more cancellations as we move into '23. But what we said in terms of guidance of the industry down approximately 20% or so and given our expectations around the mix of business and so on and the history that we would expect KLA to perform well in that environment from a share of WFE point of view. So I think to your other point, look, it depends on how long these soft periods last in terms of how customers ultimately adjust and then what are the demand drivers as they come out of it. But as I said before, we're much more levered to our customers' technology road maps than the increment of capacity. We're certainly doing much better in capacity investment than we used to do, particularly around some of the issues we talked about at Investor Day due to higher design starts and less reuse and so on. So those are all factors for us that are positive from a capacity point of view. But at the end of the day, the biggest part of KLA's business is exposed to development and ramping up production. So as long as technology road maps hold together, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. Tim, I don't want to guide '23. We're a little bit early on that. I think you're right that there is some of the deferred revenue dynamic that will maybe skew the numbers a bit. But I think also given the things that we just said about how we're positioned into '23 from a backlog point of view and from a technology point of view that we feel pretty comfortable with our share of WFE continuing. But also, I think, we feel very good about the actual market share within Process Control and the -- we think, some tailwinds there as well. So, I think, against the backdrop that you're talking about. If you're thinking WFE is somewhere in the $75 billion-ish range or so, the kinds of numbers are reasonable that you're mentioning. But I'll have the ability, I think, to provide a little bit more clarity around how we see that as we move into guidance for '23 in January. Yes, I would say it's more efficient today than it was in 2016 when we saw all this escalation in investment. So there is a little bit more maturation there than what we have, let's say, 5, 6 years ago. But generally, I would also agree. I think you also have to remember that there's investment that's happening in infrastructure to support legacy domestic consumption, right? And so you have wafer investment that's happening. You have some reticle investment that's happening as well. So I think when you look at that, there is that question about how much of that is real demand versus more strategic investment. And so I think that that's -- there is some adjustment factor there, but it's probably a little bit different than what you might have thought 5 years ago or so. As you think about Process Control intensity, typically in legacy nodes, we tend to then do fairly well as facilities are starting up. But Process Control intensity in the trailing edge, unless they're there are big drivers of some major change, doesn't really -- isn't really as high as it is at the leading edge. So when you think about Foundry, Logic, Process Control intensity at the trailing edge, it's more like Memory, maybe a little bit better than that in China, but it isn't like a leading-edge investment would provide. So it's a little bit different environment there from a KLA point of view. Yes. I think it's too early to tell, Toshiya. What we try to do, and I purposely use those words that was gross. I think as we move forward, there are certain products that we will be able to repurpose fairly easily, and there are other ones that might be a little bit more difficult depending that they're back to the sort of capacity versus technology discussion we had earlier. So I'll have a clearer picture on how to think about that. But the way I thought about it was, as I said earlier, I looked at the backlog and I looked at our forecast in terms of expectation and timing of revenue and added up what we -- absent the new regulations, what -- how much revenue we would have, and that drove the range that I provided. And then we'll have to see also, as I said earlier, how as we progress here moving forward, what is truly kind of out and what is in as we start to work our way through and engage with customers and get a clearer picture from the government as we go through. So I think that's the best way I can size it right now is that impact, and I would expect for more higher end products where lead times are extended that we'll be able to reallocate some of those tools. Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it right now is the flattening out. So as we get a clearer picture on what the revenue profile looks like for '23, we'll -- I'll have a better level of sort of quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've invested a lot over the last couple of years to support the revenue growth and to continue to invest in driving innovation and differentiation, which is so critical to KLA's go-to-market, and so we've made those investments. We want to get returns on those investments. So we'll be careful and judicious about how we think about it. Obviously, the reality of the business environment is a factor, but also ensuring that we have the right products to meet our customers' road map requirements over the next few years is really critical. And I think the history at KLA has shown that in a soft period that our ability to invest and deliver what our customers need when they need it. It's been fundamental to our ability to go-to-market to have the portfolio and to share the value that we deliver. So it will be a balancing act across all of those kinds of dynamics. But I think from a modeling point of view, you've got a model that it flattens out. There's also inflation pressures, right? We'll have a merit cycle, so we'll have to work through all of that as well, but my expectation right now is that you'll -- we're tapping the breaks and you'll see it flatten out. The ability to support the tools, I can't speak for the peers. But I can just say for KLA systems, given the nature of our tools and the maintenance that's required to support them and the supply chain, which is fairly custom, that the ability to do maintenance is important to keeping the tools up and performing as designed and expected. So without service, it becomes very hard to utilize the tools that we've shipped. Yes. I think in automotive, it's been a nice driver for our business, and we've seen meaningful growth really across not just what's gone on in our EPC group but also -- and you have exposure in a few different places, right? We have exposure in our SPTS business, which is for process in power and semiconductors but also in our Semi PC business. And so we have a few offerings that we tailored to support that market, and so we've seen nice growth there. And we're encouraged by the rising semiconductor content, just basic content in cars, let alone EUV enhanced content and assisted capabilities moving forward. So I don't have the exact number in terms of what it is. I want to say it's about $700 million or so this year in '22 in terms of what we'll call kind of auto exposure from a revenue point of view, and we would expect to see that grow over time. And we're engaging at levels with our customers that are driving a different way of thinking about Process Control, given the reliability requirements in auto and the margin structure, the cost of defectivity, the cost of recall and so on."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kessel : Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the June 2024 Results and the September Quarter Outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins.

Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. Let me turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will cover a few business highlights for this quarter. KLA's June quarter revenue, gross margin, and EPS were all above their respective guidance midpoints. The quarter played out mostly as expected with strong customer demand and solid company execution. We continue to see signs of a strengthening market environment for customers at the leading edge and remain confident in our plan for steady improvement throughout the remainder of this calendar year and into 2025. This quarter, KLA results returned to sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating an improving industry environment. Foundry/logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies and slowly rising capital intensity continues to be a long-term tailwind. In memory, technology development investments, supporting AI, high-bandwidth memory and the improved in supply-demand environment support an expected return to growth for memory markets in 2025. The June quarter also marked another quarter of strong performance from our portfolio of broadband plasma or BBP products, which we also refer to as Gen 4 and Gen 5. This year marks 40 years of innovation for our BBP patterned wafer inspection business. We continue to see significant differentiation, keeping this product line at the forefront of defect discovery for the semiconductor industry. We expect this product family momentum to continue delivering strong relative growth performance in County Year 2024. AI continues to be a driver and an enabler for KLA's business. AI adoption is driving higher volume wafer manufacturing, more complex designs, larger die and chip size, and growing advanced packaging demands which support an increase in process control intensity. Last quarter, we estimated that the KLA opportunity to would reach approximately $400 million in annualized revenue exiting calendar 2024. Today, we're raising that estimate to more than $500 million in total advanced packaging revenue across the entire KLA portfolio on the momentum we're experiencing. Additionally, AI is enabling KLA to further differentiate our products and make continuous improvement in the performance of our systems. KLA Services business grew to $614 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Utilization rates of existing installed capacity are steadily rising across all business segments as end-market demand improves. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $832 million. The last 12 months free cash flow was $3 billion, with free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. KLA results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio specific product strategies. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product roadmaps, and preparing for growth at the leading edge. I'll now hand the call over to Bren to go through the financial highlights and outlook.\nBren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. KLA\u2019s quarterly results demonstrated our market leadership combined with the consistent execution of our global team. KLA continued to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer's changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.57 billion above the guidance-based midpoint of $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.60 and GAAP diluted EPS was $6.18, both above their respective guidance midpoints. The gross margin was 62.5% at the upper end of the guidance range as a richer product mix than modeled and higher revenue volume drove upside to guidance. Operating expenses were $553 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $324 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41%. Other income and expense net was a $32 million expense and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.6%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $893 million, GAAP net income was $836 million, cash flow from operations was $893 million, and free cash flow was $832 million. The company had $135.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products, and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Moving to our outlook, we believe our business is transitioning from a period of stabilization to a resumption of growth, which began in our June quarter and we expect to continue through the remainder of Calendar 2024 and into 2025. For calendar 2024, we remain encouraged by the improvement in our customers revenue and profitability over the course of this year. This improvement will ultimately translate into new investment in capital equipment to support semiconductor growth over the medium-term. Our high-level outlook for the industry remains largely unchanged. Our expectation is for the WFE market to be in the mid $90 billion range and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. While it's too early to be overly specific on expectations for calendar 2025, we do expect a year of growth, fueled principally by growth and leading-edge investments in both Logic/Foundry and in memory. Given KLA's business momentum, we are confident in our relative performance opportunities moving forward. KLA's September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.75 billion plus or minus $150 million. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecast to be approximately 80%. And memory is expected to be approximately 20% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 83% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 17%. Gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as higher revenue volumes offset by weaker anticipated product mix. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on the current industry outlook, top-line growth expectations for calendar 2024, higher forecasted growth in services and expected system product mix, we are still modeling non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically guarded by product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses are forecasted in September quarter to be approximately $565 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $10 million to $15 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. This is supported by our revenue growth expectations and in-line with our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin business model. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include; other income and expense net of approximately $34 million expense, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $6.69 plus or minus $0.60, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135 million shares. In conclusion, our business has transitioned from a period of stabilization to one of growth. We remain optimistic that the indicators of improvement we have seen will continue throughout the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives which are geared to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence is what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of scaling and increasing complexity has solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control in enabling technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results in process integration and fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across a volume production environment with high semiconductor device design mix. This bodes-well for KLA's long-term growth outlook. The near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving, and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin Q&A. Kevin?\nKevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Operator, we're ready for you to provide instructions and begin the Q&A section.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, recently TSMC said they expect the number of new tape outs for 2 nanometers in the first two years to be higher than what they saw for 3 and 5 in their first two years. And I think they've also heard a number of AI customers accelerate their roadmaps. I'm curious, what does this mean for KLA in terms of your outlook and kind of your share of the WFE wallet. And do you expect 2 nanometer to be a bigger factor for 2025 or for 2026?\nRichard Wallace: Thanks for that. Yes, we're definitely having those same conversations with our customers in terms of in the reticle world, of course, when there are more design starts we see activity in the reticle market in terms of inspection for those reticles and then early lots. We're still early in N2 and in terms of your question, it's really going into 2025 and then 2026. But the other thing we've seen is strengthening in N3 as well. So I think both of those factors are being driven by some of the same drivers we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of what we're seeing from AI driving that. So it does lead us to believe that our goals to increase our percent of WFE continue to be supported by the opportunities afforded by the additional process control challenges. So I think we're in pretty good shape with that. The other thing, of course, is being driven in some of these advanced AI chips as larger die size, which as you know are a bigger challenge from a yield perspective and creates more incentive for more inspection, especially as these processes are brought online and ramped up. So mostly what we see is it's 2025 leading into 2026 in terms of when they reach HBM. Bren, anything to add?\nBren Higgins: No, I think you covered most of it Rick, I would say also 1 of the things that were encouraged by that with the design start environment given the high mix of parts, that our participation with our customers in terms of process control and monitoring that happens in production tends to be at a higher level. So they're trying to manage a robust design environment that's testing design rules in different ways, and that tends to be positive for continuous process control investment as they wrap the node.\nRichard Wallace: Remember, Vivek, earlier in the year, we talked about a more positive tone we were seeing from our customers and it was related to the early demand that they were starting to sense from their customers. That's why we believed and that's how it's playing out that we would see strengthening our business. Maybe what's new, a little bit new is the strength, additional strength in N3 which wasn't as forecasted as the rollout of N2. So I think both of those are adding to our belief that we're in a good period for consistent acceleration and demand on the leading edge.\nVivek Arya: Got it. Now on advanced packaging, you raised it from $400 million to $500 million. I wanted to clarify, is that on an exiting full year basis, or is that for the full year? So just that clarification, then, how would you break it out in terms of specialty and inspection metrology?\nRichard Wallace: Yeah, It's a good question. So that's our expectation for the business level in 2024. So it isn't a run rate necessarily, but what we expect to do, which is significantly above what we did last year, which was closer to $300 million. So a mid-60% growth rate with continuing momentum. I would think that we would continue, at least through the first half of next year, to see strong demand around packaging. So, it's really an opportunity for us. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of customer interest as we're seeing more and more focus on broadband capability moving into the backend. So it's an encouraging opportunity moving forward. I think the growth rate relative to the growth rate at WFE will be higher over the next few years. So one of the things Vivek, I'm sure you've heard is that, one of the bottlenecks now for AI is silicon is part of it, but the packaging come off is also part of what we're seeing. And we had customers for the first time in my career from the front end start pulling us into packaging conversations because they want front-end capability, as Bren said being used in packaging to assist. So I think, we talked about AI being a driver, it's really driving not just the silicon but also packaging and also of course, HBM for -- you need all three of those to fully execute on the plans people have. So to your question on mix, about, I'd say 60% of it is process control. And then you have the remaining 40% is in our process -- specialty process business and also some exposure in terms of chemical process control as well. About 60% of it in the classic semiconductor process control part of our business.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about returning to growth for memory in 2025. I know it is early, but would love to hear kind of your initial thoughts and maybe separating DRAM versus NAND? And then within DRAM, how you are seeing HBM conversion versus DDR5 and greenfields? And same for NAND, later accounts versus any sort of expectations for greenfield in the 2025 time frame?\nBren Higgins: Well, 2024 is really a transition year for memory. We're not seeing a lot of growth overall. Some in the DRAM front and some investment that's happened in China. So I think from a WFE point of view, 2025 is when we expect to see more growth there. I think that you talked about the drivers, particularly around DRAM and HBM being drivers into next year. I think, as we see our customers' business models improve, and we are certainly seeing the financial performance improved with pricing going up, so significantly over the course of this year. But that will translate into investment as we move into next year. I think on the flash market, we're less bullish into next year, although it is operating off a pretty low level. We'll see as we get closer to it. But right now, we do see a recovery in both parts of it, but certainly led by more DRAM than flash on an absolute WFE basis.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And I think much like some of what we saw in the early discussions of AI last year where we didn't really see an increase in silicon because there was still utilization leverage that our customers have. Some of that's in memory. So we really don't see capacity starting to be added significantly until '25 and into '26 on HBM. So as Bren said conversion, but then you don't get the capacity until later, and it's really HBM associated DRAM before you see flash.\nCJ Muse: Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, again in the prepared remarks, you talked about confidence in your relative performance. And obviously, no question around the foundry/logic side, given the complexity and larger die size. But curious, as you see increased memory into the mix, is there enough share of wallet on the logic/foundry side to kind of mitigate that and allow that relative outperformance? Would love to hear the kind of puts and takes around that.\nBren Higgins: Yes, we feel pretty good, CJ. We are seeing relative performance this year, and this is a year that's still pretty heavy overall in what I'll call legacy levels of investment, particularly in China. So as we start to move to leading edge and you see the entry ramp and also the initial investments; and then two we would expect that given our position, particularly in certain markets that we expect to scale and grow much faster than the overall that we are pretty well positioned into next year to see foundry and logic leading edge investment drive KLA share of the overall spend. We were talking about DRAM and HBM. HBM is a device that tends to -- first of all, you have advanced DRAM, you have EUV as a -- you get the introduction of for use of EUV with those chips, but also as you start to put the chips together, it creates not only potential packaging opportunities moving forward, but you also have increased sampling to ensure that each of the DRAM die is functioning properly. So we've seen DRAM improve from a process control intensity point of view since the introduction of EUV. And so I would expect to see that continue as well as we move forward. So yes, I think we feel pretty good about the relative positioning of the company as we move into next year.\nRichard Wallace: So CJ one of the things that we're seeing, and we haven't seen in many, many years, if you remember part of the reason memory had lower adoption was because of repair. And it seems that on leading DRAM, repair is less effective than it's been. And so that is a factor that's driving some of our customers. Obviously, they are going to try to get through that. But that's -- they're expecting that they are going to have larger [need] (ph) for -- a greater need for process control because of that. And as Bren said, you also have -- because of EUV, you get the introduction of print-check into memory, and they have issues associated with pellicle. So I know it's very much into the weeds, but it drives more print-check. So the process control adoption is setting up to maybe be better than historical, while most at least for the advanced DRAM.\nCJ Muse: Very, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: And good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As the team steps into the second half of this year, advanced technology node deployment is accelerating, obviously reflected in your strong guidance for the September quarter, appears to be reflected in your confidence on the spending outlook this calendar year and grows into next. Near-term, does the team anticipate sequential growth in the December quarter? And then relative to let's say, last earnings call has your qualitative view on 2025 improved? I mean I know, Rick, you mentioned incrementally better 3-nanometer investments. Any other indicators that are coming in better versus your prior expectations -- as you look into next year?\nRichard Wallace: Harlan, I'll start here. First, we do expect sequential growth in the December quarter, as we discussed last quarter when we talked about the March quarter being the bottom and expectation of sequential growth through the year. So that's how we see things into the December quarter. We'll see how things play out in terms of what that looks like. I would say on the margin, we are incrementally more bullish certainly when you look at the funnel in terms of opportunities into next year. As we've seen that fill out, we have seen strength in the funnel to support our outlook into next year.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. And then for my follow-up, and this is sort of a follow-on to what Rick was saying, but as you mentioned, memory has always had a lower process control intensity. But there are dynamics that are pushing advanced logic-like capabilities right, into memory. You mentioned more EUV [adoption] (ph) in DRAM, but like for example, in HBM, DRAM, I mean, that's requiring is very advanced logic chip that sits at the bottom of the staff, right? That's using against CMOS logic technology in NAND, the periphery and controller chip, which is increasingly becoming more advanced logic is being processed separately from the NAND staff right, and then bond it together. And then this whole NAND sort of bonding technology process appears to be a nightmare from a manufacturability and yield perspective. But kicking in totality, I mean it does appear that these dynamics are driving memory process control intensity higher. I mean, any way to quantify, I know historically, memory intensity has been about 10%. But if you look at all of these trends over the next few years, like where can you see that memory intensity sort of trending to?\nBren Higgins: Yes. It's a good question, Harlan. And you did cover all the advancements that have us pretty excited in terms of opportunity moving forward. We have seen intensity improve over the last couple of years or so. But what we are waiting for to lean in, if you will, into those -- to that improvement is to see a full cycle in terms of investment by our customers. And so I think as we look into next year, I think that where we are today is probably we're historically around 10% that were probably in excess of 11% today. And I think moving forward, if we can execute and deliver some of the products and capabilities we have in development here, I think it creates a number of opportunities covering the things that you talked about and some of the other things we talked about in the last question or two.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And just contrast that from a few years ago Harlan, if you go back and you think about 3D, 3D happens and our customers go backwards in lithography, right? DRAM is not really pushing design rules nor pushing advanced logic around the DRAM and repair is still working. Like you take all those factors off and you get more into the expected growth and intensity that you get in logic or in the leading-edge foundry for similar reasons. But so we haven't fully modeled it because it's really hard -- customers are still trying to figure it out. But there is more characterization happening at the leading edge, leading us to believe that there is going to be more implementation. But until they've been through the cycles, they don't know, but it is to Bren's point, why we feel more bullish in our engagement in those customers, they recognize an increased need for the process control capability. And then you just add on this bonding packaging question, and that's a huge issue and the value of HBM is so high also. So I think there is a lot of factors. In many ways, there are plenty of opportunities. Then the other part of that, the answer is, making sure that our solutions actually are going to work for those opportunities, and we are still proving that out.\nHarlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRichard Wallace: Thanks Harlan.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur -- I apologize from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one for Rick on gate-all around-PDC intensity. Some of your peers have talked about 30% increase in metrology intensity at 2-nanometer gate-all-around or 3-nanometer. And the reticle inspection peers have talked about EUV map that's actually coming down to 20 from 30 from 3-nanometer. So when we put these two trends together, I'm curious how you're looking at your overall PDC intensity? And does that imply that you're gaining share on the reticle side?\nRichard Wallace: So let me unpack that a little bit. I think that -- it is definitely the case for gate-all-around that it creates new integration challenges and so we've seen, and we've talked about this for some time now, the adoption of Gen 4 to support that in a new configuration to be able to resolve the issues around that. So there is -- that's a driver. It is also a different approach than what customers have to use for the -- because of the architectural [change] (ph). There's more metrology intensity being used and largely an increase in the need to control voltage threshold. So VT control becomes more important. And so that's also a part of it. You also just have film thickness measurement and management hire. So overall, we would anticipate but that's all kind of rolled into how we model the increasing process control intensity that we've outlined before there is really nothing that's different than when we model that going forward toward our 2026 plan in terms of overall process control intensity and our share performance there.\nBren Higgins: Atif, if you look back to the last local high and KLA share WFE, it was when the industry transitioned from planar to FinFet structures. So typically, architecture changes do drive because of just the change that's happening and the immaturity of the change, it does drive process control intensity to a higher level. So historically, it is proven. So Rick talked about not only inspection opportunities, but you are depositing a lot more layers, 20% to 30% more critical layers on the metrology side. So we think in a number of areas, it is going to create opportunities. And you still have the scaling dynamics, while Litho layers are constant. Those are still pretty challenging layers in terms of -- from a defect control point of view. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunities. I think it's feeding into a lot of what we've said here over -- in the last few questions in terms of our confidence moving into next year.\nAtif Malik: Great. As a follow-up, Bren, the revenue guide is a bit wider than usual plus minus $150 million versus $125 million. Is that just a function of higher revenues? Or is there something else?\nBren Higgins: Yes, a function of higher revenues. It's about 5% or so. At some point, as we move through the different quarters and revenue ranges, we start to make an adjustment just because of the higher levels. So there is nothing indicative in that other than the revenue is up 9% higher and we decided to -- it was 9% in June and then the guidance, another 7%. So that it was prudent to raise the range. You have to also remember that we do have integers that are quite large. If you think about our broadband plasma systems, they could be anywhere even plus $20 million depending on the configuration. So tools moving in and out can have an impact in terms of our overall. So it's really more just the increasing revenue level and not related to anything else.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nChristophe Caso: Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question is on the trends that you are seeing in mature node. And specifically -- well, I guess, China revenue in general I think your prior comments were an expectation for China about flat in the second half. You talked about if that's still your view and what you are seeing outside of the leading edge?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. It still might not be the absolute dollar basis right? And then with the second half growing relative to the first half -- the percent will start to move in the second half versus the first half. But on an absolute dollar basis as I said last quarter, it's about flat. Now depending on what happens, you've got a lot of new projects and RevRec could be an issue with newer customers. So where it shows up in terms of which quarter, I'm not going to comment on. But if you just take a step back and look at a half-to-half point of view, it's very similar to what I said last quarter.\nChristophe Caso: Got it. And then following on, you made some comments about the impact of high NA in the past. I mean, one could you remind us a little bit about the impact of high NA on process control? And then secondly, with regard to timing for that, there's been some noise around that about sort of implementation schedules? Anything different than you see on your side? And I recognize that you folks would probably be a little bit earlier in seeing that given the timing of when you install process control?\nRichard Wallace: Well, I think that the difference for high NA -- the most obvious difference is you are going to continue scaling. So you are going to get smaller defects and you're going to have new challenges associated with reticle qualification and that takes the form both in the [mass shop] (ph), and ReQual and in Print Check. So all those factors continue, but it is really an extension of the trends that we've seen. And when you get high NA, you'll get also just the mix will shift. You'll have some layers initially of high NA and then you'll have others that are going to be the 0.33. I think what we're hearing and seeing from customers is very consistent with what we believed in terms of when HVM happens. We don't see any acceleration in the timing. If anything, there's the potential for delay in terms of the HVM implementation, there will be characterization work happening before that. But like all technology transitions, we see the existing technology often extends longer and has more upgrades and it's more cost effective. And that's what drives customers ultimately, it's about the economics. And so I think what will happen is if they can do that, then they'll bias toward extending the life of the 0.33 and the efficacy of that in the leading edge and then high NA comes after. So nothing has really changed in our view. No acceleration, if anything, potential for some additional delay in the implementation.\nChristophe Caso: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one is actually on China and Rick and Bren thanks to the insight on the China revenues. I just kind of wanted to ask a question in a different way. One of your peers ASM International today said that China mature nodes are in a digesting mode and calendar Q1 was the peak. I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that? And how to think about China sales into next year, especially given a long lead time you might have a better insight than others? And also, is that a factor in your gross margin down just a smidge in September quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: Yes, Krish. On China, it looks -- like I said earlier, I think from a half-to-half point of view, it's relatively flat. So I don't see any real change. A lot of that's dependent on project timing given the level of greenfield activity that we're seeing there. As we move into next year, my early view on our business levels is more or less consistent with what we're seeing this year. I think when you look at the order funnel, what we have in backlog, what we have in deposits, gives me some confidence in terms of what we see into next year. So I don't see a change. Obviously, the mix could -- will be changing. There's infrastructure investments. It's obviously the logic/foundry memory and so on. But from an overall level, it seems that it is pretty consistent year-to-year. On gross margin, it -- while we outperformed in the June quarter, it was a little bit more than what we had initially modeled in the quarter. There is some investment that we're seeing in the September quarter from that. When you look at KLA gross margins, I talk a lot about product mix being the biggest driver of our gross margin in terms of variability quarter-to-quarter. It's not customer mix, it's not region mix. It is the portfolio mix and not all the products in our portfolio carry the same margin profile, but also within the product families themselves. And particularly when you're selling across multiple nodes with highly configurable systems, you can end up with bearing gross margin profile even within the same product families. So it's really a function of that than it is anything else. And of course, the June quarter was stronger. I did put the comments, which were very consistent with last quarter in terms of expectations for this year in the mid 61% range. That's our expectation. And then moving forward, as we see the business continue to grow into [2025] (ph), I think you'll see KLA's general incremental gross margin performance in and around that 65% incremental gross margin, plus or minus, as we move forward here. But in any given quarter, it could add a little bit of variability, but nothing that's different than what we usually see.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. Thanks for the color, like the $500 million run rate from $400 million like three months ago. Is this really a function of the advanced packaging market growing? Or -- are you like targeting markets like macro inspection, which I feel like your peers or your competitors are doing better than that? Are you like targeting those markets that's also helping some of this incremental revenue growth [indiscernible] this year? And also kind of curious if you can extrapolate that into like panel-level packaging, which is probably a few years out? Thank you.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. I think there is no question that the package market is growing, and it's for all the reasons that you hear, I think that there's been an acceleration. And again, I mentioned earlier in the call that some of the gaps, if you think about what's going on overall with AI or packaging shortage related. So there is a lot of investment happening there. Is it not -- it's not just macro, it's what historically would have been considered pretty advanced lithography not that -- or inspection not that many years ago because the design rules and the yield and the what's at risk, cost-wise is much higher. Many years ago, when we bought a company and started doing packaging, one of our customers ask, why are you even bothering, this is not a KLA market. What happened in the last year is now customers are saying, we need your capability that you have in the front end to be applied into some of our advanced packaging challenges and accelerated workshops with us talking about that accelerated product road maps and a lot of customer excitement and interest. So they're driving it very hard because they have shortages, and it is really across many of our products, both in our processing, but also in our process control. So it's been significant to see the growth and the speed of it. As we said, that's the annualized -- that's the annual number for calendar '24, but we'd expect the trend to continue towards growth in '25 and beyond.\nBren Higgins: Most of our growth has been more on the logic side. And I think one of the things we are excited about moving forward is that as you move in high-bandwidth memory to hybrid bonding techniques, they do increase the complexity of the process of fair amount. And as you know, the KLA position in the market is one of higher value offerings, supporting more complexity. And so we're encouraged by what those opportunities might look like as we get out into the into the '26 and '27 time frame. Obviously, the industry is thinking a lot about what's next in terms of panel level packaging and so on. And so there is obviously R&D that goes into that. But -- so that's work that we will be doing in the company. And so I think that those opportunities, to Rick's point, are just showcasing, I think what's the opportunities that are available in this part of the market over the next several years.\nRichard Wallace: Just one final point. Some of our customers -- our competitors are coming at this from a lower end. And in many cases, the requirements are at the top end of their capability. And so what we're hearing from customers is, even though in some cases, they are buying our systems, what are at the bottom-end of our capability, what they also want is the road map. So I think they want the ability to buy that capability now the expectation and the knowledge that they can upgrade it over time as their requirements continue because you are now with that packaging. There is no question that road map is going to look more like a traditional scaling road map going forward.\nKrish Sankar: Gotcha. It\u2019s future proofing. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren. Very helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Wallace: Thanks Krish.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Quattrocci: Yeah, thank you taking the question. I just want to kind of understand, I think looking at the guide for the September quarter and thinking about sequential growth into the December quarter, is it more fair to assume now they're kind of thinking about low double-digit half-on-half growth rate for the calendar year relative to the high single digit last quarter that you talked about. And then kind of duck-tailing that, I think last quarter, you talked about process control systems mixes being closer to like 70% for foundry/logic. Is that maybe a bit higher than that now?\nBren Higgins: Yes. So on those fronts so again, I don't want to guide December, but I think high single digit, low double digit is probably the right way to think about our performance for the year overall. So I think that as we saw in June relative to the expectations we had a few months ago, we did better than we thought September guide was higher, certainly higher than what consensus was. So I think the incremental optimism I talked about earlier in the funnel is revealing and some incremental growth here through the second half of the year. When I look at the overall mix of business, I think that foundry/logic is likely closer to 75%. So last year 70%-30% or approximate semiconductor process control shipments -- or revenue to semiconductor customers is closer to [75%, 25% and 24%] (ph). But we'll see how it ends up.\nJoseph Quattrocci: Perfect. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, the [N3] (ph) strength you're talking about, I mean, given the lead times for Gen 4, Gen 5, I mean is that going to kind of enter the model in terms of demand into next year? Is that how we should think about that? Or can some of those tools be pulled into 2024?\nBren Higgins: Well, we are seeing more capacity come online. Those are products where we've been supply constrained certainly around Gen 4. So as new capacity comes online. I think it's one of the challenges for us frankly, back in 2023 as we were limited and as we move through this year, from a quarterly run rate point of view, we are getting incremental supply and that -- given the supply constraints and the level of demand, we are seeing growth there and would expect to see that continue into next year. So I'm fairly bullish on that part of the business growing faster than the overall market, both this year and next year. So I think that's one of those areas that I said earlier about our relative confidence in terms of share of the overall market is our presence in certain markets that are growing extremely fast relative to the overall and certainly high-end wafer inspection is one of those.\nJoseph Quattrocci : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to double quick on China and what you're seeing in the region. You guys gave a lot of color in terms of what you're expecting for the overall geo. But by application, any standouts as you think about DRAM, foundry, other applications or maybe by customer type, mask making, wafer making, et cetera, whether it be trends you saw in the first half? Or as you think about the flattish outlook in the second half, and you stand out to the positive side or the negative side?\nBren Higgins: DRAM was stronger in the first half and will be in the second half. I would expect that wafers probably a little weaker. I think on the reticle side, it is a little bit stronger. And then foundry/logic is stronger offsetting the weaker memory.\nRichard Wallace: Some weakness in automotive.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on your services business, you guys grew 14% year-over-year. and you are outperforming your peers, and I think that's off of a higher base relative to your peers, too, so really good to see that. You talked about growing toward the high end for the remainder of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Is that just simply utilization rates across your customer base improving? Or is there more to it? And as a quick follow-up, is 12% to 14% still the right range?\nBren Higgins: Yes. So utilization rates are certainly a factor. So we've seen those steadily improve across all segments in the course of this year. And so that's been a driver of incremental revenue. The other thing, and we had pretty good visibility to this was the shipments that we -- or the tools that we shipped in '21 and '22, have come off of warranty and gone into contract. In our contract renewal or attach rate is about 95%. So as those tools go up a warranty into contract that that's a driver. So we've had pretty good visibility into the service business. We've had a headwind from FX because you do have some of the service revenue denominated in local currency particularly in Japan. So there's been some headwinds to the growth rate, frankly. But yes, we are trending towards that 14% sort of top part of the guidance range. And I think for the target we put out there. And I think as we go over the next couple of years, I feel like we are closer to the top end of the range than the bottom end of the range. Thank you Toshiya.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I also had a couple of China follow-ups. At one point, you had a pretty sizable multi-national business in China is the business today mostly dominated by the China sovereigns, I assume?\nBren Higgins: Yes. We are a very little multinational business in China.\nJoe Moore: Okay. And then on the China sovereign side, I mean, having seen that business shift to more of a trailing edge focus, what's happened to process control intensity? And you seem to be keeping pace with all of your competitors in terms of China exposure. So you seem to be doing quite well. I might have thought that the process control intensity would drop off given the focus on lagging edge technology.\nRichard Wallace: Sure. It is definitely not as high as what you would see on leading edge. But often in the case of you have small relatively size-wise small sites, then you are not really up against the percent against a huge number of wafer starts. So that's one factor. The other factor is some of the infrastructure that people are adding in terms of whether it is mask shops or wafer. So in aggregate, that's why it's for us, it's pretty much helps serve.\nBren Higgins: And Joe, on the multinational question, I mean, most of that business is service, right? We're not really -- there's no real equipment business that's happening with our multinational customers there, but there is sort of this activity supporting those fabs.\nJoe Moore: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And then we'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Hi guys. Couple of long -- actually, one question about 2025 WFE. Rick obviously, demand is improving across the board, in China is stable. So that makes sense that WFE will grow next year. I'm just wondering in terms of -- in your assumptions, what sort of assumptions are you making as far as the chips money is concerned? Because the check seems to be coming in, in second half. Just wondering if we're getting an explicit signals from your customers that, that money is being spent in 2025?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. Our forecasts are entirely independent of any [ChipPAC] (ph) money. There's no dependence on that. That if our customers receive that, it's going to be -- they're going to be getting it what they tell us is to offset cost of building fabs in places that are more expensive. But it's not contributing to that they are going to build capacity based on demand. The demand is just going to be based on their market, the overall market and then they'll buy equipment accordingly. But we are not counting on our customers get ChipPAC money to make our plans.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Okay. Thank you. And then more of a technology question, Rick. I time to time, get questions about APMI for mask inspection. My understanding is that you guys were involved in that market and maybe exited at some point? I'm just curious, maybe I'm wrong here, but I just want to get your thoughts on that as to how you are approaching that market and what your strategy for that market is?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. We have not -- we're heavily involved in the reticle market. It's a market that really we started comparing with, and we're still involved in it heavily. The question on, do you need actinic inspection for reticles. It's been a long debate that we've had in our conclusion based on all the analysis that we've seen is the real market need for that is when high NA gets introduced because of the existing technology nodes, there's really three ways to deal with the problems. One is the challenges of reticle quality. One is the flagship product line that we've had for a long time, the 6xx accident extensions to that. The other one is an e-beam product that we've talked about that's being used for very high resolution. And right now, it is the highest sensitivity reticle inspection tool still in where -- with our customers, we are still in the characterization of that tool, that's the 8xx. And then the last one is printing onto wafers and verifying the goodness of the reticles and that's what we're using basically using the Gen 5 print check application for. When it comes to investment in the actinic or the product that we've identified for high NA, we're pretty confident of our ability to intercept the high volume manufacturing of high NA, which is still some years away.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrian Chin: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Rick, you talked about inflections and sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Are you also seeing this in terms of bookings? And did your 12-month [shippable RPO] (ph) increase this quarter?\nRichard Wallace: So we'll have all the specifics on that in the 10-K that we'll file here another week or two. It was pretty close to flat, down about $70 million quarter-on-quarter, so pretty flattish compared to last quarter. I think given what we're seeing in the funnel, I would expect it likely to probably over the next few quarters, we'll start to see it increase. But yes, just slightly down from last quarter.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess you've made a lot of disclosures in the past couple of calls about advanced packaging, and you saw even a step-up on the year forecast over the past three months. Can you sort of ballpark how large the advanced packaging process control TAM is? It's \u2013 you are probably not at your kind of typical on average 50%, 60% market share in process control overall. But maybe a sense of where the starting point is now. And obviously, I'm sure you expect the market to grow and probably your share as well in the years ahead.\nRichard Wallace: I'll let Bren deal with the specifics. This is Rick. But it's not just process control for us. It is also process tools because of the SPTS acquisition we did about five years ago.\nBren Higgins: Yes. Look, we -- right now, our view is that this part of the market will grow faster than overall WFE. So if you look in the long run, as we expect WFE over the next few years, the capital intensity slowly rising to grow a little bit faster than semiconductor revenue that this part of the market will likely grow faster than that. So that's the only quantifying we've done at this point. To Rick's point, we have a broad portfolio, we are seeing parts of it on the inspection side move up market, but we also sell a number of process tools. We also sell some chemical process control capability as well. So we are approaching this market in multiple ways. And like I said I think that, as we talked about earlier, in the memory part of the market as it relates to HBM, we think we are better positioned relative to some of the technology transitions that are coming in terms of our share opportunity moving forward.\nBrian Chin: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you on the outlook for EPC. I think you were looking for growth last time. Might came in a little bit below. Just curious since we're going through all the calendar '24 forecast, if you could update that one.\nBren Higgins: Yes. On specialty semiconductor quarter-to-quarter, it dipped a little bit in the June quarter, but that's for the timing issue. I think our expectation in that business is still some modest growth for the year. That has -- that business has a pretty diversified market exposure. And as power semi related to automotive has come down. We've seen packaging pick up, but there's a little bit of a dip in June, but recovers and has a much stronger second half. Flat panel business is where we announced our exit of that, and so we still have revenue in our plans for that as we exit that business and would expect in the manufacturing likely in Q1 of 2025. On the PCB front, which is more consumer centric, we still have -- that market has been relatively sluggish, it is improved a bit, but not much. And that's obviously tied much more to mobility. And so improvements into the future as we see more cell phone unit growth will drive that business. Now there was -- that business had a very strong '21 and into '22, a lot of capacity added during that coded period. And so the industry is still working off some of that capacity. Now in that business, we do have service exposure. So you have pretty good contract penetration in the PCB world. So while the systems business has been slower, there have been service contributions from a revenue point of view that we've had over the last year or so. But I would think that overall the aggregate part of that business is up a few points year-to-year. I think it is -- we'll call low to mid-single digits.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask -- I know there's been a couple of questions on China. I hear from others that you're hearing less new names, and I think the thought was maybe it would be more build-out of facilities that were already in process. You talked about greenfield there. And obviously, there's another slug of money potentially coming in. So as you look out a year more. I'm just kind of curious how you think about that frenzy we had before of all these new names that you never heard of before, creating companies. Are you seeing any view that, that might come back?\nBren Higgins: Well, there's still some new business from new customers. The other thing that's happening in China is you do see investment from our mature legacy customers in China. And so where we've been engaged in supporting those customers for many, many years. And their businesses are typically driven by supply for specific markets and in response to expectations of demand moving forward. So you do have those customers also investing more here, I think moving forward. And then you do move into second phases with certain ones, but there is also some new ones too. So it's a pretty broad mix as I look at the remainder of this year and into next year.\nBlayne Curtis: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question today from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks. I had two. So Bren, my question on China. So there's been some recent news. Obviously, the US diplomatic commerce is trying to use the [foreign reticle] (ph) against some of the non-U.S. suppliers and it would kind of suggest that maybe there's some forthcoming news that there is a reason why they would want to use the FDPR, like maybe some entity-list addition. So how do you think about that? I know it's kind of hard for you to even handicap your guidance for that? And I assume you're not accounting for that at all because you don't even know like whether that's going to come. But how do you kind of think about that and what the likelihood is and how do you even handicap for it?\nBren Higgins: Yes, Tim, I mean, there's been a lot of news for some time. And so you're right, I can't participate here in speculation and hypotheticals about what could or could not happen. So we will continue to assess, we\u2019re very closely with the US government. Of course, we do everything we need to do in the company to be in compliance. We will follow the laws we do, and we'll support our customers as well within the confines of whatever the regulations are. So if and when something happens, we'll assess the impact and let you know what the impact is in sort of the near term and what might be over the long term.\nRichard Wallace: Well, one of the things we talked about a lot, Tim, and I know you know this, is the because of where we are with the AI drivers, we're seeing an acceleration at the leading edge. So if we think about what's really going to propel our business going forward, it's not so much the legacy, which has been may be overrepresented on historical levels the last few years. But it's the stuff we are seeing right now, especially at the leading edge in terms of leading-edge foundry, and that's been driving a lot of our business in our expectations around what we are seeing in N3 and N2, plus the packaging plus we're seeing in HBM. So if I think about \u201825, \u201826, those are going to be the things that drive KLA drive our performance and should drive good opportunities for our investors.\nBren Higgins: If you go back to 2022, 75% plus of our business was what we'll call leading edge advanced design rules, 20-nanometer or below. So with the expectation of a ramp into next year from our leading-edge customers on the logic and memory side, we think that, that's going to drive the hundreds of our business as we move over the course of next year and beyond.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. And then last thing. So book-to-bill based on the RPO, book-to-bill was just a touch below 1%. So this is the seventh quarter that it's been below one. And it sounds like you think book-to-bill is going to start to drift up actually that we are going to finally start to be above one. So is there some dynamic where it seems like there was this massive slug of bookings that happened back in mid-'22 and we've been kind of shipping off of that ever since. And are we kind of getting to a point now where you think that customers are kind of coming back in and there and we could begin to see book-to-bill start to drift above one, where we can start to not just be shipping off of this big slug of orders in the middle of 2022?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I think based on the funnel that we will see -- I think the order profile looks pretty good. Now orders are not always indicative of what's going on given the number of customers and the size of the orders. And then when it comes to KLA, even the size of the ASPs of certain types of products. But all that being said, yes, it went from about $13 billion at its peak in terms of RPO down to just 10 today. So it's still quite large, but I would expect that moving forward that at least over the next couple of quarters, it looks that the order profile looks decent. So yes, I think that's a reasonable way to see it.\nRichard Wallace: Thank you Tim.\nOperator: I'll now turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kessel: All right. On behalf of KLA, we appreciate your time and your interest. We'll be seeing many of you through this quarter at different conferences. If you have any follow-up questions, please do reach out to the KLA Investor Relations team. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude the call.\nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will cover a few business highlights for this quarter. KLA's June quarter revenue, gross margin, and EPS were all above their respective guidance midpoints. The quarter played out mostly as expected with strong customer demand and solid company execution. We continue to see signs of a strengthening market environment for customers at the leading edge and remain confident in our plan for steady improvement throughout the remainder of this calendar year and into 2025. This quarter, KLA results returned to sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating an improving industry environment. Foundry/logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies and slowly rising capital intensity continues to be a long-term tailwind. In memory, technology development investments, supporting AI, high-bandwidth memory and the improved in supply-demand environment support an expected return to growth for memory markets in 2025. The June quarter also marked another quarter of strong performance from our portfolio of broadband plasma or BBP products, which we also refer to as Gen 4 and Gen 5. This year marks 40 years of innovation for our BBP patterned wafer inspection business. We continue to see significant differentiation, keeping this product line at the forefront of defect discovery for the semiconductor industry. We expect this product family momentum to continue delivering strong relative growth performance in County Year 2024. AI continues to be a driver and an enabler for KLA's business. AI adoption is driving higher volume wafer manufacturing, more complex designs, larger die and chip size, and growing advanced packaging demands which support an increase in process control intensity. Last quarter, we estimated that the KLA opportunity to would reach approximately $400 million in annualized revenue exiting calendar 2024. Today, we're raising that estimate to more than $500 million in total advanced packaging revenue across the entire KLA portfolio on the momentum we're experiencing. Additionally, AI is enabling KLA to further differentiate our products and make continuous improvement in the performance of our systems. KLA Services business grew to $614 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Utilization rates of existing installed capacity are steadily rising across all business segments as end-market demand improves. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $832 million. The last 12 months free cash flow was $3 billion, with free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. KLA results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio specific product strategies. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product roadmaps, and preparing for growth at the leading edge. I'll now hand the call over to Bren to go through the financial highlights and outlook. Thanks for that. Yes, we're definitely having those same conversations with our customers in terms of in the reticle world, of course, when there are more design starts we see activity in the reticle market in terms of inspection for those reticles and then early lots. We're still early in N2 and in terms of your question, it's really going into 2025 and then 2026. But the other thing we've seen is strengthening in N3 as well. So I think both of those factors are being driven by some of the same drivers we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of what we're seeing from AI driving that. So it does lead us to believe that our goals to increase our percent of WFE continue to be supported by the opportunities afforded by the additional process control challenges. So I think we're in pretty good shape with that. The other thing, of course, is being driven in some of these advanced AI chips as larger die size, which as you know are a bigger challenge from a yield perspective and creates more incentive for more inspection, especially as these processes are brought online and ramped up. So mostly what we see is it's 2025 leading into 2026 in terms of when they reach HBM. Bren, anything to add? Remember, Vivek, earlier in the year, we talked about a more positive tone we were seeing from our customers and it was related to the early demand that they were starting to sense from their customers. That's why we believed and that's how it's playing out that we would see strengthening our business. Maybe what's new, a little bit new is the strength, additional strength in N3 which wasn't as forecasted as the rollout of N2. So I think both of those are adding to our belief that we're in a good period for consistent acceleration and demand on the leading edge. Yeah, It's a good question. So that's our expectation for the business level in 2024. So it isn't a run rate necessarily, but what we expect to do, which is significantly above what we did last year, which was closer to $300 million. So a mid-60% growth rate with continuing momentum. I would think that we would continue, at least through the first half of next year, to see strong demand around packaging. So, it's really an opportunity for us. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of customer interest as we're seeing more and more focus on broadband capability moving into the backend. So it's an encouraging opportunity moving forward. I think the growth rate relative to the growth rate at WFE will be higher over the next few years. So one of the things Vivek, I'm sure you've heard is that, one of the bottlenecks now for AI is silicon is part of it, but the packaging come off is also part of what we're seeing. And we had customers for the first time in my career from the front end start pulling us into packaging conversations because they want front-end capability, as Bren said being used in packaging to assist. So I think, we talked about AI being a driver, it's really driving not just the silicon but also packaging and also of course, HBM for -- you need all three of those to fully execute on the plans people have. So to your question on mix, about, I'd say 60% of it is process control. And then you have the remaining 40% is in our process -- specialty process business and also some exposure in terms of chemical process control as well. About 60% of it in the classic semiconductor process control part of our business. Yes. And I think much like some of what we saw in the early discussions of AI last year where we didn't really see an increase in silicon because there was still utilization leverage that our customers have. Some of that's in memory. So we really don't see capacity starting to be added significantly until '25 and into '26 on HBM. So as Bren said conversion, but then you don't get the capacity until later, and it's really HBM associated DRAM before you see flash. So CJ one of the things that we're seeing, and we haven't seen in many, many years, if you remember part of the reason memory had lower adoption was because of repair. And it seems that on leading DRAM, repair is less effective than it's been. And so that is a factor that's driving some of our customers. Obviously, they are going to try to get through that. But that's -- they're expecting that they are going to have larger [need] (ph) for -- a greater need for process control because of that. And as Bren said, you also have -- because of EUV, you get the introduction of print-check into memory, and they have issues associated with pellicle. So I know it's very much into the weeds, but it drives more print-check. So the process control adoption is setting up to maybe be better than historical, while most at least for the advanced DRAM. Harlan, I'll start here. First, we do expect sequential growth in the December quarter, as we discussed last quarter when we talked about the March quarter being the bottom and expectation of sequential growth through the year. So that's how we see things into the December quarter. We'll see how things play out in terms of what that looks like. I would say on the margin, we are incrementally more bullish certainly when you look at the funnel in terms of opportunities into next year. As we've seen that fill out, we have seen strength in the funnel to support our outlook into next year. Yes. And just contrast that from a few years ago Harlan, if you go back and you think about 3D, 3D happens and our customers go backwards in lithography, right? DRAM is not really pushing design rules nor pushing advanced logic around the DRAM and repair is still working. Like you take all those factors off and you get more into the expected growth and intensity that you get in logic or in the leading-edge foundry for similar reasons. But so we haven't fully modeled it because it's really hard -- customers are still trying to figure it out. But there is more characterization happening at the leading edge, leading us to believe that there is going to be more implementation. But until they've been through the cycles, they don't know, but it is to Bren's point, why we feel more bullish in our engagement in those customers, they recognize an increased need for the process control capability. And then you just add on this bonding packaging question, and that's a huge issue and the value of HBM is so high also. So I think there is a lot of factors. In many ways, there are plenty of opportunities. Then the other part of that, the answer is, making sure that our solutions actually are going to work for those opportunities, and we are still proving that out. Thanks Harlan. So let me unpack that a little bit. I think that -- it is definitely the case for gate-all-around that it creates new integration challenges and so we've seen, and we've talked about this for some time now, the adoption of Gen 4 to support that in a new configuration to be able to resolve the issues around that. So there is -- that's a driver. It is also a different approach than what customers have to use for the -- because of the architectural [change] (ph). There's more metrology intensity being used and largely an increase in the need to control voltage threshold. So VT control becomes more important. And so that's also a part of it. You also just have film thickness measurement and management hire. So overall, we would anticipate but that's all kind of rolled into how we model the increasing process control intensity that we've outlined before there is really nothing that's different than when we model that going forward toward our 2026 plan in terms of overall process control intensity and our share performance there. Yes. It still might not be the absolute dollar basis right? And then with the second half growing relative to the first half -- the percent will start to move in the second half versus the first half. But on an absolute dollar basis as I said last quarter, it's about flat. Now depending on what happens, you've got a lot of new projects and RevRec could be an issue with newer customers. So where it shows up in terms of which quarter, I'm not going to comment on. But if you just take a step back and look at a half-to-half point of view, it's very similar to what I said last quarter. Well, I think that the difference for high NA -- the most obvious difference is you are going to continue scaling. So you are going to get smaller defects and you're going to have new challenges associated with reticle qualification and that takes the form both in the [mass shop] (ph), and ReQual and in Print Check. So all those factors continue, but it is really an extension of the trends that we've seen. And when you get high NA, you'll get also just the mix will shift. You'll have some layers initially of high NA and then you'll have others that are going to be the 0.33. I think what we're hearing and seeing from customers is very consistent with what we believed in terms of when HVM happens. We don't see any acceleration in the timing. If anything, there's the potential for delay in terms of the HVM implementation, there will be characterization work happening before that. But like all technology transitions, we see the existing technology often extends longer and has more upgrades and it's more cost effective. And that's what drives customers ultimately, it's about the economics. And so I think what will happen is if they can do that, then they'll bias toward extending the life of the 0.33 and the efficacy of that in the leading edge and then high NA comes after. So nothing has really changed in our view. No acceleration, if anything, potential for some additional delay in the implementation. Yes. I think there is no question that the package market is growing, and it's for all the reasons that you hear, I think that there's been an acceleration. And again, I mentioned earlier in the call that some of the gaps, if you think about what's going on overall with AI or packaging shortage related. So there is a lot of investment happening there. Is it not -- it's not just macro, it's what historically would have been considered pretty advanced lithography not that -- or inspection not that many years ago because the design rules and the yield and the what's at risk, cost-wise is much higher. Many years ago, when we bought a company and started doing packaging, one of our customers ask, why are you even bothering, this is not a KLA market. What happened in the last year is now customers are saying, we need your capability that you have in the front end to be applied into some of our advanced packaging challenges and accelerated workshops with us talking about that accelerated product road maps and a lot of customer excitement and interest. So they're driving it very hard because they have shortages, and it is really across many of our products, both in our processing, but also in our process control. So it's been significant to see the growth and the speed of it. As we said, that's the annualized -- that's the annual number for calendar '24, but we'd expect the trend to continue towards growth in '25 and beyond. Just one final point. Some of our customers -- our competitors are coming at this from a lower end. And in many cases, the requirements are at the top end of their capability. And so what we're hearing from customers is, even though in some cases, they are buying our systems, what are at the bottom-end of our capability, what they also want is the road map. So I think they want the ability to buy that capability now the expectation and the knowledge that they can upgrade it over time as their requirements continue because you are now with that packaging. There is no question that road map is going to look more like a traditional scaling road map going forward. Thanks Krish. Some weakness in automotive. Sure. It is definitely not as high as what you would see on leading edge. But often in the case of you have small relatively size-wise small sites, then you are not really up against the percent against a huge number of wafer starts. So that's one factor. The other factor is some of the infrastructure that people are adding in terms of whether it is mask shops or wafer. So in aggregate, that's why it's for us, it's pretty much helps serve. Yes. Our forecasts are entirely independent of any [ChipPAC] (ph) money. There's no dependence on that. That if our customers receive that, it's going to be -- they're going to be getting it what they tell us is to offset cost of building fabs in places that are more expensive. But it's not contributing to that they are going to build capacity based on demand. The demand is just going to be based on their market, the overall market and then they'll buy equipment accordingly. But we are not counting on our customers get ChipPAC money to make our plans. Yes. We have not -- we're heavily involved in the reticle market. It's a market that really we started comparing with, and we're still involved in it heavily. The question on, do you need actinic inspection for reticles. It's been a long debate that we've had in our conclusion based on all the analysis that we've seen is the real market need for that is when high NA gets introduced because of the existing technology nodes, there's really three ways to deal with the problems. One is the challenges of reticle quality. One is the flagship product line that we've had for a long time, the 6xx accident extensions to that. The other one is an e-beam product that we've talked about that's being used for very high resolution. And right now, it is the highest sensitivity reticle inspection tool still in where -- with our customers, we are still in the characterization of that tool, that's the 8xx. And then the last one is printing onto wafers and verifying the goodness of the reticles and that's what we're using basically using the Gen 5 print check application for. When it comes to investment in the actinic or the product that we've identified for high NA, we're pretty confident of our ability to intercept the high volume manufacturing of high NA, which is still some years away. So we'll have all the specifics on that in the 10-K that we'll file here another week or two. It was pretty close to flat, down about $70 million quarter-on-quarter, so pretty flattish compared to last quarter. I think given what we're seeing in the funnel, I would expect it likely to probably over the next few quarters, we'll start to see it increase. But yes, just slightly down from last quarter. I'll let Bren deal with the specifics. This is Rick. But it's not just process control for us. It is also process tools because of the SPTS acquisition we did about five years ago. Well, one of the things we talked about a lot, Tim, and I know you know this, is the because of where we are with the AI drivers, we're seeing an acceleration at the leading edge. So if we think about what's really going to propel our business going forward, it's not so much the legacy, which has been may be overrepresented on historical levels the last few years. But it's the stuff we are seeing right now, especially at the leading edge in terms of leading-edge foundry, and that's been driving a lot of our business in our expectations around what we are seeing in N3 and N2, plus the packaging plus we're seeing in HBM. So if I think about \u201825, \u201826, those are going to be the things that drive KLA drive our performance and should drive good opportunities for our investors. Thank you Tim."

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated our market leadership combined with the consistent execution of our global team. KLA continued to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer's changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.57 billion above the guidance-based midpoint of $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.60 and GAAP diluted EPS was $6.18, both above their respective guidance midpoints. The gross margin was 62.5% at the upper end of the guidance range as a richer product mix than modeled and higher revenue volume drove upside to guidance. Operating expenses were $553 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $324 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41%. Other income and expense net was a $32 million expense and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.6%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $893 million, GAAP net income was $836 million, cash flow from operations was $893 million, and free cash flow was $832 million. The company had $135.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products, and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Moving to our outlook, we believe our business is transitioning from a period of stabilization to a resumption of growth, which began in our June quarter and we expect to continue through the remainder of Calendar 2024 and into 2025. For calendar 2024, we remain encouraged by the improvement in our customers revenue and profitability over the course of this year. This improvement will ultimately translate into new investment in capital equipment to support semiconductor growth over the medium-term. Our high-level outlook for the industry remains largely unchanged. Our expectation is for the WFE market to be in the mid $90 billion range and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. While it's too early to be overly specific on expectations for calendar 2025, we do expect a year of growth, fueled principally by growth and leading-edge investments in both Logic/Foundry and in memory. Given KLA's business momentum, we are confident in our relative performance opportunities moving forward. KLA's September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.75 billion plus or minus $150 million. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecast to be approximately 80%. And memory is expected to be approximately 20% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 83% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 17%. Gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as higher revenue volumes offset by weaker anticipated product mix. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on the current industry outlook, top-line growth expectations for calendar 2024, higher forecasted growth in services and expected system product mix, we are still modeling non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically guarded by product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses are forecasted in September quarter to be approximately $565 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $10 million to $15 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. This is supported by our revenue growth expectations and in-line with our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin business model. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include; other income and expense net of approximately $34 million expense, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $6.69 plus or minus $0.60, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135 million shares. In conclusion, our business has transitioned from a period of stabilization to one of growth. We remain optimistic that the indicators of improvement we have seen will continue throughout the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives which are geared to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence is what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of scaling and increasing complexity has solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control in enabling technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results in process integration and fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across a volume production environment with high semiconductor device design mix. This bodes-well for KLA's long-term growth outlook. The near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving, and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin Q&A. Kevin? No, I think you covered most of it Rick, I would say also 1 of the things that were encouraged by that with the design start environment given the high mix of parts, that our participation with our customers in terms of process control and monitoring that happens in production tends to be at a higher level. So they're trying to manage a robust design environment that's testing design rules in different ways, and that tends to be positive for continuous process control investment as they wrap the node. Well, 2024 is really a transition year for memory. We're not seeing a lot of growth overall. Some in the DRAM front and some investment that's happened in China. So I think from a WFE point of view, 2025 is when we expect to see more growth there. I think that you talked about the drivers, particularly around DRAM and HBM being drivers into next year. I think, as we see our customers' business models improve, and we are certainly seeing the financial performance improved with pricing going up, so significantly over the course of this year. But that will translate into investment as we move into next year. I think on the flash market, we're less bullish into next year, although it is operating off a pretty low level. We'll see as we get closer to it. But right now, we do see a recovery in both parts of it, but certainly led by more DRAM than flash on an absolute WFE basis. Yes, we feel pretty good, CJ. We are seeing relative performance this year, and this is a year that's still pretty heavy overall in what I'll call legacy levels of investment, particularly in China. So as we start to move to leading edge and you see the entry ramp and also the initial investments; and then two we would expect that given our position, particularly in certain markets that we expect to scale and grow much faster than the overall that we are pretty well positioned into next year to see foundry and logic leading edge investment drive KLA share of the overall spend. We were talking about DRAM and HBM. HBM is a device that tends to -- first of all, you have advanced DRAM, you have EUV as a -- you get the introduction of for use of EUV with those chips, but also as you start to put the chips together, it creates not only potential packaging opportunities moving forward, but you also have increased sampling to ensure that each of the DRAM die is functioning properly. So we've seen DRAM improve from a process control intensity point of view since the introduction of EUV. And so I would expect to see that continue as well as we move forward. So yes, I think we feel pretty good about the relative positioning of the company as we move into next year. Yes. It's a good question, Harlan. And you did cover all the advancements that have us pretty excited in terms of opportunity moving forward. We have seen intensity improve over the last couple of years or so. But what we are waiting for to lean in, if you will, into those -- to that improvement is to see a full cycle in terms of investment by our customers. And so I think as we look into next year, I think that where we are today is probably we're historically around 10% that were probably in excess of 11% today. And I think moving forward, if we can execute and deliver some of the products and capabilities we have in development here, I think it creates a number of opportunities covering the things that you talked about and some of the other things we talked about in the last question or two. Atif, if you look back to the last local high and KLA share WFE, it was when the industry transitioned from planar to FinFet structures. So typically, architecture changes do drive because of just the change that's happening and the immaturity of the change, it does drive process control intensity to a higher level. So historically, it is proven. So Rick talked about not only inspection opportunities, but you are depositing a lot more layers, 20% to 30% more critical layers on the metrology side. So we think in a number of areas, it is going to create opportunities. And you still have the scaling dynamics, while Litho layers are constant. Those are still pretty challenging layers in terms of -- from a defect control point of view. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunities. I think it's feeding into a lot of what we've said here over -- in the last few questions in terms of our confidence moving into next year. Yes, a function of higher revenues. It's about 5% or so. At some point, as we move through the different quarters and revenue ranges, we start to make an adjustment just because of the higher levels. So there is nothing indicative in that other than the revenue is up 9% higher and we decided to -- it was 9% in June and then the guidance, another 7%. So that it was prudent to raise the range. You have to also remember that we do have integers that are quite large. If you think about our broadband plasma systems, they could be anywhere even plus $20 million depending on the configuration. So tools moving in and out can have an impact in terms of our overall. So it's really more just the increasing revenue level and not related to anything else. Yes, Krish. On China, it looks -- like I said earlier, I think from a half-to-half point of view, it's relatively flat. So I don't see any real change. A lot of that's dependent on project timing given the level of greenfield activity that we're seeing there. As we move into next year, my early view on our business levels is more or less consistent with what we're seeing this year. I think when you look at the order funnel, what we have in backlog, what we have in deposits, gives me some confidence in terms of what we see into next year. So I don't see a change. Obviously, the mix could -- will be changing. There's infrastructure investments. It's obviously the logic/foundry memory and so on. But from an overall level, it seems that it is pretty consistent year-to-year. On gross margin, it -- while we outperformed in the June quarter, it was a little bit more than what we had initially modeled in the quarter. There is some investment that we're seeing in the September quarter from that. When you look at KLA gross margins, I talk a lot about product mix being the biggest driver of our gross margin in terms of variability quarter-to-quarter. It's not customer mix, it's not region mix. It is the portfolio mix and not all the products in our portfolio carry the same margin profile, but also within the product families themselves. And particularly when you're selling across multiple nodes with highly configurable systems, you can end up with bearing gross margin profile even within the same product families. So it's really a function of that than it is anything else. And of course, the June quarter was stronger. I did put the comments, which were very consistent with last quarter in terms of expectations for this year in the mid 61% range. That's our expectation. And then moving forward, as we see the business continue to grow into [2025] (ph), I think you'll see KLA's general incremental gross margin performance in and around that 65% incremental gross margin, plus or minus, as we move forward here. But in any given quarter, it could add a little bit of variability, but nothing that's different than what we usually see. Most of our growth has been more on the logic side. And I think one of the things we are excited about moving forward is that as you move in high-bandwidth memory to hybrid bonding techniques, they do increase the complexity of the process of fair amount. And as you know, the KLA position in the market is one of higher value offerings, supporting more complexity. And so we're encouraged by what those opportunities might look like as we get out into the into the '26 and '27 time frame. Obviously, the industry is thinking a lot about what's next in terms of panel level packaging and so on. And so there is obviously R&D that goes into that. But -- so that's work that we will be doing in the company. And so I think that those opportunities, to Rick's point, are just showcasing, I think what's the opportunities that are available in this part of the market over the next several years. Yes. So on those fronts so again, I don't want to guide December, but I think high single digit, low double digit is probably the right way to think about our performance for the year overall. So I think that as we saw in June relative to the expectations we had a few months ago, we did better than we thought September guide was higher, certainly higher than what consensus was. So I think the incremental optimism I talked about earlier in the funnel is revealing and some incremental growth here through the second half of the year. When I look at the overall mix of business, I think that foundry/logic is likely closer to 75%. So last year 70%-30% or approximate semiconductor process control shipments -- or revenue to semiconductor customers is closer to [75%, 25% and 24%] (ph). But we'll see how it ends up. Well, we are seeing more capacity come online. Those are products where we've been supply constrained certainly around Gen 4. So as new capacity comes online. I think it's one of the challenges for us frankly, back in 2023 as we were limited and as we move through this year, from a quarterly run rate point of view, we are getting incremental supply and that -- given the supply constraints and the level of demand, we are seeing growth there and would expect to see that continue into next year. So I'm fairly bullish on that part of the business growing faster than the overall market, both this year and next year. So I think that's one of those areas that I said earlier about our relative confidence in terms of share of the overall market is our presence in certain markets that are growing extremely fast relative to the overall and certainly high-end wafer inspection is one of those. DRAM was stronger in the first half and will be in the second half. I would expect that wafers probably a little weaker. I think on the reticle side, it is a little bit stronger. And then foundry/logic is stronger offsetting the weaker memory. Yes. So utilization rates are certainly a factor. So we've seen those steadily improve across all segments in the course of this year. And so that's been a driver of incremental revenue. The other thing, and we had pretty good visibility to this was the shipments that we -- or the tools that we shipped in '21 and '22, have come off of warranty and gone into contract. In our contract renewal or attach rate is about 95%. So as those tools go up a warranty into contract that that's a driver. So we've had pretty good visibility into the service business. We've had a headwind from FX because you do have some of the service revenue denominated in local currency particularly in Japan. So there's been some headwinds to the growth rate, frankly. But yes, we are trending towards that 14% sort of top part of the guidance range. And I think for the target we put out there. And I think as we go over the next couple of years, I feel like we are closer to the top end of the range than the bottom end of the range. Thank you Toshiya. Yes. We are a very little multinational business in China. And Joe, on the multinational question, I mean, most of that business is service, right? We're not really -- there's no real equipment business that's happening with our multinational customers there, but there is sort of this activity supporting those fabs. Yes. Look, we -- right now, our view is that this part of the market will grow faster than overall WFE. So if you look in the long run, as we expect WFE over the next few years, the capital intensity slowly rising to grow a little bit faster than semiconductor revenue that this part of the market will likely grow faster than that. So that's the only quantifying we've done at this point. To Rick's point, we have a broad portfolio, we are seeing parts of it on the inspection side move up market, but we also sell a number of process tools. We also sell some chemical process control capability as well. So we are approaching this market in multiple ways. And like I said I think that, as we talked about earlier, in the memory part of the market as it relates to HBM, we think we are better positioned relative to some of the technology transitions that are coming in terms of our share opportunity moving forward. Yes. On specialty semiconductor quarter-to-quarter, it dipped a little bit in the June quarter, but that's for the timing issue. I think our expectation in that business is still some modest growth for the year. That has -- that business has a pretty diversified market exposure. And as power semi related to automotive has come down. We've seen packaging pick up, but there's a little bit of a dip in June, but recovers and has a much stronger second half. Flat panel business is where we announced our exit of that, and so we still have revenue in our plans for that as we exit that business and would expect in the manufacturing likely in Q1 of 2025. On the PCB front, which is more consumer centric, we still have -- that market has been relatively sluggish, it is improved a bit, but not much. And that's obviously tied much more to mobility. And so improvements into the future as we see more cell phone unit growth will drive that business. Now there was -- that business had a very strong '21 and into '22, a lot of capacity added during that coded period. And so the industry is still working off some of that capacity. Now in that business, we do have service exposure. So you have pretty good contract penetration in the PCB world. So while the systems business has been slower, there have been service contributions from a revenue point of view that we've had over the last year or so. But I would think that overall the aggregate part of that business is up a few points year-to-year. I think it is -- we'll call low to mid-single digits. Well, there's still some new business from new customers. The other thing that's happening in China is you do see investment from our mature legacy customers in China. And so where we've been engaged in supporting those customers for many, many years. And their businesses are typically driven by supply for specific markets and in response to expectations of demand moving forward. So you do have those customers also investing more here, I think moving forward. And then you do move into second phases with certain ones, but there is also some new ones too. So it's a pretty broad mix as I look at the remainder of this year and into next year. Yes, Tim, I mean, there's been a lot of news for some time. And so you're right, I can't participate here in speculation and hypotheticals about what could or could not happen. So we will continue to assess, we're very closely with the US government. Of course, we do everything we need to do in the company to be in compliance. We will follow the laws we do, and we'll support our customers as well within the confines of whatever the regulations are. So if and when something happens, we'll assess the impact and let you know what the impact is in sort of the near term and what might be over the long term. If you go back to 2022, 75% plus of our business was what we'll call leading edge advanced design rules, 20-nanometer or below. So with the expectation of a ramp into next year from our leading-edge customers on the logic and memory side, we think that, that's going to drive the hundreds of our business as we move over the course of next year and beyond. Yes. I think based on the funnel that we will see -- I think the order profile looks pretty good. Now orders are not always indicative of what's going on given the number of customers and the size of the orders. And then when it comes to KLA, even the size of the ASPs of certain types of products. But all that being said, yes, it went from about $13 billion at its peak in terms of RPO down to just 10 today. So it's still quite large, but I would expect that moving forward that at least over the next couple of quarters, it looks that the order profile looks decent. So yes, I think that's a reasonable way to see it."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining our earnings call to discuss the March 2024 results and the June quarter outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace; and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references are to calendar years. Earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to the SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosures of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Today, I will review KLA's March quarter results, main highlights and address the new market share reports as well as a broader industry outlook. KLA's revenue of $2.36 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range. EPS results, both non-GAAP and GAAP, were above the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided on March 18 in conjunction with the decision to exit the flat panel business. Market conditions have stabilized, and we expect our business to improve as we progress through the year. We're encouraged by the improvement in our customers' business across multiple end markets, which is driving discussions with our customers about future opportunities for leading-edge capacity investments. At the start of each year, new global market share reports are published by third parties that provide additional insights into the state of our industry. These reports show consistent, long-term KLA market leadership in process control and demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio that offers our customers unique capabilities to address their technology challenges while meeting their productivity demands. This year, following significant gain in 2022, KLA's 2023 market share declined by nearly 1%, driven primarily by a loss in access to approximately 10% of the China market as a result of U.S. government export controls. That said, KLA's consistent market leadership in process control and some of the most critical markets in WFE reflect the success of our customer-focused strategies and the power of our portfolio. We're confident that KLA's quarterly revenues bottomed in the March quarter as expressed in our prior earnings call. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and slowly rising capital intensity continue to be a long-term tailwind. Additionally, the increasing complexity in advanced packaging applications for AI and other advanced technologies drive demand for both our process tool and process control products. Overall demand growth, along with increasing technology requirements will drive the need for more capability from inspection and metrology systems. Our advanced packaging business will generate approximately $400 million in run rate in 2024, and we expect this business to achieve growth rates meaningfully above the growth rate of WFE going forward. In services, our business grew to $590 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Quarterly free cash flow was $838 million, and the last 12 months free cash flow was $3.1 billion with a free cash flow margin of 32% over the period. KLA's quarterly results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and product strategies. Customers continue to prioritize and invest in leading-edge technology transition and this aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product road maps and preparing for growth at the leading edge. Bren will now discuss the financials and our outlook further.\nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated a consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show  resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.36 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.26, above the guidance midpoint of $4.83. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.43, above the guidance midpoint of $4.06. In the March quarter, both non-GAAP and GAAP diluted EPS were negatively impacted by a $62 million charge for excess and obsolete inventory related to the company's strategic decision to exit the flat panel display business announced on March 18. This charge had a $0.40 impact on EPS. Excluding this item, diluted non-GAAP EPS would have been $5.66. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, above the top end of the revised guidance range. Excluding the FPD charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 62.4% and roughly flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $544 million comprised of $320 million in R&D and $224 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP EPS at the 13.5% guided tax rate would have been $0.04 higher or $5.30. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36.8%. Non-GAAP other income and expense, net, was a $34 million expense and the quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $715 million, GAAP net income was $602 million. Cash flow from operations was $910 million, and free cash flow was $838 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. On February 1, KLA issued $500 million of 4.7% senior notes due in 2034 and $250 million of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052. The  company expects to use the net proceeds from the notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at or prior to maturity. Moving to our outlook. We remain encouraged by constructive customer discussions around their future investment plans, which are further supported by recent reports of an improving end market demand environment and customer profitability. Consistent with these industry trends, as we indicated in last quarter, we believe our business bottomed from a revenue perspective in the March quarter and looking ahead through the balance of calendar '24, growth is resuming in the June quarter, and we expect business levels to improve as we progress through the year. For calendar 2024, our high-level outlook remains unchanged. We still expect WFE demand to be roughly flat to modestly up from 2023 and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows: revenue of $2.5 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry/logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 82% and memory is expected to be 18% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 78% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 22%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in the range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point based on product mix expectations. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling non-GAAP gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the June quarter to be approximately $550 million as our merit adjustment process occurred in the March quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024, supported by expected revenue growth. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately $38 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $5.66, plus or minus $0.60. And a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.07, plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.4 million shares. In conclusion, as we articulated 12 weeks ago, we are encouraged with the indicators of improvement ranging from our customers' conversations to the public reports over the past few months. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology road map requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield across a high semiconductor device design mix, volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook as near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact in both legacy and leading-edge markets. That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Operator, can you please provide instructions for.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Last year and first half of this year was more mature node by spending maybe more infrastructure focused as well. As you step into the second half of this year, it does feel like advanced node momentum is starting to accelerate right, both foundry and logic and memory and -- appears to be reflected in your confidence on improving spending outlook for this calendar year. Given your relatively longer lead time, your critical role in enabling these advanced technology migrations, like how are customer discussions, the initial forecast visibility and outlook for calendar '25 shaping up for the team? I mean I assume it's a more advanced technology-driven profile next year, which should be good for the team, but wanted to get your views.\nRichard Wallace: Great. Harlan, thanks for the question. This is Rick. Absolutely, we are having different kind of discussions now than we've had for a while with our leading-edge logic and memory customers. As they prepare for the ramp and we're seeing increased demand for -- they are seeing increased demand, they're talking about tool availability, scheduling of resources, making sure that they don't get behind, really conversations we haven't had for a while. I think the build-outs are still -- as we indicated, we see kind of stability with rising demand through the year, but the real build-out is going to come in '25 and beyond that as we see some of the conversations we're having. So really good indicators, leading indicators, design starts, advanced node discussions, R&D work. So we feel pretty good about the setup.\nHarlan Sur: Great. And did you see the continued growth in the services business with industry utilizations clearly on an upward trajectory. You've got record number of tools coming off warranty customers, I think, wanting more value-added services and offerings just given the complexity challenges ahead? Has the view on the services growth profile improved relative to the last earnings call? I know you talked about being at the upper end of that sort of 12% to 14% sort of target range this year on the last call. Has that changed?\nBren Higgins: I would say -- Harlan, it's Bren. I would say, look, we're continuing to see very strong momentum, utilization rates are improving. We had a lot of tools come off of warranty, and they go into contract and our conversion rate is about 95%. So that's very positive. Customers are extending lives of the systems, which bodes well for long-term service growth overall. So I think as we track here, I think we feel pretty good about the range that we have, and we're closer to the upper end for sure than the lower end as we move forward over the next few years.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nChristopher Muse: I guess, first question, a near-term question on the mix you expect for June, which a pretty massive shift to foundry/logic from memory. So, I guess, as part of that, can you speak to some of the underlying drivers? And within that, do you see perhaps a pickup from domestic China memory beyond the June quarter? Or I think in the prior quarter, you talked about revenue rec pushed to the June quarter. So curious about the moving parts there.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. I would say as far as China memory goes, it's more first half heavy than second half, while we're having very positive conversations with our customers on the memory front, as Rick indicated, in terms of long-term plans, we're seeing their businesses now improve. We're seeing profitability and cash flow starting to improve. But we don't expect any significant investments as we move through the rest of the year. Nothings could change. But I think that the profile, it might tick up a little bit in the second half overall, non-China but I don't see it changing in a real meaningful way. If you look back at our business, we were a little bit over 70%, maybe logic/foundry in 2023. And I think we're going to be right around 70%. I think it's going to be pretty similar overall mix this year.\nChristopher Muse: Excellent. And then in terms of your commentary around accelerating top line revenues throughout the remainder of calendar '24. I guess, can you speak to the main drivers there as it relates to perhaps 2-nanometer pilot logic in Arizona handset-related EPC. What's really driving that? And is there sort of a percentage growth rate we should be thinking about half-on-half?\nBren Higgins: Yes. C.J., I think you covered most of them, right? We will see some early investment in 2-nanometer. You have the 3-nanometer build-out. You have the investment that you mentioned in Arizona. So those are all pretty good for logic/foundry segment. Right now, when I look at the overall business first half versus second half, I think the second half is high single digits versus the first half in that ballpark. We're not guiding, but I think it's going to end up in that range as we progress through the year. On EPC front, I think it is a little bit stronger. You do have some seasonality in EPC in the first part of the year. But we'll see some improvement there, I think, as we move through the second half of the year as well. And of course, service is growing quarter-on-quarter. So you've got that effect as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I have two of them. One is, Rick or Bren, last quarter, you kind of said that for KLA, the overall calendar '24 revenues could grow mid-single digits based on WFE. And obviously, some of these expectations that mid-single digits [indiscernible]. Given that you do have some exposure on that side, I'm just kind of curious how to think about your overall revenue profile for this year -- year-over-year? And then I have a follow-up.\nBren Higgins: Yes. So -- and when you look at the WFE level and when we talk about a flat to modestly up. And that, I think, depends on your view of WFE as everybody adds it up differently. Our view is that WFE was probably $90 billion to $91 billion, and then it's slightly up from there -- or flat to slightly up from there in terms of how we're looking at this year. So I think that's the way to think about it. Simply put, given that WFE is more or less flat to modestly up, that we were going to see this increase in service that we talked about, we're going to see some modest improvement in EPC. And we've seen some improvement given the outperformance we saw in March, the incremental guide into June in our semi PC business. So I think overall, semi PC share in the overall market is probably going to be fairly consistent, maybe a little bit up from what we saw in '23. And all that translates into our semi PC business roughly performing mostly in line with where we think the market is going to be for this year.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on China. Given your long lead times, I'm kind of curious how do you think about China? You did say memory would be first [ uprated ] overall China revenues? And along the same path, if I back out the FPD gross margins from March to June is down 90 basis points Q-over-Q. You said it's product mix? Is it mainly from China? I'm just kind of curious on this.\nBren Higgins: Yes. No, it's mostly product mix quarter-on-quarter, down from the FPD adjustment related to the inventory that we took related to the decision there. So it's mostly just product mix across our semi PC business. You do have some growth in service quarter-on-quarter and services is dilutive to the overall gross margin. We believe it's accretive to the operating margin, but the gross margin is a little dilutive. And then the rest is just the normal product mix we have across the portfolio. Different margin profiles across the portfolio. And so depending on what we're revenue in a given quarter, it can cause some fluctuation. But I think the guidance range is appropriate, like we saw -- I think we guided somewhere around 61.5% last quarter. It came in above 62%, depending on how things end up revenuing as we engage with customers and ship systems, there's always room for upside, which is why we give the range that we give. So there's nothing really particular to actual customers. It's more about the product mix of all regions. It's more about the product mix of the products we're shipping and getting acceptance.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Is China [ shipment ] for the rest of the year, similar range or?\nBren Higgins: So China is interesting. I think it's probably flattish over the course of the year. Second half is more or less flattish with the first half. The mix is changing a bit in terms of the end market mix. But we see it as a percent of the total come down as we see most of the growth in the year coming from our non-China customers.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Ask a few questions. I guess, it is sort of asked earlier, but with all these CHIPS Act announcements continuing to roll in, has this solidified the timing or magnitude of any of the U.S. greenfields build-out? Or maybe what is your latest thinking on some of these projects?\nRichard Wallace: Well, yes, there have been many announcements. It's exciting to see. But when you look at the timing for those projects, even, for example, the one that was announced today in New York, that one's quite a ways out. So I think the approval of the funding relative to the timing, the customers we talk to, they're excited about this, the chance to reshore under the U.S., but they're still building their capacity based on market demand. So it doesn't really affect the overall capacity investment. They're gauging that based on the overall demand. And I think what happens is -- it's the size of the investment in terms of how many wafer starts to add and what point is driven by the market. So we'd stick to the comments about when the -- what we seek for the business environment relatively independent of what location that the customers are choosing to make those investments.\nBrian Chin: Got it. That's fair. And then maybe I did notice that in the shareholder letter and on the call, you highlighted advanced packaging revenue could be around $400 million in calendar '24, what growth rate does that represent versus calendar '23? And then how would you size your served addressable market in advanced packaging, which I know certainly crosses, I guess, boundaries across your portfolio?\nBren Higgins: Yes. So it's greater than 25%. So we're somewhere down in around [ $300 million ] in '23 -- a little over [ $300 million ] and close to $400 million expectation for '24. It's across a broad portfolio, right? We have process control, which we sell to those customers, which is inspection of metrology, but also process tools in our specialty semiconductor business. It's about 50-50 in terms of the contribution from each part of the portfolio. And I think on the go forward, we feel pretty excited about the opportunity to see a growth rate that's meaningfully faster than WFE.\nRichard Wallace: Yes. And I think for opportunity, there's a couple of factors that are at play. One is the speed with which customers are accelerating their packaging efforts. The degree with which those are requiring leading edge. Our ability to make it make sense from a business standpoint, the packaging challenges really need to be leading edge. So there's still a number of packaging applications that are in markets that are served by lower-end competitors that we're not really competing for. So it has to do with how quickly the new technologies come on, but this has been an increased conversation in meetings that we've been having with leading customers for the last year or so. It was already talked about, but it's accelerating. So I think it's hard to judge exactly what the growth rate will be at this point. But it's pretty clear that there's a huge demand. And for many customers, they view it as the competitive necessity in order to -- there's very much of a race of getting that new capability into the market, especially as it pertains to some of the AI applications. So I would say that it's a huge driver for our customers we're engaged. There's a lot of requests for new capability and some of it comes down to us developing solutions in conjunction with those customers to meet those demands. But on its own as it stands right now, it will outgrow WFE and we think it has the potential to go well beyond that, depending on how the adoption goes and how we continue to execute against it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: I'm going to ask about N2, Rick. So -- there has been a lot of talk recently about the big volume in for N2 is not going to be probably until '26, although there will certainly be some customers -- crypto customers and whatnot that will ramp in '25. So there will be capacity that gets installed next year. So I guess my question is, how much of a driver do you think N2 will specifically be for your business? Are you seeing any of that yet? Is it more in the back half of this year thing? Is that -- so I'm just asking about like timing, when that starts to help your business?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. Great question. It is definitely being one of the conversations we're having with critical customers about timing. And we have seen -- part of our optimism going forward is those conversations are being pulled in, in terms of the needs because our customers are feeling end market pull. So I think you're right that it's -- the bulk of it -- the highest volume will be in '26. But for KLA we're already seeing those conversations, and we'll start to see some meaningful business in '25 for that with orders coming toward the end of '24 as customers figure it out. The other thing is we're seeing a number of advanced design starts for the 2-nanometer node. It's a big -- as you know, Tim, it's a big power favorable node. And so for a lot of customers, some of the challenges around data center and frankly, around AI are power related in terms of customers being able to even build those sites. So it's a big driver for our customers right now. So we think N2 is going to be a very significant node, and we're going to definitely see a lot of that. We're already seeing the activity, but it will be a big factor in '25 and then as we go through '25.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then I want to ask about China. Bren, you just said -- I think you said China is going to be flattish sort of in the back half of the year. I mean it sounds like every quarter China keeps getting stronger [indiscernible] I think it's going to downtick and it doesn't because they're just going to take tools of loans -- they're allowed to take tools. So my question is really just on the mix around China. Is this -- is the back half filling in a bit because of new customers? I mean there will be 30 to 40 new has been built, if not more than that, that are part of these big customer relationships under the names. And so is it these newly named fabs that are coming on that are sort of filling in the back half of the year? And then if we've seen a lot of headlines around potential entity list additions, if this happens, which there's been a lot of headlines about it. But if it does happen, is this downside to what you're thinking for the back half of the year or for next year?\nBren Higgins: Well, Tim, I don't want to speculate about hypotheticals about what might come or not come from the U.S. government in regards to further export controls, and we're continuing to work very closely with the government and spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that whatever the rules are that we're were compliant. It's a pretty decent mix. I talked about DRAM being down. I think the wafer infrastructure in the second half -- I think the wafer infrastructure is probably down a little bit in the second half. I think the reticle infrastructure is probably up, and then the logic/foundry is up overall. And when you net it all out, it's basically a flattish profile. The customer mix, you have -- you do have a number of new projects continuing to take systems, but you also have the -- I'll call them, the more mature legacy customers in China that are also part of that mix. So I think it's continuing to be healthy, I think, through this year. And I think the profile as we -- even beyond this year feels like it kind of continues more or less at current levels. Obviously, those are like half to half [indiscernible]  and in any given quarter, we'll see some movement. But that's how we see things today.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham.\nYu Shi: I want to ask a question to build on what was discussed with the team earlier. So TSMC definitely said that the revenue is going to ramp in 2026 for N2. And you kind of alluded to that, that you think the '26 volume for you will be higher than '25. But if I look at how the 3-nanometer ramps look like, and it occurred to me that 2022, which was minus 1 year in terms of production time line for the 3-nanometer was a higher volume for you guys compared with probably 2023. So I just really wonder the fact that you said you think that '26 will be a high volume for you compared with '25? Was that coming from some discussion with the customers? And what's changed this time, why they want,  kind of I mean, move the capacity to a little bit closer to the high volume at the point of entry to the high-volume production?\nRichard Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. And there's a couple of things to consider when thinking about N2. First of all, this is now very clear in our customers' minds a race for AI capability. And so you see several design starts happening, not just the ones we're most familiar with, but other players too design for capability. So you have a very different demand environment. You also have a constrained capacity environment now constrained somewhat even by the ability to build facilities. But the last factor is you have the KLA phenomenon as we get pulled in early. So we're front-end loaded into some of these facilities because you need our systems to be able to qualify the rest. So it is a different node than what we've seen in quite a while because of those factors. And there -- as we meet with customers, they are very concerned about supporting the demand that they're seeing. That's why we believe we're going to get a lot of pressure to support the end of this calendar year to start supporting some of the POs that we're going to see as they plan out those nodes, and it will go through -- and we're talking about volume in '26 for them, but toward the end of '25 is when we'll be seeing more and more of that business. And of course, we don't know how much broader it's going to get in terms of the number of design starts. It is remarkable that there are this many designs specifically for 1 application at this point in the process, but it's pretty remarkably consistent as we talk to different customers and even their customers.\nYu Shi: Maybe a second question, I want to ask you about the advanced packaging capability you're building there, it sounds like you're having more of the constructive conversation with your customers maybe to put more of KLA's more advanced process control capabilities into the packaging side of the process control. So I get the overall idea, but just really hopeful you can provide a little bit more color. What kind of areas do you think the customers are facing challenges in terms of maybe ramping up CoWos, maybe wrapping up SoIC. And where do you see from process control perspective, the biggest opportunities for KLA?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. I'll give you some color just from 2 stories. One, years ago when we bought ICOS, part of the theory of that case was it was giving us exposure to the back end. And I remember meeting with one of our big customers and their back-end people, and they literally said to me, why are you guys talking to us about the back end, that's not a KLA market. And fast forward to the end of last year -- calendar year in a meeting that Martin and I had with a critical customer, they had 2 topics that we needed to talk about. One was our support of EUV and the ramping of -- continuous ramping of EUV designs and capabilities and the other was advanced packaging. And these are the folks that were historically and traditionally responsible for the front end. And one of the things they said is we think you guys have the capability in a lot of your front-end tools but we need that modified and we need to have for the back end because the back end is a critical part of our differentiation, and that's the part that we need you to work with us to take what you consider front-end tools and make it -- and what we're more concerned with the cost and this is often the case at the beginning of a node. They're more concerned with capability and then they were necessarily on cost. So the dynamic has shifted pretty considerably. And again, I go to one of the biggest drivers for all this is all the work that's going on with AI. And if you look at the success and the requirement to have advanced packaging as part of those solutions, that's what's driving it. So we kind of anticipated a few years ago this [ more than more trend ] was going to become more and more relevant. But we're seeing it very specifically with customers bringing front-end people that they've worked in the front end, having them work on these back-end challenges and asking specifically for capability that we have in the front end to be used in the back end. And in some cases, we've done that with some of our inspection tools and capability. But as you know, we have to make modifications to handling and some of the operating conditions to make that work. So we're definitely seeing that, and in some cases, our ability to support and modify those systems will be the gating item for us to realize revenue on it, not the demand. The demand is there. And from a competitive standpoint, we're uniquely positioned to do that. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity, and it's a major focus area for the company.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.\nChristopher Caso: This is a follow-up question with regard to memory. And I think I understand what you're saying with regard to this year, perhaps some improvement in non-China memory, but nothing significant. I guess, what are your customers telling you to be prepared for perhaps as you're going into next year. We're starting to see some prices go up, utilization up. What's your expectation for the potential improvement in '25?\nBren Higgins: Yes, Chris, you're seeing all the things you want to see, right? You're seeing pricing improve, customers are taking up utilization. Utilizations were very low. And so there's a fair amount of capacity that's been out there. We're seeing the profitability improve and ultimately, that will translate into cash flow and then what we expect to be investment next year. I think we're seeing more in DRAM driven by the leading edge of DRAM or expect to see more there. And then, of course, the drivers related to its high bandwidth memory. But I think in some ways, it's the device market -- part of the market is improving this year, and that will translate into investment next year.\nChristopher Caso: Got it. As a follow-up, with regard to service, I think last quarter, you talked about your expectation that being kind of the high end of a 12% to 14% target. Is that still the right way of thinking about it? Again, we've seen utilization rates improve here. Does that make -- does that change your view of where services come out for the year?\nBren Higgins: Well, it's certainly a factor in the growth that we're seeing this year. So I've been pretty open that I thought that we'd be somewhere between $250 million to $300 million of incremental service this year versus in 2023. And I think we're closer to the top end of that range than the bottom. So it is a factor. And given the nature of process control and the complexity of our systems, the mix and the relatively lower volume, our customers tend to rely on us to ensure that they're optimizing their capital, particularly in environments when capital is constrained, yields matter a lot. And so our utilizations never drop as much as process tools where they have more redundancy, but we are seeing it continue to improve. And so I think it's a good sign in terms of the overall market health and our confidence about some of the growth drivers into next year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.\nJoseph Quatrochi: Wondering if you can tell me, obviously, you seem pretty positive in terms of just the opportunity looking into next year and thinking about the size of N2 and recovery in the memory market, I guess, how does the conversation with your customers over the last several months and just thinking about your lead times to give you confidence in your ability to reach that 2026 target model?\nBren Higgins: Well, I think our confidence is pretty good. We've made a lot of investments around the company in '21 and '22, both in terms of our own capacity, but also to ensure that our key suppliers have the capacity to support that kind of demand environment. So we -- it's one of the reasons why my inventory levels today are higher than -- and they continue to grow even where the market has corrected some because of the commitments we've made to ensure that the suppliers keep that capacity in place. So we feel very good about our ability to leverage what we have. I don't think we really have to make a lot of big investments to be able to support that trajectory. And I think we'll -- because of the investments, I think, frankly, they're a little bit of a headwind today in terms of the margins. So I think over time, the leverage opportunity is also compelling if we see the kind of growth environment that we expect over the next couple of years.\nJoseph Quatrochi: Okay. As a quick follow-up, Bren, I was wondering if you could give us RPO exiting the quarter?\nBren Higgins: It wouldn't be a quarterly conference call without your question, Joe. So [ 9.9-ish ] we're going to file the Q in the morning or sometime tomorrow, I think, $9.9 billion. It was down about $750 million quarter-on-quarter. Deposits are about $677 million.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\nThomas O'Malley: I think there's been a lot of discussion on the call about advanced packaging, and you guys have talked about how you had conversations already about potentially bringing some of your solutions from the front end to the back end. There's obviously some adjustments to those tools to get them ready. Can you talk about the timing of bringing those solutions there? Obviously, you're seeing a big growth rate in the back end. But from the moment that you say, hey, we want to take a tool and address the back end to when you're actually selling that to a customer. Can you talk about how long that takes?\nRichard Wallace: Sure. And we had -- yes, let's be clear. I mean we have some of our products already from the front end that are being used in the back end. That started a while ago. We're just seeing an accelerated conversation about more tools where some customers will actually name specific tools that they want. So it very much depends on the tool and I can give you a range where it could be from 3 months, it could be a couple of years depending on whether you're modifying something that's already being used in that kind of application and specializing it. So it really depends. But I do think that -- we have some that are already there. So part of our $400 million is from tools that were from the front end. It's amount of -- probably half of those is actually in some of process capabilities from SPTS. So it's really -- those are examples where we have it. And then -- also the case is some of those tools need to be upgraded to the later specifications as customers move forward in technology. So that's why, net-net, it's a positive. It's a growth segment for us. We think it will continue to grow. Bren talked about the growth from last year, and it was a big driver for going back in time for the Orbotech acquisition was our belief that packaging opportunity was going to continue to grow. So that's where we are on it. But it's very tool-specific how long it takes to modify.\nBren Higgins: We also have new products that are going to support the substrate transition as the substrate integrates into the package. On the inspection side as the lines and spaces shrink in the connecting layers. It will drive the need for more capability for more advanced inspection and metrology systems. And so any time you add sensitivity, you add capability, there tends to be a throughput or a volume hit, so it creates an opportunity for us to sell higher ASP systems so they have more capability, but if you're going to maintain the same sampling rate, then you will need more systems. So it's all a factor in terms of all these factors that are all positive in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunities.\nThomas O'Malley: Super helpful. And then my second one is just kind of on the [indiscernible] that you've given for the year. So you said second half over first half, high single digits and you talked about kind of the mix of foundry/logic being similar to calendar year '23, about that 70%. If you take those clues, you obviously see some really strong growth in memory in the second half. Could you just help us with any color, obviously, from March to June, your DRAM percentage went down a bit in terms of its contribution to memory. But in the second half, how should we be thinking about the DRAM and NAND growth profile?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I think I don't think it's going to -- it will be a little bit stronger potentially in the second half than the first, but not much because like I said earlier that expected DRAM investments in China, I would expect in the second half to be lower than the first half.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Sorry, I joined a little late, so if these questions have already been asked, I apologize. But I think last quarter, Bren, you had a customer push out that kind of impacted your revenue for the year. I'm just wondering if there's any change or any update to that customer if you're including that in the current year's guidance?\nBren Higgins: Yes, it affected the March quarter as we had some shifting around, frankly, affected a little bit the December quarter and the March quarter, but the shifting around to make the December quarter work, obviously, the shortfall was in March. So I don't think anything has really changed. I don't expect to see much activity from that customer until we get into '25. I mean, look, things could change, we could see some surprise. But right now, at least from a planning point of view, we put it in '25, and if it pulls in great, we can support it.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Got it. And then  on the 2 nanometer, I think your foundry customers are transitioning aggressively to get all around. Obviously, that helps you, but at the same time, I think the EUV layer count is going to be somewhat flattish. So I'm just wondering what sort of impact kind of it will have on process control intensity if you go to GAA and keep the, I guess, EUV kind of flattish in terms of layers,  should we expect any impact? Or is it kind of a nonevent for you?\nRichard Wallace: It's an event. I mean, our customers are definitely -- so you think about the dynamic, our customers don't want to add process control intensity if they can avoid it, they also want to ramp and yield. So those are the -- that's the trade-off. So in the prototyping stage or the early pilot, they inspect more and they measure more in order to debug the process, if you will, and ramp it. And the question is how much do they have to maintain when they ramp and that's really what drives process control. They're definitely using more capability at the front end and there are some areas where they're going to have to increase their sampling or measurement to keep up with the additional challenges of smaller design node. And there's also some new capability to have to bring because of FinFET. And so we've talked in the past about modifications of a Gen 4 optical inspector to be able to support the FinFET. But it's not the only change in that process. So the EUV layers matter, but the process integration challenges are still going to be there. When we model it, though we do see an increase, we have different scenarios for how much process control intensity will go up. But it's consistent with -- we think there'll be a modest increase in the overall process control intensity for the leaders who have been successfully doing 3 nanometers. Anybody else that tries to jump to that node though, will see a dramatic increase in their process control intensity because they don't benefit from the learning of having done 3n volume. So in aggregate, depending on how many people are supporting it over time, it will drive our intensity up for our customers. We're also expecting a more robust design environment, certainly in the first few years than what we saw at 3-nanometer and likely a steeper ramp. So in addition to the challenges of just the gate-all-around architecture, what it means from inspection but also metrology, but also more volume, earlier steeper ramp and a more robust design environment, which will challenge the customers' process integration more than you see when you just have a few designs. So we're encouraged on a number of front.\nOperator: We'll take another question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, I just had a follow-up on gate all around. Clearly, you have exposure to your Gen 4 optical inspection and the metrology for High-K metal gate. Is there a way to quantify what you think your gate-all-around revenues could be in calendar '24?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. I'd be making it up, Chris. I mean we haven't -- we don't really look at it that and we do think about what is the node requirement. So from that standpoint, if you think N2, you'd attribute it all to gate-all-around. So we think about node intensity for process control and blended. And as I said in the prior answer, that's slightly up, but we don't have a specific number specifically around gate-all-round. But obviously, that's the big driver for the change and why customers are pushing for N2. And we don't know yet, but that's consistent with the 2026 model that we've had where we see rising process control intensity corresponding increase per share for KLA.\nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just like if I can squeeze one more in. Just kind of curious about your Gen 4 lead times. I think last time you said it was 7 to 9 months. Has it changed? If you assume that mature node is kind of slowing, China might moderate as the year progresses. Is there a view that the lead times are coming in? Or is it still like 7 to 9 months?\nBren Higgins: Gen 4 is highly demanded across nodes. It's a very configurable system. And in fact, we recently introduced a non-upgradable version specifically for gate-all-around.  So, it's a product that has a lot of extendibility. It's been challenged in terms of supply -- the ability to get supply to meet demand. I would say -- and we will see some increase this year in revenue from that system, which it hurt us last year just because we weren't able to get any incremental supply around key components. I'll see that increase this year. And so that will help. I still think lead times are probably in the 18- to 24-month range for that product, although we do a lot of juggling to make sure that we're in a position to support all of our customers. But it has demand on multiple fronts, and I think it's a testament to its extendability and the favorability of a broadband system, which has the ability to scale the [ wafer plants ]  to meet very different inspection requirements across multiple nodes.\nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Krish. And I do think, Krish, you were referring to what we said about Gen 5, the 7 to 9 months a quarter ago, Bren. So I don't know on Gen 5, if there's any change there, but.\nBren Higgins: Gen 5 is in the same ballpark.\nRichard Wallace: All right. So that brings us to the end of our call. We want to thank everyone for your time and attention. We know it's a very busy day. With that, I will pass the call back over to our operator, to conclude.\nOperator: This does conclude the KLA Corporation March 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Today, I will review KLA's March quarter results, main highlights and address the new market share reports as well as a broader industry outlook. KLA's revenue of $2.36 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range. EPS results, both non-GAAP and GAAP, were above the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided on March 18 in conjunction with the decision to exit the flat panel business. Market conditions have stabilized, and we expect our business to improve as we progress through the year. We're encouraged by the improvement in our customers' business across multiple end markets, which is driving discussions with our customers about future opportunities for leading-edge capacity investments. At the start of each year, new global market share reports are published by third parties that provide additional insights into the state of our industry. These reports show consistent, long-term KLA market leadership in process control and demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio that offers our customers unique capabilities to address their technology challenges while meeting their productivity demands. This year, following significant gain in 2022, KLA's 2023 market share declined by nearly 1%, driven primarily by a loss in access to approximately 10% of the China market as a result of U.S. government export controls. That said, KLA's consistent market leadership in process control and some of the most critical markets in WFE reflect the success of our customer-focused strategies and the power of our portfolio. We're confident that KLA's quarterly revenues bottomed in the March quarter as expressed in our prior earnings call. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and slowly rising capital intensity continue to be a long-term tailwind. Additionally, the increasing complexity in advanced packaging applications for AI and other advanced technologies drive demand for both our process tool and process control products. Overall demand growth, along with increasing technology requirements will drive the need for more capability from inspection and metrology systems. Our advanced packaging business will generate approximately $400 million in run rate in 2024, and we expect this business to achieve growth rates meaningfully above the growth rate of WFE going forward. In services, our business grew to $590 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Quarterly free cash flow was $838 million, and the last 12 months free cash flow was $3.1 billion with a free cash flow margin of 32% over the period. KLA's quarterly results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and product strategies. Customers continue to prioritize and invest in leading-edge technology transition and this aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product road maps and preparing for growth at the leading edge. Bren will now discuss the financials and our outlook further. Great. Harlan, thanks for the question. This is Rick. Absolutely, we are having different kind of discussions now than we've had for a while with our leading-edge logic and memory customers. As they prepare for the ramp and we're seeing increased demand for -- they are seeing increased demand, they're talking about tool availability, scheduling of resources, making sure that they don't get behind, really conversations we haven't had for a while. I think the build-outs are still -- as we indicated, we see kind of stability with rising demand through the year, but the real build-out is going to come in '25 and beyond that as we see some of the conversations we're having. So really good indicators, leading indicators, design starts, advanced node discussions, R&D work. So we feel pretty good about the setup. Yes. I would say as far as China memory goes, it's more first half heavy than second half, while we're having very positive conversations with our customers on the memory front, as Rick indicated, in terms of long-term plans, we're seeing their businesses now improve. We're seeing profitability and cash flow starting to improve. But we don't expect any significant investments as we move through the rest of the year. Nothings could change. But I think that the profile, it might tick up a little bit in the second half overall, non-China but I don't see it changing in a real meaningful way. If you look back at our business, we were a little bit over 70%, maybe logic/foundry in 2023. And I think we're going to be right around 70%. I think it's going to be pretty similar overall mix this year. Well, yes, there have been many announcements. It's exciting to see. But when you look at the timing for those projects, even, for example, the one that was announced today in New York, that one's quite a ways out. So I think the approval of the funding relative to the timing, the customers we talk to, they're excited about this, the chance to reshore under the U.S., but they're still building their capacity based on market demand. So it doesn't really affect the overall capacity investment. They're gauging that based on the overall demand. And I think what happens is -- it's the size of the investment in terms of how many wafer starts to add and what point is driven by the market. So we'd stick to the comments about when the -- what we seek for the business environment relatively independent of what location that the customers are choosing to make those investments. Yes. And I think for opportunity, there's a couple of factors that are at play. One is the speed with which customers are accelerating their packaging efforts. The degree with which those are requiring leading edge. Our ability to make it make sense from a business standpoint, the packaging challenges really need to be leading edge. So there's still a number of packaging applications that are in markets that are served by lower-end competitors that we're not really competing for. So it has to do with how quickly the new technologies come on, but this has been an increased conversation in meetings that we've been having with leading customers for the last year or so. It was already talked about, but it's accelerating. So I think it's hard to judge exactly what the growth rate will be at this point. But it's pretty clear that there's a huge demand. And for many customers, they view it as the competitive necessity in order to -- there's very much of a race of getting that new capability into the market, especially as it pertains to some of the AI applications. So I would say that it's a huge driver for our customers we're engaged. There's a lot of requests for new capability and some of it comes down to us developing solutions in conjunction with those customers to meet those demands. But on its own as it stands right now, it will outgrow WFE and we think it has the potential to go well beyond that, depending on how the adoption goes and how we continue to execute against it. Yes. Great question. It is definitely being one of the conversations we're having with critical customers about timing. And we have seen -- part of our optimism going forward is those conversations are being pulled in, in terms of the needs because our customers are feeling end market pull. So I think you're right that it's -- the bulk of it -- the highest volume will be in '26. But for KLA we're already seeing those conversations, and we'll start to see some meaningful business in '25 for that with orders coming toward the end of '24 as customers figure it out. The other thing is we're seeing a number of advanced design starts for the 2-nanometer node. It's a big -- as you know, Tim, it's a big power favorable node. And so for a lot of customers, some of the challenges around data center and frankly, around AI are power related in terms of customers being able to even build those sites. So it's a big driver for our customers right now. So we think N2 is going to be a very significant node, and we're going to definitely see a lot of that. We're already seeing the activity, but it will be a big factor in '25 and then as we go through '25. Yes, it's a great question. And there's a couple of things to consider when thinking about N2. First of all, this is now very clear in our customers' minds a race for AI capability. And so you see several design starts happening, not just the ones we're most familiar with, but other players too design for capability. So you have a very different demand environment. You also have a constrained capacity environment now constrained somewhat even by the ability to build facilities. But the last factor is you have the KLA phenomenon as we get pulled in early. So we're front-end loaded into some of these facilities because you need our systems to be able to qualify the rest. So it is a different node than what we've seen in quite a while because of those factors. And there -- as we meet with customers, they are very concerned about supporting the demand that they're seeing. That's why we believe we're going to get a lot of pressure to support the end of this calendar year to start supporting some of the POs that we're going to see as they plan out those nodes, and it will go through -- and we're talking about volume in '26 for them, but toward the end of '25 is when we'll be seeing more and more of that business. And of course, we don't know how much broader it's going to get in terms of the number of design starts. It is remarkable that there are this many designs specifically for 1 application at this point in the process, but it's pretty remarkably consistent as we talk to different customers and even their customers. Yes. I'll give you some color just from 2 stories. One, years ago when we bought ICOS, part of the theory of that case was it was giving us exposure to the back end. And I remember meeting with one of our big customers and their back-end people, and they literally said to me, why are you guys talking to us about the back end, that's not a KLA market. And fast forward to the end of last year -- calendar year in a meeting that Martin and I had with a critical customer, they had 2 topics that we needed to talk about. One was our support of EUV and the ramping of -- continuous ramping of EUV designs and capabilities and the other was advanced packaging. And these are the folks that were historically and traditionally responsible for the front end. And one of the things they said is we think you guys have the capability in a lot of your front-end tools but we need that modified and we need to have for the back end because the back end is a critical part of our differentiation, and that's the part that we need you to work with us to take what you consider front-end tools and make it -- and what we're more concerned with the cost and this is often the case at the beginning of a node. They're more concerned with capability and then they were necessarily on cost. So the dynamic has shifted pretty considerably. And again, I go to one of the biggest drivers for all this is all the work that's going on with AI. And if you look at the success and the requirement to have advanced packaging as part of those solutions, that's what's driving it. So we kind of anticipated a few years ago this [ more than more trend ] was going to become more and more relevant. But we're seeing it very specifically with customers bringing front-end people that they've worked in the front end, having them work on these back-end challenges and asking specifically for capability that we have in the front end to be used in the back end. And in some cases, we've done that with some of our inspection tools and capability. But as you know, we have to make modifications to handling and some of the operating conditions to make that work. So we're definitely seeing that, and in some cases, our ability to support and modify those systems will be the gating item for us to realize revenue on it, not the demand. The demand is there. And from a competitive standpoint, we're uniquely positioned to do that. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity, and it's a major focus area for the company. Sure. And we had -- yes, let's be clear. I mean we have some of our products already from the front end that are being used in the back end. That started a while ago. We're just seeing an accelerated conversation about more tools where some customers will actually name specific tools that they want. So it very much depends on the tool and I can give you a range where it could be from 3 months, it could be a couple of years depending on whether you're modifying something that's already being used in that kind of application and specializing it. So it really depends. But I do think that -- we have some that are already there. So part of our $400 million is from tools that were from the front end. It's amount of -- probably half of those is actually in some of process capabilities from SPTS. So it's really -- those are examples where we have it. And then -- also the case is some of those tools need to be upgraded to the later specifications as customers move forward in technology. So that's why, net-net, it's a positive. It's a growth segment for us. We think it will continue to grow. Bren talked about the growth from last year, and it was a big driver for going back in time for the Orbotech acquisition was our belief that packaging opportunity was going to continue to grow. So that's where we are on it. But it's very tool-specific how long it takes to modify. It's an event. I mean, our customers are definitely -- so you think about the dynamic, our customers don't want to add process control intensity if they can avoid it, they also want to ramp and yield. So those are the -- that's the trade-off. So in the prototyping stage or the early pilot, they inspect more and they measure more in order to debug the process, if you will, and ramp it. And the question is how much do they have to maintain when they ramp and that's really what drives process control. They're definitely using more capability at the front end and there are some areas where they're going to have to increase their sampling or measurement to keep up with the additional challenges of smaller design node. And there's also some new capability to have to bring because of FinFET. And so we've talked in the past about modifications of a Gen 4 optical inspector to be able to support the FinFET. But it's not the only change in that process. So the EUV layers matter, but the process integration challenges are still going to be there. When we model it, though we do see an increase, we have different scenarios for how much process control intensity will go up. But it's consistent with -- we think there'll be a modest increase in the overall process control intensity for the leaders who have been successfully doing 3 nanometers. Anybody else that tries to jump to that node though, will see a dramatic increase in their process control intensity because they don't benefit from the learning of having done 3n volume. So in aggregate, depending on how many people are supporting it over time, it will drive our intensity up for our customers. We're also expecting a more robust design environment, certainly in the first few years than what we saw at 3-nanometer and likely a steeper ramp. So in addition to the challenges of just the gate-all-around architecture, what it means from inspection but also metrology, but also more volume, earlier steeper ramp and a more robust design environment, which will challenge the customers' process integration more than you see when you just have a few designs. So we're encouraged on a number of front. Yes. I'd be making it up, Chris. I mean we haven't -- we don't really look at it that and we do think about what is the node requirement. So from that standpoint, if you think N2, you'd attribute it all to gate-all-around. So we think about node intensity for process control and blended. And as I said in the prior answer, that's slightly up, but we don't have a specific number specifically around gate-all-round. But obviously, that's the big driver for the change and why customers are pushing for N2. And we don't know yet, but that's consistent with the 2026 model that we've had where we see rising process control intensity corresponding increase per share for KLA. Thank you, Krish. And I do think, Krish, you were referring to what we said about Gen 5, the 7 to 9 months a quarter ago, Bren. So I don't know on Gen 5, if there's any change there, but. All right. So that brings us to the end of our call. We want to thank everyone for your time and attention. We know it's a very busy day. With that, I will pass the call back over to our operator, to conclude."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated a consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show  resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.36 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.26, above the guidance midpoint of $4.83. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.43, above the guidance midpoint of $4.06. In the March quarter, both non-GAAP and GAAP diluted EPS were negatively impacted by a $62 million charge for excess and obsolete inventory related to the company's strategic decision to exit the flat panel display business announced on March 18. This charge had a $0.40 impact on EPS. Excluding this item, diluted non-GAAP EPS would have been $5.66. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, above the top end of the revised guidance range. Excluding the FPD charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 62.4% and roughly flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $544 million comprised of $320 million in R&D and $224 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP EPS at the 13.5% guided tax rate would have been $0.04 higher or $5.30. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36.8%. Non-GAAP other income and expense, net, was a $34 million expense and the quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $715 million, GAAP net income was $602 million. Cash flow from operations was $910 million, and free cash flow was $838 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. On February 1, KLA issued $500 million of 4.7% senior notes due in 2034 and $250 million of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052. The  company expects to use the net proceeds from the notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at or prior to maturity. Moving to our outlook. We remain encouraged by constructive customer discussions around their future investment plans, which are further supported by recent reports of an improving end market demand environment and customer profitability. Consistent with these industry trends, as we indicated in last quarter, we believe our business bottomed from a revenue perspective in the March quarter and looking ahead through the balance of calendar '24, growth is resuming in the June quarter, and we expect business levels to improve as we progress through the year. For calendar 2024, our high-level outlook remains unchanged. We still expect WFE demand to be roughly flat to modestly up from 2023 and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows: revenue of $2.5 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry/logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 82% and memory is expected to be 18% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 78% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 22%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in the range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point based on product mix expectations. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling non-GAAP gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the June quarter to be approximately $550 million as our merit adjustment process occurred in the March quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024, supported by expected revenue growth. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately $38 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $5.66, plus or minus $0.60. And a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.07, plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.4 million shares. In conclusion, as we articulated 12 weeks ago, we are encouraged with the indicators of improvement ranging from our customers' conversations to the public reports over the past few months. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology road map requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield across a high semiconductor device design mix, volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook as near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact in both legacy and leading-edge markets. That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. I would say -- Harlan, it's Bren. I would say, look, we're continuing to see very strong momentum, utilization rates are improving. We had a lot of tools come off of warranty, and they go into contract and our conversion rate is about 95%. So that's very positive. Customers are extending lives of the systems, which bodes well for long-term service growth overall. So I think as we track here, I think we feel pretty good about the range that we have, and we're closer to the upper end for sure than the lower end as we move forward over the next few years. Yes. C.J., I think you covered most of them, right? We will see some early investment in 2-nanometer. You have the 3-nanometer build-out. You have the investment that you mentioned in Arizona. So those are all pretty good for logic/foundry segment. Right now, when I look at the overall business first half versus second half, I think the second half is high single digits versus the first half in that ballpark. We're not guiding, but I think it's going to end up in that range as we progress through the year. On EPC front, I think it is a little bit stronger. You do have some seasonality in EPC in the first part of the year. But we'll see some improvement there, I think, as we move through the second half of the year as well. And of course, service is growing quarter-on-quarter. So you've got that effect as well. Yes. So -- and when you look at the WFE level and when we talk about a flat to modestly up. And that, I think, depends on your view of WFE as everybody adds it up differently. Our view is that WFE was probably $90 billion to $91 billion, and then it's slightly up from there -- or flat to slightly up from there in terms of how we're looking at this year. So I think that's the way to think about it. Simply put, given that WFE is more or less flat to modestly up, that we were going to see this increase in service that we talked about, we're going to see some modest improvement in EPC. And we've seen some improvement given the outperformance we saw in March, the incremental guide into June in our semi PC business. So I think overall, semi PC share in the overall market is probably going to be fairly consistent, maybe a little bit up from what we saw in '23. And all that translates into our semi PC business roughly performing mostly in line with where we think the market is going to be for this year. Yes. No, it's mostly product mix quarter-on-quarter, down from the FPD adjustment related to the inventory that we took related to the decision there. So it's mostly just product mix across our semi PC business. You do have some growth in service quarter-on-quarter and services is dilutive to the overall gross margin. We believe it's accretive to the operating margin, but the gross margin is a little dilutive. And then the rest is just the normal product mix we have across the portfolio. Different margin profiles across the portfolio. And so depending on what we're revenue in a given quarter, it can cause some fluctuation. But I think the guidance range is appropriate, like we saw -- I think we guided somewhere around 61.5% last quarter. It came in above 62%, depending on how things end up revenuing as we engage with customers and ship systems, there's always room for upside, which is why we give the range that we give. So there's nothing really particular to actual customers. It's more about the product mix of all regions. It's more about the product mix of the products we're shipping and getting acceptance. So China is interesting. I think it's probably flattish over the course of the year. Second half is more or less flattish with the first half. The mix is changing a bit in terms of the end market mix. But we see it as a percent of the total come down as we see most of the growth in the year coming from our non-China customers. Yes. So it's greater than 25%. So we're somewhere down in around [ $300 million ] in '23 -- a little over [ $300 million ] and close to $400 million expectation for '24. It's across a broad portfolio, right? We have process control, which we sell to those customers, which is inspection of metrology, but also process tools in our specialty semiconductor business. It's about 50-50 in terms of the contribution from each part of the portfolio. And I think on the go forward, we feel pretty excited about the opportunity to see a growth rate that's meaningfully faster than WFE. Well, Tim, I don't want to speculate about hypotheticals about what might come or not come from the U.S. government in regards to further export controls, and we're continuing to work very closely with the government and spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that whatever the rules are that we're were compliant. It's a pretty decent mix. I talked about DRAM being down. I think the wafer infrastructure in the second half -- I think the wafer infrastructure is probably down a little bit in the second half. I think the reticle infrastructure is probably up, and then the logic/foundry is up overall. And when you net it all out, it's basically a flattish profile. The customer mix, you have -- you do have a number of new projects continuing to take systems, but you also have the -- I'll call them, the more mature legacy customers in China that are also part of that mix. So I think it's continuing to be healthy, I think, through this year. And I think the profile as we -- even beyond this year feels like it kind of continues more or less at current levels. Obviously, those are like half to half [indiscernible]  and in any given quarter, we'll see some movement. But that's how we see things today. Yes, Chris, you're seeing all the things you want to see, right? You're seeing pricing improve, customers are taking up utilization. Utilizations were very low. And so there's a fair amount of capacity that's been out there. We're seeing the profitability improve and ultimately, that will translate into cash flow and then what we expect to be investment next year. I think we're seeing more in DRAM driven by the leading edge of DRAM or expect to see more there. And then, of course, the drivers related to its high bandwidth memory. But I think in some ways, it's the device market -- part of the market is improving this year, and that will translate into investment next year. Well, it's certainly a factor in the growth that we're seeing this year. So I've been pretty open that I thought that we'd be somewhere between $250 million to $300 million of incremental service this year versus in 2023. And I think we're closer to the top end of that range than the bottom. So it is a factor. And given the nature of process control and the complexity of our systems, the mix and the relatively lower volume, our customers tend to rely on us to ensure that they're optimizing their capital, particularly in environments when capital is constrained, yields matter a lot. And so our utilizations never drop as much as process tools where they have more redundancy, but we are seeing it continue to improve. And so I think it's a good sign in terms of the overall market health and our confidence about some of the growth drivers into next year. Well, I think our confidence is pretty good. We've made a lot of investments around the company in '21 and '22, both in terms of our own capacity, but also to ensure that our key suppliers have the capacity to support that kind of demand environment. So we -- it's one of the reasons why my inventory levels today are higher than -- and they continue to grow even where the market has corrected some because of the commitments we've made to ensure that the suppliers keep that capacity in place. So we feel very good about our ability to leverage what we have. I don't think we really have to make a lot of big investments to be able to support that trajectory. And I think we'll -- because of the investments, I think, frankly, they're a little bit of a headwind today in terms of the margins. So I think over time, the leverage opportunity is also compelling if we see the kind of growth environment that we expect over the next couple of years. It wouldn't be a quarterly conference call without your question, Joe. So [ 9.9-ish ] we're going to file the Q in the morning or sometime tomorrow, I think, $9.9 billion. It was down about $750 million quarter-on-quarter. Deposits are about $677 million. We also have new products that are going to support the substrate transition as the substrate integrates into the package. On the inspection side as the lines and spaces shrink in the connecting layers. It will drive the need for more capability for more advanced inspection and metrology systems. And so any time you add sensitivity, you add capability, there tends to be a throughput or a volume hit, so it creates an opportunity for us to sell higher ASP systems so they have more capability, but if you're going to maintain the same sampling rate, then you will need more systems. So it's all a factor in terms of all these factors that are all positive in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunities. Yes. I think I don't think it's going to -- it will be a little bit stronger potentially in the second half than the first, but not much because like I said earlier that expected DRAM investments in China, I would expect in the second half to be lower than the first half. Yes, it affected the March quarter as we had some shifting around, frankly, affected a little bit the December quarter and the March quarter, but the shifting around to make the December quarter work, obviously, the shortfall was in March. So I don't think anything has really changed. I don't expect to see much activity from that customer until we get into '25. I mean, look, things could change, we could see some surprise. But right now, at least from a planning point of view, we put it in '25, and if it pulls in great, we can support it. Gen 4 is highly demanded across nodes. It's a very configurable system. And in fact, we recently introduced a non-upgradable version specifically for gate-all-around.  So, it's a product that has a lot of extendibility. It's been challenged in terms of supply -- the ability to get supply to meet demand. I would say -- and we will see some increase this year in revenue from that system, which it hurt us last year just because we weren't able to get any incremental supply around key components. I'll see that increase this year. And so that will help. I still think lead times are probably in the 18- to 24-month range for that product, although we do a lot of juggling to make sure that we're in a position to support all of our customers. But it has demand on multiple fronts, and I think it's a testament to its extendability and the favorability of a broadband system, which has the ability to scale the [ wafer plants ]  to meet very different inspection requirements across multiple nodes. Gen 5 is in the same ballpark."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining the earnings call to discuss the December 2023 results and the March quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. \n We will discuss today's results release after the market close and available on our IR website, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our full year references all relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP -- of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the earnings material posted on our website. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on 10-Q and 10-K.\n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and the December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker-than-expected leading-edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment.\n KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry-leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion.\n Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue improved 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all 3 of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today.\n Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high-throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolved critical yield challenges.\n KLA's Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves.\n In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth maps.\n I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance. \nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge.\n Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million, and free cash flow was $545 million.\n As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchase of intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long-term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted to 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook.\n Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months.\n Based on current [ vast ] schedules and our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid- to high $80 billion roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top-down assessment of industry demand as follows: In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading-edge node development.\n Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments.\n Foundry/logic is expected to be slightly up with leading-edge investment returning to modest growth levels. Legacy investment declining versus 2023 and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels.\n As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of Semi Process Control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%.\n Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.\n Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat from the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter.\n For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares.\n In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations.\n The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends.\n In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling.\n That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you can just give the instructions and set up the queue. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: It looks like relative to your prior view, the March quarter came in lower by roughly about $200 million. I know you talked about a customer project delay that materialized just over the last couple of months. It looks like based on your December quarter end market mix and expected March quarter mix that it's a foundry/logic customer. Was that a leading edge or mature node customer, was the delay more technology-related or just weak demand trends? And does the sequential growth outlook beyond March assume that this customer comes back this year? \nBren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business, too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter.\n So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers where the fabs are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained.\n So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy. \nHarlan Sur: No, I appreciate the insights there. Your total process control systems business outgrew WFE yet again, right, in calendar '23. Within that, Inspection significantly outperformed, right? It was only down 5%, but your Patterning business was down almost 20%, which is actually worse versus WFE. And it's like most of that full year underperformance was due to the sharp drop-off in patterning just in the December quarter. So was that tied to the customer pushout dynamics, as you mentioned? Or is it just the lumpy shipment trends in patterning? And I guess, do you guys expect process control systems business to outgrow WFE this year? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think -- if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading-edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection. And that's what we saw in '23. \nBren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was. \n The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here at KLA. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: I just wanted to go back to the pushout. So that I just sort of understand, if we were to adjust for the couple of hundred million that's now pushed into the June quarter and assumed it was still in the March quarter, I guess, would you still expect that the June quarter would be up quarter-over-quarter? Or would it be more flattish like we were thinking or talking about last quarter, just the first half kind of still being a similar run rate of the business? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think it's more the latter, right? We've, obviously, got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided was [ $2.450 billion ] right? We ended up outperforming by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I like sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve. \nJoseph Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're going to -- you'll file your 10-Q probably tomorrow, but any color on where the RPO stood exiting the quarter? \nBren Higgins: Yes. So RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yes, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits. \nOperator: Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, first question, can you speak to domestic China? And I guess, to what degree '23 was helped by bare wafer and reticle inspection and your thoughts on how that progresses in '24. And I guess with the mix shift to perhaps maybe incrementally more DRAM. And I don't know in terms of the really core legacy some shift is there. How are you seeing your kind of implied market share '24 versus '23? \nRichard Wallace: So for China -- C.J. I think overall, for China it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher [indiscernible].  I think the memory piece will shift to -- potentially shift to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall.\n So feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question, C.J.? \nChristopher Muse: No, you covered it. I guess, for my follow-up, as you think about kind of second half stronger than first half, how would you kind of rank order leading-edge foundry logic versus DRAM in terms of the key drivers for you? \nBren Higgins: I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say -- I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading-edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I have 2 of them too. One is, I was just kind of curious, Rick, if you can kind of give color how to think about China revenues this year ex EPC? \nRichard Wallace: Well, Bren just covered that, but -- in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish, little less infrastructure than we saw, especially, in wafer and reticle continues to remain basically level at this current run rate. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. If I look at kind of like where your optical inspection is and you said that revenue should start improving over time. Where is the lead times today for them -- today versus, let's say, 3 months or 6 months ago? And where do you expect them to go over the next few months? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have -- right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between 7 and 9 months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame. \n So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the -- within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into '25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in '22. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: I want to ask a few questions. Maybe just -- I think someone might have had asked this earlier in the queue, but taking your WFE sort of outlook for flat to modest based on your '23 base level, flat to modest growth this year, relative to sort of the pickup and maybe your revenue and WFE being sort of in the second half kind of modest, right? You probably would need to see an acceleration in the back quarters of the year in order to kind of get to say even towards the mid -- the low to mid-single-digit kind of growth that you're talking about for WFE at the moment. So I'm kind of curious, do you see process control intensity type of profile of spending this year sort of neutral in terms of WFE, do you think intensity is higher or lower, relative to this -- again that profile of spending this year? And then how does that reflect in your revenue? \nBren Higgins: Yes. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high single-digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the 7% depending on your WFE number, but assuming you're $87 billion to $88 billion in WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24.\n And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading-edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now. \nBrian Chin: Okay. And then just given that emphasis this year on memory conversions and upgrade activity, can you comment on the areas where KLA benefits and how meaningful a benefit that this sort of spending represents? \nBren Higgins: You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that's tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increase as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity, it will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading-edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. \nChristopher Caso: I guess, the first question is kind of looking beyond 2024 and, obviously, don't expect you to provide any guidance there, but take any opinion that you have. Some of the other equipment suppliers that have had longer lead times were starting to express a little more confidence on a turn on '25. I don't expect that you've seen that in your order book yet, but interested to see what your customers may be talking about. \nRichard Wallace: It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long leads on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations.\n But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be. \n And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both reticle business but also is a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth as leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next 6 months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now. \nChristopher Caso: Got it. That's very helpful. As a start-up, with regard to the foundry/logic business, would you characterize, and I guess, what you talked about your WFE assumptions is some kind of slight growth this year. Is it safe to say that, that growth is either tied to new node deployments and kind of technology upgrades and such as opposed to capacity at this point? \nRichard Wallace: It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion in our capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially, the newest technologies. \nBren Higgins: And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: You talked about memory utilization remaining low. And, I guess, I feel like you guys kind of talked about that relatively early, and then you saw it kind of static. We've heard from memory customers, all kinds of things about different times that they brought it down and like some of them bought it up. I just want to confirm that you're seeing that as kind of a steady trend? And then can you talk about how that affects your the services revenue you can get from those guys? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone right now. And so when we talked to them last year, it was -- there's a lot of [indiscernible] looks about -- because they had been ready for a much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than -- historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down the utilization on our systems have chosen not to.\n And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year. \nBren Higgins: The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So they take capacity offline for a process, they tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick's statement, it's been fairly flat overall.\n And DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it's been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: Bren, you talked about strategic alternatives for the display business. Can you help us out how big the display business was last year? And then in general, on the EPC business, there are kind of auto is starting to [indiscernible] mobility is getting better. Can you just talk about how you're looking at the EPC business, excluding display? \nBren Higgins: You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display they are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher-end customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering.\n The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of 2 businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging.\n So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. ICOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity-centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half.\n PCB has been more mobile-centric in terms of in more consumer markets more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high-end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023. \nAtif Malik: Great. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about uncertainty in leading edge with some push out. If your foundry customers decide to focus more in putting these investments of fabs in Japan versus U.S. Is there an impact to your business? \nRichard Wallace: Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that.\n So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. \nYu Shi: First off, I really just want to ask for some clarification about the service business expectation for calendar 2024. I think that you talked about higher forecasted growth in service. Is it higher than what you thought at the 12% to 14% this year? Or if you're just talking about higher growth than compared with your systems business? Just a quick clarification. \nBren Higgins: Yes, more in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year. \n But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So we'll be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins. \n Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin. \nYu Shi: Maybe another question, maybe a little bit longer term. I think in the past, you talked about particularly some of your leading-edge customers reusing their capacity in the past and may put a little bit pressure a few cycles ago on your overall growth. Your largest customer, I think, last week, talked about maybe converting some of the 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer. We don't know whether they're going to continue to do that. But any thoughts there and looking a little bit ahead, do you expect any sort of negative impact going forward? \nRichard Wallace: The -- you're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to reuse whatever they could. There's a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is the technology that they're going to need for [ 3 ] and then for [ 2 ] is upgraded from what they have at [ 5 ].\n And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be -- historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we've seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago.\n But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there's nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I wanted to ask about book-to-bill. So it's below 1 for the fifth quarter in a row. It's up a little bit. It's up to like 0.9. So you're reaching some sort of like steady state. But it's a much different dynamic of what's sitting in RPO than what used to sit in backlog because you used to have 4 to 5 months worth of backlog.\n And now if you assume half of the stuff is parked outside of 12 months and half is inside of 12 months, I mean it's not, I guess, that different than it was before, but you still have this $5 billion plus it's parked beyond 12 months and that was never there before. So as we look pre-COVID and post-COVID, what changed? Why is there this $5 billion worth of bookings or RPOs just parked beyond 12 months? Because it isn't like your lead times have gone out that far. And I understand that with those long lead times, but it has always been long lead times. So what's kind of changed for you? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening. And so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out.\n And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been [ cleaning ] up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you notice, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive.\n So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter. \nTimothy Arcuri: Yes. Yes. I mean it was up, definitely. But I guess just my follow-up on that is what's the advantage? If I'm that customer and if your lead times are well inside of that, what's the advantage if I'm a Chinese customer to booking something that's kind of sit in your backlog it's -- but parked beyond 12 months? I mean, unless I'm worried about export control and maybe, I think, because I have something I've given you a down payment that entitles me to get the tool, like is that part of it? I still don't know why I would park something like way, way beyond your lead times? \nBren Higgins: Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders. \n So I think it comes down to you're one -- if you're one of those customers who want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. So -- and in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't our -- I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans. \nTimothy Arcuri: Well, that's a ton of customers that we actually never heard of before. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I have 2 as well. The first one is on high NA. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect among some of your customers in terms of, I guess, their appetite to take tools and to develop using those tools. Curious, how you're thinking about your potential insertion of high NA over the medium to long term? And how should we think about the positive impact to your business from an intensity standpoint? \nRichard Wallace: Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for high NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of NA -- of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable in memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with -- the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features.\n It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run. So you need to run, for example, a BBP tool at a higher sensitivity, which, as you know, requires -- we keep adding capability, but it does require more capacity to cover the same amount of silicon to support that. So it's a very good transfer for Process Control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now. \nToshiya Hari: That's very helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Bren. Just on the display business, so it's 1.5% of revenue last year. I'm curious if you could speak to the profitability of that business. I mean, to the extent you do end up, say, selling the business, how should we think about accretion to gross margins and bottom line earnings? \nBren Higgins: Yes, profitability is less than 1.5 -- 1.5% of KLA. So it's 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA's profitability. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you again, everyone, for your time. We know it's a busy day of earnings a busy week. We appreciate it. We'll be in touch with sure all of you over the coming days and weeks. And with that, back to you, Chelsea, to provide any final instructions. \nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation  December Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and the December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker-than-expected leading-edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment.\n KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry-leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion.\n Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue improved 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all 3 of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today.\n Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high-throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolved critical yield challenges.\n KLA's Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves.\n In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth maps.\n I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance. Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think -- if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading-edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection. And that's what we saw in '23. So for China -- C.J. I think overall, for China it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher [indiscernible].  I think the memory piece will shift to -- potentially shift to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall.\n So feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question, C.J.? Well, Bren just covered that, but -- in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish, little less infrastructure than we saw, especially, in wafer and reticle continues to remain basically level at this current run rate. It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long leads on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations.\n But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be. \n And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both reticle business but also is a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth as leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next 6 months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now. It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion in our capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially, the newest technologies. Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone right now. And so when we talked to them last year, it was -- there's a lot of [indiscernible] looks about -- because they had been ready for a much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than -- historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down the utilization on our systems have chosen not to.\n And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year. Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that.\n So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year. The -- you're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to reuse whatever they could. There's a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is the technology that they're going to need for [ 3 ] and then for [ 2 ] is upgraded from what they have at [ 5 ].\n And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be -- historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we've seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago.\n But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there's nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint. Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for high NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of NA -- of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable in memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with -- the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features.\n It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run.

So it's a very good transfer for Process Control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now."

            "name": "Bren Higgins",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge.\n Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million, and free cash flow was $545 million.\n As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchase of intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long-term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted to 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook.\n Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months.\n Based on current [ vast ] schedules and our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid- to high $80 billion roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top-down assessment of industry demand as follows: In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading-edge node development.\n Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments.\n Foundry/logic is expected to be slightly up with leading-edge investment returning to modest growth levels. Legacy investment declining versus 2023 and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels.\n As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of Semi Process Control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%.\n Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.\n Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat from the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter.\n For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares.\n In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations.\n The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends.\n In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling.\n That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Harlan, it's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business, too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter.\n So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers where the fabs are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained.\n So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy. Harlan, it's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was. \n The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here at KLA. Yes. I think it's more the latter, right? We've, obviously, got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided was [ $2.450 billion ] right? We ended up outperforming by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I like sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve. Yes. So RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yes, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits. I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say -- I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading-edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half. Yes. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have -- right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between 7 and 9 months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame. \n So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the -- within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into '25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in '22. Yes. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high single-digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the 7% depending on your WFE number, but assuming you're $87 billion to $88 billion in WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24.\n And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading-edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now. You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that's tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increase as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity, it will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading-edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business. And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place. The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So they take capacity offline for a process, they tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick's statement, it's been fairly flat overall.\n And DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it's been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on. You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display they are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher-end customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering.\n The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of 2 businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging.\n So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. ICOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity-centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half.\n PCB has been more mobile-centric in terms of in more consumer markets more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high-end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023. Yes, more in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year. \n But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So we'll be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins. \n Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin. Yes. I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening. And so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out.\n And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been [ cleaning ] up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you notice, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive.\n So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter. Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders. \n So I think it comes down to you're one -- if you're one of those customers who want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. So -- and in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't our -- I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans. Yes, profitability is less than 1.5 -- 1.5% of KLA. So it's 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA's profitability."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the September 2023 quarter and our December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins, to discuss our results released today after the market close, which are available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials.\n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified, our full year references all related to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick. \nRichard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter and outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. At KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through these terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon.\n Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74. Both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA teams continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments.\n The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy nodes, despite softness in Memory and learning edge, Logic & Foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity.\n KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio.\n Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer in adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employing deep learning and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV Lithography, and advanced packaging.\n KLA Service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track for high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion.\n In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams.\n I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all 3 coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges.\n Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77.\n Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.\n The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid.\n I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level at an approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally, on that date, KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets.\n Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our Wafer Fab Equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021.\n KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology advancements and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology roadmap investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership, and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.\n As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%.\n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus one percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid 61% range.\n Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense, net, of approximately $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares.\n In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology roadmaps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sizing our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology roadmap requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations.\n With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis.\n We are confident that Process Control's importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better-than-market performance of our Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks.\n Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please provide the instructions to queue for Q&A, and we'll begin now. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: I wanted to revisit your suggestion that first half could be stable at this -- the December quarter levels. So does it mean you're not expecting any change to your China shipment? Or if you could just kind of give us how you are thinking about the mix in different end markets and geos. And then kind of part b of that is, what assumptions are you making about the timing of memory recovery? Is that still kind of second half awaited and can it be incremental to this kind of conceptual first half outlook? \nBren Higgins: Vivek, it's Bren. So we are -- I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment.\n I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels. \nVivek Arya: And anything on the potential recovery in memory, like if, let's say, memory were to be recovering in Q1, Q2, Q3, is that visibility you would necessarily have? Or if I ask it in a different way, what is kind of the difference between when you start to see it and when it actually starts to show up in your sales numbers? \nRichard Wallace: Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently, they've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: On your Services business, close to 25% of your sales, you'll be driving high single-digit percentage growth this year, and that's with your customer production activity at an all-time low. But in your shareholder letter, you guys say that you expect growth in Services to accelerate to your target range of 12% to 14% next year. I know you've got to waive off tools and systems coming off of warranty and on to contract. This would be a big driver. But what else are you guys assuming on the strong growth outlook for next year? And what are your assumptions for industry manufacturing utilization? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. But, you did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year, is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high.\n So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slow down that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes. \nBren Higgins: I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have -- depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business. \nHarlan Sur: Great. That's hugely insightful. Given the strong lineup and aggressive cadence of tech transitions, right, especially in foundry and logic and that's obviously driving more EUV layer adoption, right, which is driving demand for both your optical inspectors, reticle inspection, your entire portfolio of metrology products as well. If we look into next year with more tech inflections, gate all around, introduction of backside power distribution, next-gen advanced packaging architecture, is that wave of new tools, systems adoptions to support these transitions. Is that still in front of the KLA team? Or are you actually starting to see quite a bit of that now? \nRichard Wallace: Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar '24 and [ beyond ]. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joseph Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: First is for Bren, I know it will come out in the queue, but can you help us with the RPO where that was exiting the quarter? \nBren Higgins: It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in that kind of context, how do we think about the optical inspection lead times? I think you mentioned that the demand remains stronger than supply, your ability to supply, but how do we think about that looking into this first half of '24? Do we expect that you'll start to see maybe some of that alleviate in the first part of next year as we get into more demand into the second half? \nBren Higgins: Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in '24 than we have in '23. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. \nChristopher Caso: I wonder if you can speak a bit about the China business right now. A little more color on the strength that you're seeing and you obviously heard this from your peers as well. And I think the investor questions right now are about the sustainability of the China revenue at these areas. I wonder if you could address that. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken, most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board.\n But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both [indiscernible] and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any -- I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics. \nBren Higgins: In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to -- so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary.\n So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a -- in excess of $800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat.\n You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of '21 and '22, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots. So as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make. \nChristopher Caso: Just as a follow-on to some of the other things you said with -- as you're starting to fill some of those orders for, say, some of those Chinese customers that were -- you weren't able to fulfill because of some of the shortages before, what effect has that had on the backlog? And is your backlog visibility going out in time about the same as it was last quarter, a quarter before? Or is that backlog visibility is starting to shrink as you catch up on some of those orders that you weren't able to fulfill before? \nBren Higgins: I would say with new business coming into backlog, that it's not changing all that much. \nChristopher Caso: Right. So about the same. \nBren Higgins: I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply-demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer [ demand ]. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: Bren, in the past, you have talked about the China domestic spending as 1/3 memory makers, 1/3 kind of mature foundries and 1/3 as a new entrant into the market? And my question is like you're talking about China to drop somewhat in Q4, which segment of the China market you're seeing the drop off in Q4? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I'm not -- I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't -- I'm not -- we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that. \nAtif Malik: Got it. And then, Rick, I have a question on gate all around. Historically, you guys have benefited when the transistor move to FinFET architecture. And as we start to see initial orders on gate all around for some of the deposition companies, can you talk about what that gate all around opportunity means for both inspection and metrology for KLA? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, gate all around has been in development for a while. So we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to gate all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So we're well prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated.\n Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafers, and also some of the specifics around the High-K Metal Gate control that people are looking for.\n So more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So we've worked with development partners on that, feel well positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: I want to ask about the DRAM strength that you guys are seeing. It seems like that was the main source of revenue upside in the quarter, and it looks to be -- based on your comments, down slightly in the next quarter in [ calendar ] Q4, how much of that strength is coming from shipping to the DRAM customers in China that you alluded to in the past? And how much of that is tied to advanced DRAM technology, high bandwidth memory and whatnot. And when you look at Q4, which part of that segment is going to come down? \nBren Higgins: Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really -- the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But -- and then you get just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to. \nRichard Wallace: One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related [ HDM ]. So that is also a driver -- smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now. \nSidney Ho: Okay. Great. And maybe a follow-up for me. If you look at the SPC systems revenue, it looks like it's going to be down 5% to 7% in calendar '23. I think a quarter ago, that number was like down 10% to 12%. Can you talk about what has changed? Is it just that the WFE market has improved somewhat? Or are there other KLA specific reasons that you will point out. But more importantly, how do you think that outperformance will do next year considering some of the areas that you are strong in this year may see some moderation? \nRichard Wallace: I'm sorry, for EPC or that was SPTS? \nSidney Ho: Yes, that's for SPC. \nRichard Wallace: Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength -- we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong, we talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading-edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there. \nBren Higgins: Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to not only provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers.\n So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we move through this year. Process control intensity is helping in, I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in '22 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic/foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick or Bren, I'm curious, you mentioned like the demand profile stays in the first half of next year. But some of your peers have called calender '24 like a transition year. And how do I overlay the fact that memory could rebound in the back half of next year, how to think about these industry WFE or KLA revenue profile next year? \nRichard Wallace: So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what '24 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels.\n What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term products that are products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into '24 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. that's certainly a factor. Well, of course, we watch our customers' business models, their profitability, their cash flows, that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year.\n In our near term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do.\n And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not -- we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near term is reflected in [indiscernible] \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. As you said, the recent export control work has no material impact to your outlook? \nBren Higgins: And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the -- I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex. \nOperator: Next, we'll have Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, everyone's asking about 2024 WFE, but I guess I'm still a little confused as to what the right baseline is for this year, because pretty much everyone has now guided for Q4. So if I take you, plus Applied, plus Lam, yes, it's down 13%. So that would mean that your $80 billion number might be in the ballpark off of that mid-90s last year. But if I include ASML, it's like flat. I mean even if you exclude the fast shipments, it's fairly down. So how is WFE down this year? I guess I'm just trying to get some understanding of like how you get to that $80 billion number. Is it excluding ASML somehow? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what -- we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late '22 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in '22 and how that shows up in '23.\n But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our belief about our market position. And if you look at Semi PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me. \nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. All right, Bren. And then I guess my second question is on inventory. It's now up to almost 300 days. It's up like $500 million over the past 6 months, but we're not really sure when WFE picks up inside of next year. I get that you still have this huge $10.8 billion worth of PO that you're kind of working off. But why is this stuff parked so far out in the future? Is it -- and if so, why hold the inventory now? What's the bottleneck? Is there something on your side still that's a bottleneck? Or is it more that the orders have been placed and maybe waiting for the fab, to be ready to take the equipment and that's why you're building up the inventory. I guess I'm just not sure why you would build the inventory if this stuff is still parked so far in the future. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15-months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. So, we had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions.\n We manage our -- so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry.\n And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity, high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. \nYu Shi: This morning, I think one of your smaller peers in Europe, they talked about seeing some weakening of the mature in foundry/logic side of the WFE. I wonder if KLA is seeing something similar. I mean either through your process control business or the EPC business? If not, why is that? And I have a second question. \nBren Higgins: Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent. \nYu Shi: Got it. So Bren, maybe a question on OpEx. Both of your peers in the bay area, they are raising their OpEx for basically the next calendar year. How should we think about KLA's OpEx going into next year, say, you talked about you're expecting revenue to be run rating at the current level, should we be thinking OpEx is kind of flat until you see the uptick in the revenue. I mean before you really raise the OpEx. \nBren Higgins: Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in Service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels. Our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements.\n And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of topline when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through '24, but not a big change, more in line with general kind of cost to living type adjustments overall. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: You talked about maybe a little bit of weakness at the cutting edge of foundry logic. Wondering if you could talk about that. And then I guess, just contextually, if we're in an environment where there's very aggressive investment in gate all around and backside power, but there are sort of limited wafer requirements in year 1 for those technologies. I would think that helps KLA in terms of percentage of WFE, but can you just walk us through how much of your -- how much money will they spend on the development of those processes versus the expansion of wafer, that capability there? \nRichard Wallace: Well, so we still -- we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see -- that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you are in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, one or two generations. So on balance, doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense.\n So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the -- so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry/logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry/logic to memory. And memory is increasing some. So yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we found for 2026, is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging. \nBren Higgins: Yes. The roadmap schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more N3, you're going to see N2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And -- but most -- the bulk of it will be more at N3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back.\n But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading-edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or -- and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. \nBlayne Curtis: I just wanted to follow back up on the comments you just made on foundry logic. So it was flat. It seems like China is probably up within that mix, and then you said leading-edge is weak. I'm just kind of curious how that changes for December. It seems like the outlook is fairly flat. So is that weakness in leading-edge kind of stabilize, and then kind of any perspective as to where leading-edge goes next year? \nBren Higgins: So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, right, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here. \nBlayne Curtis: I just want to ask on Service, in your letter, you talked about getting back to that 12% to 14%. I just want to know, is that assuming any utilization increases? Or is that just purely the tools coming off of their agreement? \nBren Higgins: Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract. I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into '24, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Just a quick follow-up. As you think about the R&D price, especially you highlighted gate all around at some point, we have to change the narrative to High-NA. And I want to just get an update, how do you see kind of opportunities as it relates to High-NA specifically on the patterning? And I have a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling -- we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scaling. So High-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength.\n So part of what our modeling is when we book -- we don't see a lot of High-NA happening in the timeline that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive -- continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity. \nMehdi Hosseini: Are you implying that Gen 5 could be -- the use of Gen 5 could be extended to High-NA for patterning. \nRichard Wallace: For sure, absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out-ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption.\n So it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind in the -- on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the High-NA, then hyper-NA, which is going to come after that. So we feel very good about our optical product portfolio. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then the second follow has to be on China, it seems like for KLA and the peer group, the China mix is getting closer to 50%. Could there be a scenario where opportunities for KLA would actually step up given the fact that many of these customers are new, and they have yield issue. And I understand China is mostly for [ trading-edge ], but with new entrants, new players, with the higher entrances and improving yield by these new players, have a higher mix of China for KLA relative to the peer group? \nBren Higgins: Well, you have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now as they continue to put roadmaps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node.\n But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to -- because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along roadmaps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will higher in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: I'll just ask one question then get us out of here. But -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've gotten a sense maybe that given how strong the infrastructure bear wafer and reticle inspection business into China was this year that it could subside a little in the calendar '24 relative to its strength again this past year. Is that sort of implicit in your outlook in the first half next year? And also, do you think that is proportional in any way to sort of the rate of China fab bill out activity that you can maybe observe for next year? \nBren Higgins: Well, I don't think it's -- I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will -- that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So there's -- that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you Brian and thank you Chelsea. I just wanted to thank everyone again for their time and turn the call back over to you for any final instructions. \nOperator: This does conclude the KLA Corporation's September Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter and outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. At KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through these terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon.\n Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74. Both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA teams continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments.\n The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy nodes, despite softness in Memory and learning edge, Logic & Foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity.\n KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio.\n Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer in adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employing deep learning and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV Lithography, and advanced packaging.\n KLA Service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track for high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion.\n In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams.\n I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren? Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently, they've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes. Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slow down that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes. Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar '24 and [ beyond ]. Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken, most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board.\n But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both [indiscernible] and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any -- I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics. Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, gate all around has been in development for a while. So we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to gate all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So we're well prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated.\n Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafers, and also some of the specifics around the High-K Metal Gate control that people are looking for.\n So more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So we've worked with development partners on that, feel well positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that. One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related [ HDM ]. So that is also a driver -- smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now. I'm sorry, for EPC or that was SPTS? Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength -- we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong, we talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading-edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there. So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what '24 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels.\n What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term products that are products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into '24 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that. Well, so we still -- we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see -- that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you are in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, one or two generations. So on balance, doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense.\n So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the -- so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry/logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry/logic to memory. And memory is increasing some. So yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we found for 2026, is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging. Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling -- we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scaling. So High-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength.\n So part of what our modeling is when we book -- we don't see a lot of High-NA happening in the timeline that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive -- continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity. For sure, absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out-ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption.\n So it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind in the -- on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the High-NA, then hyper-NA, which is going to come after that. So we feel very good about our optical product portfolio."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all 3 coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges.\n Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77.\n Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.\n The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid.\n I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level at an approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally, on that date, KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets.\n Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our Wafer Fab Equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021.\n KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology advancements and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology roadmap investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership, and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.\n As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%.\n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus one percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid 61% range.\n Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense, net, of approximately $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares.\n In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology roadmaps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sizing our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology roadmap requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations.\n With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis.\n We are confident that Process Control's importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better-than-market performance of our Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks.\n Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Vivek, it's Bren. So we are -- I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment.\n I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels. Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. But, you did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year, is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high.\n So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers. I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have -- depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business. It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in '24 than we have in '23. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer. In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to -- so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary.\n So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a -- in excess of $800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat.\n You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of '21 and '22, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots. So as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make. I would say with new business coming into backlog, that it's not changing all that much. I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply-demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer [ demand ]. Yes. I'm not -- I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't -- I'm not -- we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that. Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really -- the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But -- and then you get just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to. Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to not only provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers.\n So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we move through this year. Process control intensity is helping in, I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in '22 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic/foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to. Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. that's certainly a factor. Well, of course, we watch our customers' business models, their profitability, their cash flows, that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year.\n In our near term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do.\n And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not -- we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near term is reflected in [indiscernible] And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the -- I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex. Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what -- we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late '22 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in '22 and how that shows up in '23.\n But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our belief about our market position. And if you look at Semi PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me. Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15-months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. So, we had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions.\n We manage our -- so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry.\n And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity, high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success. Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent. Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in Service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels. Our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements.\n And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of topline when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through '24, but not a big change, more in line with general kind of cost to living type adjustments overall. Yes. The roadmap schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more N3, you're going to see N2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And -- but most -- the bulk of it will be more at N3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back.\n But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading-edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or -- and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases. So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, right, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here. Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract. I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into '24, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen. Well, you have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now as they continue to put roadmaps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node.\n But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to -- because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along roadmaps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will higher in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project. Well, I don't think it's -- I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will -- that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So there's -- that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability."
